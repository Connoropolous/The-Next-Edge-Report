The start of the crisis of 2008 is only a result of what went wrong already a long time and the challenges we face today and turning this situation around in the next 5 to 10 years is all a result of mismanagement of too many areas in our society. So once we know or have a clearer pciture of where and how we make things happen to get us out of the current impasse, we will need Enabling Leadership style at both corporate and government level. People who listen and steer towards what the crowd is highlighting and such a leadership can only function if it has the knowledge and the attitude to collaborate with others - experts or whatever you want to call it - on solutions which are longer lasting then next year profit and next 5 year goals achievement (read stay within budget no matter what, etceteras...) but focusing on the next 5 generations - hey that is only shifting our vision fro, 5 to 100 years, it can't be that difficult! :) \\nOk, we need to train those leaders today because UI have not come across many of those, neither in corporate nor in government circles. We are all still busy with how to get out of our current individual challenging situations. Though that is important as well, we need to steam up leaders who can dedicate their 'career' being busy with how to avoid these type of challenges for the next and next 5 generations. These solutions need to be build now, otherwise we keep in too small circles of misery for generations to come. \\n\\nSo I am not so sure whether Enabling Leadership is the only style of leadership we need at this moment. It is only one of them. We need to be more actively involved in identifying the other styles needed and defining how to train \/ educate those future leaderships.  They are now in highschool and so far their education is far from adjusting to even the current situation.\\n\\nWhat do you say\/think?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-16T19:02:26+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzYxODM4MzgzOTAzOTIy\",\"before\":\"MzYxODE0NzMzOTA2Mjg3\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_361820037239090\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"Cheryl Anderson Spensieri\",\"id\":\"100000459286693\"},{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Cheryl Anderson Spensieri turned me on to this guide to health, environmental, and social impacts of products (after she reinvented the idea then found out that it had already been done). \\n\\nThey have a mobile app you can use while shopping.

But, it's various methods over the past 100 years left millions of people to suffer and die more indirectly than outright murder.  Those people were dismissed as relatively unimportant, mostly left to die from deprivation rather than outright execution.  In all systems, some rationale was created to either dismiss people and leave them to die, or, kill people outright.  In the end, for the victims, the result was identical.\\n\\nIn that context of disposing of people, by all economic systems, and with capitalism having become predominant, financial profit came to rule the day.

Since I was young my interests were very wide; I was open to explore new domains just for the adventure.  However my focus was limited and often there was no connection between the different domains, so it was like many books on the shelves of a library - each stored but not interacting.  I also was attracted to quaiity insights from others that were counter to established views; and the history of ideas told how many new established ideas were once underground and even suppresed.  I was open to parts of ideas of others and was able to see value in those parts, even when I knew the whole idea was flawed.\\n\\nPossibly as a consequence of my not having mental imagery (for thinking and remembering) in any sensory modality, in my \\\"conceptual-emotive imagery\\\" I would \\\"grok\\\" \\\"rapid over-flights\\\" of many previously isolated domains. This is analogous to studying the complex visual diagrams becoming popular today; but mine were neither visual nor verbal.  Over time, pairs (or small groups) of domains would be in my workng mind - and when they returned to long-term memory they were now linked.  Eventuallly most of my domains were linked (in my unconscious) into one vast network.  My worldweaving mind\/brain then worked to build a better synthesis, making minor modifications of ideas in each of the many domains. Each time a modification (Piagetian accommondation) I had I experienced a flash of insight - often leading to a cascade of insights - the consequence of which I often was unable fo follow up many of the insights - but they remained in my woven, inner world. Following each accommondation I was open to rapid assimmilation of information prevously blocked and found myself especially alert to this new information when I encountered it.\\n\\nOver decades I have had many hundreds of, IMHO, major insighs (and thousands of minor insights), each which could keep me busy for the rest of my life; many could keep teams busy for decades.  Some were \\\"inventions\\\", but I lacked the competencies to bring them to production amd marketing.  However, I discovered that, for me, each insight gained its relevance and significance from being a node in my whole, integrated, inner woven world - which had emerged over time to be radically different from the inner worlds  of almost everyone else.  Many persons would acknowledge parts of an insight (given they were willing to devote the time to study it); but no one ever inquired of me for clarification  or asked to learn more.  Many would recommend that I pick one and focus on it - and forget about the others and the whole.  I actually tried this a number of times; but each attempt soon led to my need to work on other insights that were interdependent.

There isn't a single term you used in the above paragraph that is a mystery to me. If we both gave say the term \\\"philosophy\\\" or \\\"complexity\\\" our own definition, i.e. \\\"in my\/your own words\\\" surely they would differ greatly. I've never had a problem with the terms people use. If I don't understand how a term is being used, I will just ask questions until I understand.\\n\\nOn the other hand, consistently over the last several decades, people have asked me, \\\"What do you mean by x?\\\" as though I were making up words or speaking pure gibberish. I think a lot of the time it's just bad faith. I've never had a problem conversing with children. Children seem to grasp the meaning of my sentences, and when I use a word they don't know, they immediately ask me what that word means. Adults, it would seem, choose not to understand, or to suspend understanding for some ulterior motive I haven't diagnosed yet.\\n\\nA discourse by definition has its own terminology. And personally speaking, I think the English language has enough words and its syntax is versatile enough that almost anything can be expressed effectively. If others don't understand what I am saying, either they lack understanding or I lack communication skills. It's not because what I am trying to say is too complex for the average person to understand, since as I said children seem to understand perfectly the meaning of my sentences.\\n\\nI agree that the usage of words, terms, concepts evolves relative to other terms in clusters.. that's partly what one does in discourse analysis, isolate said clusters and study their evolution, emergence over time, in the formalization of said discourse.. I use science as the perennial example of a \\\"discourse\\\" because in science something happens which doesn't always happen in discourses: Hypotheses, conjectures, theories, reasonings, etc., can be proved true or false.. theories build on other theories, sometimes disrupting a discourse or a cluster of concepts within a discourse.. it has a seemingly \\\"linear\\\" evolution though I say \\\"seemingly\\\".\\n\\nAnd there are frames and frameworks, schemes as well, again I agree. I call them frames of reference, but conceptual scheme works. I guess it would all be much easier if we all had an agreed-upon Ontology that we could use when making statements. What I mean is it would be quite useful if we could speak to one another like computers speak to one another, what we call \\\"machine-readable\\\" could have an equivalence amongst humans, call it \\\"human-readable\\\". We could have Ontologies, Taxonomies, other standards, protocols and so on, similar to how Browsers can all read web-pages, humans would be able to read and interpret one another mechanically.\\n\\nLanguage was supposed to take care of that, facilitating communication between peers. Science and philosophy and the arts were meant to improve communication, in part by improving our understanding of the world so we could ensure we are speaking about the same things, etc. Definitions - by definition haha!!! - I see like a form of \\\"cutting\\\", you have a bunch of dough on the table, you take out a cookie-cutter, your \\\"definition\\\", and you cut a shape into the dough that is the shape of your \\\"definition\\\". The \\\"label\\\" has fixed boundaries, yet you and I both know it is arbitrary, because the dough can equally take an indefinite number of other shapes.\\n\\nSo words, terms, concepts, etc. are also arbitrary and are subject to change through usage. Somehow, though, we understand one another a great deal, which is a mystery to me. I call it hermeneutic triangulation.. there is a language user, Larry, a world of objects and events, and another language user, me (Alex). When you speak, I maneuver within the triangular communicative relation between Larry-as-language-user, the world of objects and events, and myself-as-language-user.. yet these three elements never appear as discrete entitites when we communicate.. The meaning of any particular utterance can have a different meaning for different language users.. yet somehow I am capable of \\\"triangulating\\\"..\\n\\nI love the idea of \\\"Vector Terms\\\" precisely in this way, in terms of hermeneutic triangulation. I'm not sure I understand what you Larry mean by \\\"Vector Terms\\\".. I am taking it at face value, terms which are vectors of terms.. and new meanings perhaps could be made by multiplying vectors of terms.. Hermeneutic guessing involves triangulation, yet is an ongoing attempt to align or to triangulate your discourse with language used by other language users and with the world.\\n\\nYou see, I disagree with process-oriented models of communication. I find that process-oriented models fails to explain how we come to understand one another despite the interpretive complexity embedded in our day-to-day communicative interactions. No process can adequately describe the necessary and sufficient conditions that allow me to successfully interpret your utterances.\\n\\nThe vectorial approach might be the answer I'm looking for.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1224823408\",\"name\":\"Larry Victor\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":21,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-13T21:30:25+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"360762254011535\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"Larry Victor the simplest explanation for my \\\"theological reactions\\\" not making any sense, is that I'm not making sense!

John clearly identifies this as a global phenomena. This indicates a clear motivation and need to innovation, but at the same time there is no reward for those involved to remain the commitment in any respect.\\n\\nSo what John Hager suggests:\\n \\n\\\"The future of business belongs to the feminine archetype. Those that adopt the feminine archetype, male or female, are going to be the ones to create that wealth and enjoy the success of this new world.\\\" A business model based on the feminine archetype is about relationships, not transactions. According to Hagel, the masculine archetype that dominated 20th century business was strictly competitive, not collaborative, and a zero-sum game. The masculine projects a strong image at all costs. In contrast, the feminine allows for emotion, intuition, and vulnerability. Hagel says it is not possible to establish trust without allowing for this vulnerability. The result is greater knowledge flows and an environment where more people can participate. With this \\\"big shift\\\", our world becomes a smaller, more connected place--a global phenomenon for more wealth.\\n\\nNote by ecoNVERGE: We fully underwrites this viewpoint and likes to extend to social, political and financial models as part of the New Socio-Poli-Economic model we are seeking!\\nJohn Hager clearly indicates that we need a fundamental shift in mindset related to competition and ownership of knowledge. The resolution is to participate in enriching knowledge flows with our own tacet knowledge through open but trusted environment, scaled to a massive scale.

If someone wants to convince you for secrecy the next question is what he wants to hide from public. - IMHO there is a ranking of legitimations concerning projects- in the best case it is vanity (\\\"I am the best to fulfill the project's vision\\\") and peer group habit (e.g. LSE). Un the worst case it is a \\\"never give, never share\\\" mentality, deep rooted in the mentality of economist education - and that has brought us to the state of the world. It is horrible if one realizes that there are ca. 10.000 \\\"business schools\\\" around the world still programming the next generation in the spirit of competition+fight instead of collaboration+cooperation.\\n\\nAs I have written thinking about a \\\"planet school\\\" network replacing the old mind set - from kidnergarten onwards to university:\\n\\\"the elite of tomorrow, the leaders in politics and economy are educated \u201cas usual\u201d. The mindset in 10.000 business schools worldwide is quite unchanged\\\"\\nhttp:\/\/socialforesight.wordpress.com\/2011\/07\/11\/planet-schools-global-change\\n\\nThe concept of planet schools. Efficient global change.\\\"\\n\\nEuropeans are - though less taboo laws exist vs the USA - perceiving and using Facebook as a personal online experience, related to close friends and family. Americans - all but the north-east, as there are as much differences in regional cultures in the US but kept a big secret from the national flag and constitution - however have adapted a mutation of integrating social media with business networking. As I have lived and worked 10 years or more in Europe, Americas and last in Asia, I have experienced - sometimes in a hard way - those deeply rooted cultural differences, to a point that I maybe do no longer know what my roots are and thus I have declared earth as my home - at least for now :). but no kidding, I have taken bits and pieces from all these cultures - regional and loca -l and adapted myself in an amalgamated personality which many can't understand how or what I am... Example, while I still recogniwe the difference very clearly and probably justified between social media and business networking, I promote and act across platforms and actually integrate itnensively my presence and my openess, mixing my private and business life. Well to a certain extend as that is where my European or Belgian roots come in and ensure my personality being respected without hiding things which should be known by the circles of my connectedness.\\n\\nAllow me to give another example which typifies the cultural aspect of personal perceptions of traditional cultural values or habits continued online. In SE-Asia, the majority of people have adapted - both among each other but more so towards foreigners, sometimes justified - a culture of first let me know what you can do for - rather let me earn from - you ; compared to European general approach - due to crisis of the last 4 years this value has been seriously lost in many perspectives - which is\/was\/should be: 'what can we do to collaborate and gain mutual results'. On one hand I can tell you that I have been betrayed last year by an English guy, an Asian person - 3 actually - and even worse by 2 Belgians.\\n\\nWhat have I learned and to a certain extend concluded from those experiences: to a large extend we - indeed WE - have lost our basic and in many ways common values across the globe and across cultures, putting \\\"I\\\" before anything else. Even myself, I find myself doing some of that and every time re-correcting myself.\\n\\nThat is why I have started ecoNVERGE and spend auite some time to come up with the 3 words: INSPIRE, HARMONY, BALANCE, which are to be relived and revalued across the globe as they are commonly understood as core rooted and golobally accepted or recognized values as such.\\n\\nSo as we have learned in so many classes and management courses, put those things which matter or value to you the most, right in front of your eyes as that should be your drivers, even if you fail to exercise them, you can always correct and re-align to your core values... That is what is missing in this current world of selfishness and though we preach SOCIAL everywhere, we have lost the value of SOCIAL which is a common value across cultures as well.\\n\\nSo how do we adapt or ensure we return to those values: in what we do every minute across our connectedness, starting in our family and spread out the way we see a better world and DO it - NOT TRY IT!\\n\\nRelated to your example brought forward: To a certain extend there is some truth in what the person told you, even though there is a very wrong approach in how he or she approached! You should be on platforms which provide the right avenue for such investments, but at the same time it should be very acceptable to relate those publications or articles on the so-called 'social web' or platforms and that has mainly got to do with the bringing of awareness and approaching a wider audience and light up some interaction around our core issues and values or regain those. \\n\\nThat is where Willi's point of starting from the basic of education needs urgent reforms: we need to learn again what our core values are and which ones are changed and to what extent they influence our rooted values and how we adapt - then the bigger issue is: how do we adapt across generations - very though one as some generation gaps are growing wider and wider and the demographics and marketing segmentation is only adapting a tip of the iceberg of that complexity. And then there is the adapting of different cultures across nations, regions...\\n\\nGentlemen there is still a lot of work on shop before we can speak of a true flat world.. We are only just starting to learn , rather experience why we are what we are today... It is also rooted in civilization of mankind that we will figure it out, but it takes losses and hardship before we get there...\\n\\nThe future is bright, even though we do not see it today - therefore the individuals AND - more important - the  or better a new leadership style is still in the making to coop with our current 4th paradigm of humanity.\\n\\nAnd that time taken is a good thing, though we - majority of the 7billion people - are suffering from today's situation in which no leadership is YET recognized - let stand practiced.\\n\\nFor now:\\nInspire \u25cf Harmony \u25cf Balance \\nInspire one - 1x = X1 - motivate many! \\nWE are Unlimited! \\n\\n@ ecoNVERGE\\n\\nAnd now I have to write this down in a blog (WordPress) \u2013 my first time real blog... anyone who likes to assist  need a good writer!\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-11T13:29:35+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"359851870769240\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jeff Mowatt\",\"id\":\"813379376\"},\"message\":\"Dead men do talk \\\"Finally, is it acceptable to build projects with stolen property?

I will refrain from reading up on it if you want to test the subgraphics on me, or other versions of the infographic. Either way, I have no interest in the matter (interest in the sense of \\\"vested interest\\\"). I find it unfortunate that the point didn't get across to me.

I just shared my first impression. After having said impressions, I read the comments which mentioned what I was already thinking. The comments gave it away, that the \\\"private consulting firm\\\" impression was the wrong one.

A few moments ago Glistening Deepwater was even asking people to help define it would seem the terms \\\"Sustainability\\\" and \\\"Resilience\\\". In the name of defining things, I have a few questions of my own I'd like to ask. I'm not sure how to pose these questions so I will try to be brief, but I warn you there are numerous concepts and questions floating around in my head.\\n\\n1) In The Next Edge, I have noticed have noticed countless threads on topics such as the Tragedy of the Commons (the Commons in general), the Principal-Agent Problem, Optimal Decision-Making (in Groups), Systems Thinking, and so on. I have read such great comments on hard problems in network theory, with regard to complex adaptive systems, and so on.\\n\\n2) Lately, there has been talk of 'Collaboration', or what we could call 'Efficient Group Collaboration'. I have also read much about different institutional and organizational structures, moving away from the 'centralized' towards more 'horizontal' structures. There has been talk of deliberative democracy, i.e. Deliberative Polling and so on.\\n\\n3) There has been much talk about sustainability, viability, resilience, etc. of organizational structures.. an 'ecological', 'systems' take on management, one could say, or consensus decision-making.\\n\\n4) I am concerned with something specific and would like the Theorists amongst The Next Edge to chime in. I want to take a specific, concrete example and apply cutting-edge game theory etc. to it. I want to see what the best minds of The Next Edge have to say about this concrete example.\\n\\n5) The example is Petty Corruption or Incidental Corruption, let's say within the confines of a Democracy.. so a form of bureaucratic and political corruption, but more than that, what seems to be a fundamental problem in almost all systems of Governance worldwide.\\n\\n6) We have talked about the free-rider problem, about the principal-agent problem, about social dilemmas and social traps.. we have talked about strategic interaction, about human behavior in groups, about stigmergy in social insects.. I would like to know what factors encourage systemic corruption, decentralized vs. centralized systemic corruption, and petty or incidental corruption, political corruption.. I don't want to cast the net too widely and cover \\\"all forms of corruption generally\\\".. I want to take a specific example, but at the same time I'd like to ask a simple question:\\n\\nWhat is Corruption? How can we characterize 'corrupt behavior' in general and in particular? Once we have done that, then we can look at Incentives (conflicting incentives), Conflicting Interests, and the failure of an organization or process, lack of transparency, culture of impunity, etc.\\n\\nMany organizations are doing anti-corruption research at the moment, the world over. It appears that Open Data and Transparency are key tools in solving the problem. I therefore want to ask: In game-theoretic terms, how can we efficiently model a Corruption Game? What about agents' Risk Attitudes, Beliefs, and Information in the Corruption Game? what is the influence of risk attitudes, beliefs, and information in the behavioral choices of agents in a Corruption Game? Is it as simple as selfishness and a free-rider problem? or is it more complex, a principal-agent problem? How do 'corrupt behaviors' propagate through a network and how can we model that? In other words, how does corruption 'flow' and how can we control that flow, maybe even mitigate it, stop it, etc.?\\n\\nLastly, how should we characterize the 'Corruption Game' itself? What category of game is it? What are the stakes, who are the stakeholders, what are the individual and collective costs and payoffs? Can we model it as an evolutionary system? What would the fitness function be? How can we relate the Corruption Game to the seemingly paradoxical nature of consensus decision-making in democratic institutions? How does democracy fail to solve real-world problems in a timely manner? What breaks down, what are the breaking points of the democratic decision-making process? How can we improve it? How can we eradicate corruption? In other words, it is a mechanism design question.. How do we design a political system where corruption is non-existent or maybe even impossible? How can we design a political system where decision-making is swift and efficacious? What factors are at play, what processes? What is it we aren't seeing?\\n\\nPlease throw your best systemic thinking to the question.. or non-systemic. You may choose to take a thermodynamic approach, a systems approach, any approach you want. I'm curious to know how we can model and characterize the Corruption Game, by playing with incentives, costs, payoffs, microeconomics, behavioral economics, behaviorism (schedules of reinforcement), information, beliefs, risk, transparency, accountability measures and so on.\\n\\nAn example of a possible solution in a democracy could be a simple as Voter Recall. In other words, if people are unhappy with an elected political party, they can vote for a Recall. A new election takes place immediately. One of the risks of this strategy however is that you can get instability in governance, where the elected party changes too often. Another solution could be to not have parties at all, moving closer to deliberative or direct democracy.. The Corruption Game could be endemic to representative democracies, we would have to look at that too.\\n\\nThe Bigger Picture though is not just to look at anti-corruption measures. I think that the Corruption Game can be a great source of insights and solutions for all sorts of problems, namely problems in efficient collaboration in groups and problems of adoption, like the paradox of the mainstream adoption (non-adoption) of energy-efficient technologies..\\n\\nAnyway if you have read up to this point, I thank you kindly. I merely want to spark conversation. I know that there are many great minds here in The Next Edge, and I've seen you comment on these underlying topics and concepts before. I just thought since we seem to be hearing more and more about Corruption in the world, that the Corruption Game could serve as an interesting toy model to smash our brains against. Hope you are well.

Linking annual bonuses for civil servants to the overall growth rate of the private economy (after Singapore's precedent at http:\/\/is.gd\/flexiwage)\\n\\n2. Introducing eGovernment solutions -- accessible via Internet centers and cell phones -- that improve business climates and remove opportunities for corruption, as outlined in these clips from Kenya (http:\/\/is.gd\/PbNX) and Ghana (http:\/\/is.gd\/PbSU). Access to the transparent eGov solutions can be offered as an optional, fee-based service, enabling local gatekeepers to generate a new revenue stream without uprooting the established system.\\n\\n3. Creating \\\"islands of transparency\\\" - free economic zones - that lift taxes and administrative burdens. Free zones offer a fast path for implementing new business climates in targeted areas, without stirring opposition from interests who block deep country-wide reforms as mortal threats to their graft opportunities. Paul Romer's Charter Cities proposal is one approach for creating islands of transparency, as are \\\"success-sharing free zones\\\" led by respected local private sector allies rather than foreign governmental partners.\\n\\nSuch initiatives -- individually or combined - can rapidly bring oxygen to entrepreneurs, microfunders, and employers in troubled regions. \\n\\nGlobal challenge offers by philanthropies of microvouchers (for grassroots access to eLearning and eHealthcare) could reward areas that apply one or more of the above transparency reforms. These offers could also encourage local residents to create non-corrupt land registries and to bypass corrupt court systems, as explored at http:\/\/is.gd\/charity and http:\/\/is.gd\/softpower.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1341377803\",\"name\":\"Alex\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":4},{\"id\":\"651687465\",\"name\":\"John Robb\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":100,\"length\":9}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-11T18:01:32+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"359946010759826\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Thanks, Mark Frazier.

Something doesn't make sense to me. In the case of an elected official, a representative, say, who engages in corrupt behavior, accepting bribes or whatnot, I would think that they would care too much about their reputation to take the risk. They seem at least to care a whole lot about their public image. So why would they risk ruining themselves politically, ruining their careers, usually for monetary sums that really aren't that considerable?\\n\\nI'm thinking mostly of politics in Qu\u00e9bec where I live. We are part way through a Commission now (an Inquiry I guess you'd call it) that is bringing a lot of nasty stuff to light. We also have a special anti-corruption squad that is wreaking havoc in the criminal underground, showing what the connections are between the mafia and construction companies and those who give public contracts and so on.\\n\\nWhat I find weird is the kind of money that is changing hands. It doesn't seem worth it to me to be convicted of fraud or whatnot or have my reputation, my credibility, my legitimacy ruined for life, just for a couple of bucks (or who knows, maybe even risk jail time). There's something I'm not seeing. Even in Qu\u00e9bec, the argument that it's for power doesn't really stand either, because our politicians don't really have all that much power. So is it fear, then? Fear that the mafia and other criminal organizations will harm your family?\\n\\nI still want to find out what the factors are. Is it the way the political system is structured in Qu\u00e9bec? Or does it have more to do with how powerful the mafia is? Are the allegedly corrupt politicians just pawns in a bigger game? I'm trying to see what the incentives are, the disincentives, the payoffs and the costs.. Is it a weird form of peer pressure to? Are they lone gunmen or are the orchestrated in groups?\\n\\nAnyway Mark Frazier I haven't been able to look at the resources you posted yet.

Being 21 and a student with the predictable debt load (before I learned what was up, stopped borrowing money, and started taking a 'slow learning' and pay-as-you-go approach) it's not hard to beat my other assets, but in fact, I don't know WHAT kind of quantitative value you could put on my reputation because it has already led to two priceless life experiences which only hint at what is possible in the future with you all, and who knows how much what I've learned from you is 'worth'. The two experiences, both this year, I mentioned were an experience in London England with George P\u00f3r at 12 Commons-Based Economy seminars, and the whole Emerging Leader Lab experience in New York. Oh yeah, also one time I invited Jean Russell to come by my house in Waterloo for supper and we had a superb conversation. So partaking in this community really is an investment for me, and I've already felt like this community has invested in me. In the face of the wicked crises, I was thinking today about how investing in one another is truly the best thing we can do. I feel both a privilege and a sense of responsibility around being one of the youngest next edge members, in the sense that what I learn from you all is important because we're considering together how the positive ideas we discuss might get passed on to my generation and younger still. Within the next few years I hope to move into the very space of un schooling and learning facilitation that Jerry mentioned in his trust talk. I don't doubt that this network will come in handy when that time comes, and my reputation too :) Be well all, Connor\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/359737497447344\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/359737497447344\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"application\":{\"name\":\"Facebook for iPhone\",\"namespace\":\"fbiphone\",\"id\":\"6628568379\"},\"created_time\":\"2012-10-11T04:37:06+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-10-11T12:44:56+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"725829941\",\"name\":\"Arthur Brock\"},{\"id\":\"817210174\",\"name\":\"Jonathan Sundqvist\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"736739458\",\"name\":\"Jean Russell\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"},{\"id\":\"100000459286693\",\"name\":\"Cheryl Anderson Spensieri\"},{\"id\":\"1264727595\",\"name\":\"Mark Jagdev\"},{\"id\":\"660337950\",\"name\":\"Lynne Desilva-johnson\"},{\"id\":\"562561843\",\"name\":\"Matt Richards\"},{\"id\":\"661659256\",\"name\":\"Mushin Schilling\"},{\"id\":\"100001272536005\",\"name\":\"Joachim Lohkamp\"},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"},{\"id\":\"48909907\",\"name\":\"Ari\u00e9 Moyal\"},{\"id\":\"648098840\",\"name\":\"Hildy Gottlieb\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NjQ4MDk4ODQw\",\"before\":\"NzI1ODI5OTQx\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"359744640779963\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Hildy Gottlieb\",\"id\":\"648098840\"},\"message\":\"Bless you, Connor - what a gift for me to take to sleep with me tonight.

The big problem arises when this individual wisdom (signal) is not transferred to the global population and the process begins again with a new target.  \\n\\nOf course, mileage may vary, but the point is that the ability to use present knowledge to retroactively evaluate past experience *and* to communicate that evaluation out to the collective intelligence substantially changes the fitness landscape for sociopaths.  \\n\\nOne might go farther - periodic FMRI for everyone in the network for example.

He was essentially nothing like the political libertarians you might argue with - personality-wise he was more like a Muppet. But he'd spent over a half-century thinking through how human affairs could be structured entirely by voluntary association and negotiation.\\n\\nEven he felt that there had to be some kind of external enforcement mechanism for covenants. Basically, when you make a spot contract, when you agree to something with someone and fulfill the agreement on the spot with no significant delay in time between promise and fulfillment, formality isn't needed. But once you introduce a significant gap between the start and end of the transaction, moral hazard opens up.\\n\\nConsistent with this, if technologies and norms for co-ordination make it possible to take activities that used to be beset with delays, and to synchronize them so that explicit pre-co-ordination can be replaced by simultaneous spot co-ordination, then you can expect the need for explicit covenants in those areas to decrease.\\n\\nMobile phones have us all pre-co-ordinating our activities less. We can organize on the fly. This general pattern can expand to include more and more economically productive activity over time, but you can't actually take time out of reality. Turning minerals and crude oil into cell phones will always require co-ordination across time.\\n\\nStill, the impulse to do away with explicit agreements and to design for spontaneity is productive. Existing as we do in the time period where Moore's Law remains in effect, the potential for shifting many activities to flash-work or swarm-work is huge.

The sociopath\/provocateur can thus hide behind people's natural desire to not rain on the party. Unless negative\/constructive feedback is made a requirement, part of the daily routine, people will tend to avoid generating conflict and, possibility, being perceived as the provocateur themselves.\\n\\nFor example, in the project I was involved in, we used hand signals to facilitate discussions. Everybody was comfortable waving their hands (to indicate agreement without having to take a turn speaking), but the \\\"thumbs down\\\" was almost never used. (Side note: the \\\"occupy\\\" version of the \\\"I don't agree\\\", that I'll call the \\\"raining fingers\\\", is less culturally charged and might have resulted in wider use.)\\n\\nWe need both Yin and Yang. While I would agree that positive reinforcement is more motivating, and should probably be favored, constructive\/negative feedback is essentially as important in order to make informed decisions. Of course, going to far with this results in traditional corporate practices, where negative feedback and reprimands are the norm. As usual, the key is in finding a good balance. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that by making this constructive feedback systematic and structural, people are freed from some forms of counterproductive self-censorship. If\/when mechanisms require constructive feedback, the potential for catastrophic reactions is reduced. Otherwise, conflict only becomes apparent once they are at a boiling point and, often, have become intractable.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T15:30:37+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216115765142852\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kurt Laitner\",\"id\":\"554482123\"},\"message\":\"@curtis just as bankruptcy law has served capitalism well so shall forgetful systems serve the network economy\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T15:33:35+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216153311805764\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"message\":\"Curtis Faith - Alpha isn't on facebook, though i had coffee with him last week :)\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Curtis Faith\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T16:34:32+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216157278472034\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bret Weinstein\",\"id\":\"82300937\"},\"message\":\"Yes.

So implicit rules could have been, hey I promise never to kick you in the *ss for no reason, or spit on you, etc., the list goes on. Explicitly, though, we made commitments. Ex.

Bady is particularly effective in using links in his writing. And he's a very sophisticated observer. So, part of the essay that's notable is Bady pointing out how in seeing lots of academics talk about  live blogging conferences, he had a pre-formed narrative ready to place the conversation in context.\\n\\nAh, but then he figured out that the narrative he had in mind probably wasn't relevant to what had happened at all.\\n\\nNo doubt the media spends a lot of time on trivial matters. In someways that's really good, sports, the weather and pop culture provides some necessary social glue. My sense is that this sort of trivia messes up our thinking less than do the shared narratives like: \\\"The youngs with their social networking! The olds with their curmudgeonly disdain for same!\\\" Bady points to in his essay.\\n\\nThe metaphors we use or the narratives we use to frame our thinking about experiences often simplify too much.  \\n\\nI'm not well-read about systems intelligence, which is contrasted with systems thinking is an innate type of human intelligence versus a model for thinking. Raimo P. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Esa Saarinen have developed a 5-part hierarchical model for thinking about the amount of systems intelligence a person has. I suspect the idea of levels of systems intelligence is a good way of thinking, but I'm not really comfortable with the 5-levels they've described. I'm unclear why one level is higher than the next.\\n\\nMaybe H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Saarinen's hierarchy is rough and ready enough to be useful. Anyhow my sense of it is that rather than to worry too much about trivia, a better cure is to look at complicated issues with the levels of systems intelligence in mind. http:\/\/thenewinquiry.com\/blogs\/zunguzungu\/my-norm-is-more-normal-than-yours-academic-tweeting-and-loose-fish\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-07T23:56:29+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"358528417568252\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Systems_intelligence\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-08T00:00:37+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"358529124234848\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"id\":\"1120956519\"},\"message\":\"(Weird...I had a zine in college called Loose Fish.....way back in the Pleiostine Era...)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-08T00:03:58+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"358529554234805\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"id\":\"1120956519\"},\"message\":\"Also on a bit of a tangent - great Point of Inquiry podcast on libertarians as systems thinkers...

The medium of television has certain effects despit who owns the media and who is watching television. I mean the medium-in-itself.\\n\\nRadio does not have the same effect on people as television, regardless of who owns it, who spends advertising dollars there, despite the content being broadcast, and despite the demographics of who is watching.\\n\\nI think it's all of the above, the media, those who own the media (media conglomerates et al), those who pay for it (advertisers & the like), the content itself (and the sources of that content), those who consume it, but also the medium itself, its inherent properties as a medium despite the rest.\\n\\nAbout complexity, beyond a certain level of complexity, like beyond 2+2=4, I don't think humans are really all that capable of dealing with it (I exaggerate slightly). I don't think we can have truly complex thoughts, we certainly cannot simulate complex systems in our minds' eyes.\\n\\nWithout getting too heavily into algorithmic information theory, let's just say that the information content or complexity of an object can be measured by the length of its shortest description. I use algorithmic information theory because we are talking about media, namely television, and not complexity in terms of complex physical systems like protein networks.\\n\\nI think we need to be careful with the term \\\"complexity\\\". Are we talking about complex \\\"behaviors\\\", complex \\\"mechanisms\\\", complex \\\"systems\\\", complex \\\"data\\\", complex \\\"reality\\\" (whatever that means, i.e. a complex \\\"world\\\"), or complex \\\"problems\\\"? complex \\\"networks\\\", or \\\"social complexity\\\"?\\n\\nIn the case of television content - to finish with algorithmic information theory - there's a limit to how much complexity can be represented in the medium. Different genres too have constraints, limitations. There are limits to what can be effectively represented or described. Again, the human brain has severe limitations when it comes to true complexity. We need things to be broken down into chunks and we can only deal with a few chunks at any given time. Sure, you can build a complex architectural structure with only a few simple Lego blocks, but in one's mind, one cannot build it all in one fell swoop, unless one has an IQ of 290 or something or is an idiot savant.\\n\\nI don't know any mathematician who can solve a complex system of linear equations in his\/her mind. But with a pen and paper, it's possible, but it won't happen all at once. You have to go step by step, and the fact that life is sequential, linear, and thinking often is also sequential and linear.. there's a limit to the complexity that one can actually physically - cognitively, neurologically - apprehend.\\n\\nAlso, I'd like to know what kind of television are you watching? I have just basic cable, only a few dozen channels\/networks. I do get sitcoms, but I also get serious documentaries, I have entire networks devoted to political debates, serious investigative journalism, and so on. Plus, it is in the nature of the sitcom genre to do what the author accuses it of doing. It's hard to make comedy that doesn't trivialize and banalize to some extent. It wouldn't be funny. There are many exceptions, of course, i.e. George Carlin et al.\\n\\nI also wonder about the statement that we are living in an \\\"increasingly complex and confusing world\\\". Are we really? Do you really think the world was less complex in 1914? in 1939? I don't think what I would call \\\"social reality\\\", i.e. \\\"human life\\\", \\\"everyday life\\\" is any more or any less complex now than it was 10 or 20 years ago.\\n\\nActually, I find that my everyday life has been profoundly simplified since the advent of computer and networking technology. In my eyes, it was much more complex to try to find pertinent information\/knowledge at the library than it is finding it at home on the WWW.\\n\\nFinally, I think the term \\\"rhetoric\\\" is being misused. It is in fact impossible to represent something on television without rhetoric, especially if it is fiction. A newscast is by definition rhetorical, so is a narrative or story. I'd say any and all representations are inherently rhetorical.\\n\\nOne last thing, in conclusion. I'd go so far as to say that most of what we physically and cognitively deal with in life is actually not all that complex. The universe is very complex, but I'm only dealing with a very puny portion of the universe. In my immediate environment, there is complexity, obviously.\\n\\nIf you take all the books on my shelf and all the knowledge they contain, that's pretty complex. The fan blowing fresh air from the window is complex too, it has many moving parts in an arrangement etc. But in reality, the \\\"world\\\" I am inhabiting at the moment couldn't be more simple. I am drinking a cup of coffee, smoking a cigarette, and commenting on Facebook. A sitcom could make fun of this, and they often do. But what \\\"complexity\\\" would the sitcom need to describe or represent when what it is representing is simple as pie?\\n\\nAn example just to disprove the hypothesis. The television series \\\"Lost\\\" was a pretty huge success, I mean it had lots of viewers. From Wikipedia, \\\"A critically acclaimed and popular success, Lost was consistently ranked by critics on their lists of top ten series of all time. The first season garnered an average of 15.69 million viewers per episode on ABC. During its sixth and final season, the show averaged over 11 million US viewers per episode.\\\"\\n\\nFunny fact, I tried to watch it and it didn't make any sense to me so I stopped watching. I happen to be extremely intelligent. But apparently 11-15 million Americans were either smarter than me, or simplicity, banalisation, trivialisation is not the only factor in what makes a television series popular.\\n\\nDecade by decade, I think the arguments in the article are either false or skewed. It might be true for the first decade of television broadcasts in America.. we are talking about American television shows\/networks\/broadcasts, right? In Qu\u00e9bec where I live the arguments just don't hold. We have such talented writers, even our soap operas are anything but simple, banal, trivial, and so on.\\n\\nAnother thing.. television is often only a means for Entertainment. Entertainment is another beast altogether which I won't go into. By far the most watched television broadcast year after year is the Super Bowl (take the aggregate number of viewers + number of Super Bowls, it's ridiculous, matched by few other televised events). Or take the Olympics.. do you see how the argument immediately falls apart entirely? Not to mention that American Football is quite complex as far as games go! hahaha\\n\\nSorry but is the Super Bowl propaganda too? Sorry to go on and on, but I'm really smart and I have trouble understanding American Football. It's anything but simple, and yet the Super Bowl is one of the most watched things on television (21 of the Top 46 network prime-time telecasts are Super Bowls!!!)\\n\\nWhen you put the Entertainment factor into the equation, the argument falls apart. Serious documentaries about complex social, economic, political realities I wouldn't really call \\\"Entertainment\\\". If the flak is against the Entertainment industry.. then maybe I can understand. The other question is of what the author says about \\\"brand identities\\\". A similar thing applies when building brand associations. Brands must be consistent, and have to have a limited scope, a limited number of brand associations. And do I really need television ads to represent or describe the complexities of the world? What is complex about cleaning toilets, brushing my teeth, or doing laundry? The ads would be different if they were trying to sell me complex financial instruments even experts have a hard time understanding..\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"828553957\",\"name\":\"PJ Manney\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":20,\"length\":9}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-07T20:48:38+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"358476297573464\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"PJ Manney\",\"id\":\"828553957\"},\"message\":\"Sepp:  Huh?

In 1993 Los Angeles (4 years earlier than in this piece), few people had cells.  Some people in film production and management had them, but you didn't see them everywhere.  Usually only people who thought they should be important.  ;-)\\n\\nCut to my husband arriving in Auckland, June 1993.  Everyone had a cellphone.  Every member of his crew, to the lowest carpenter.  At one point, he had 1000 employees.  He was the only person who didn't have a cell.  And he was the boss.  He held out as long as possible: eventually his crew mutinied and insisted he have a cell, so they could call him wherever and whenever.  Why did he hold off so long?  He loved to drive or exercise unconnected.  He loved to clear his head from the office to the set and back, concentrate on what needed to be thought deeply about and then get back into the fray once he arrived at his location.\\n\\nOnce they forced the cell in his hand, that all ended.  He says it's made his job harder, not easier.  He was putting out fires more and making big plans less.\\n\\nHOWEVER, the writer does not take into consideration the reason why NZ and Australia had phone penetration well before the US: the US is RARELY the first market for technology developed outside it.  And often, not even inside it.  Countries like NZ, with small, demographically diverse first world populations, are the world's test market.  I would see new versions of US brands of toothpaste I only saw 6 months later in the states.

Jacky makes the observation that hierarchies generally rely on a one way communication, that of broadcast; such communicatiions necessitate centralization and mass communication of whatever the system may be...health, education, 'news', pop music, whatever...and has the corollary effect of generating the mass mindset and sungular methodology of our specialized culture.                                             ...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-07T19:35:07+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"358454684242292\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Where I live, the policy making is hierarchical, but certainly not expert-based.

I agree that it is useless to claim that there is no place for the broadcast methodology, positive feedback has its place, but we are all too aware of what happens when 'interference' becomes amplified through such a process, the results can be deafening and can drown out the vital voices providing negative feedback and the approximational role modelling neccesary for the human to achieve what Viktor Frankl analogized as 'crabbing'.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-07T19:53:22+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzU4NDU5OTk0MjQxNzYx\",\"before\":\"MzU4NDU0NjU3NTc1NjI4\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_358309667590127\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Rehan Allahwala\",\"id\":\"1223542276\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Make's me soooooooo happy to see a political party from Pakistan finally reaching out to Technology to empower them selves, I hope other's will follow the same around the world. !!!!!

But here's what I think is wrong with this picture. Again, this paper uses a confusing language about p2p. airbnb and WhipCar are mentioned as p2p systems. They are NOT true p2p systems. They are platforms that allow p2p transactions, but these platforms are NOT owned by the peers themselves. The owners of the platforms can sell data about reputation of users. This is why the author is asking the ethical question \\\"who should own the data\\\". We've heard that many times with Facebook. Well, this is not a problem that falls from the sky. This is created by design!!! These guys are fully aware of what they are creating, they understand the value of their harvest. They also understand very well that this game gives them power and control. Let's not assume for a second that this is just an unfortunate side effect of a natural thing... This is MADE BY DESIGN. \\n\\n1) people should wake up and realize that if we don't work hard enough to create true p2p alternatives to all these feudal-type systems we'll get trapped into very powerful attractors with huge switching costs. I know a lot of people that hate Facebook and can't get out of it...\\n2) we should refine our language and make these distinctions between what's p2p and what's not p2p.

Nothing is intrinsically bad, but everything is potentially dangerous. Rather than decry the wrongness of these new systems, it is surely more productive to identify their dangers and discuss how to best avoid them. I commented on Jennifer Sertl's post of the same article: 'The reputation economy is certainly an ambiguous guest. But, as you suggest, Jennifer, she has been invited in, so we may as well find a way to get along. Reputation is certainly essential to developing the trust required to facilitate sharing: this is Botsman's point. Nothing much to be afraid of there, so long as we are simply seeking to replicate and encourage the kinds of interpersonal processes that we use to create trust offline. What concerns me is that online reputation requires a vigorous online presence, and this means engagement on social media. Lots of people I know who enjoy sharing and collcons aren't necessarily fans of social media. So how can they develop the reputation they'll inevitably require to actively engage in the sharing economy? If the reputation economy grows hand in hand with the sharing economy, as Botsman predicts, we'll effectively be forced to to be busy social media sharers too. This will please Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest et al no end, seeing as their business models hinge on gathering data based on our sharing activities... And round and round it goes, for good or bad, no one knows. I can see a fascinating new ecosystem emerging, where the sharing economy is tied to social media via reputation and trust systems'.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-02T22:08:36+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"356723694415391\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Cheryl Anderson Spensieri\",\"id\":\"100000459286693\"},\"message\":\"Very interesting thread!

I cannot imagine p2p arriving first... the mentality and the know how was not there. The difference between you an I, and I respect you a lot, is that I am an activist. My attitude towards evil is different. But hey, the world needs both of us! \\nI do believe that once things are created, naively, out of pure passion and compassion, evil people, and I hope we agree that there are evil people on this planet, realize the potential and try to exploit them to their advantage. It's just a matter of time before a university dorm project gets noticed by fat and greedy corporations, governments and their secret services, and gets turned into Facebook. I am less concerned about the wicked student who discovers a new way to make money, and more concerned about those who have real power, and use these new systems to restrict our freedom, to further enslave us. Democracy and freedom is always a step away from tyranny. They are not equilibrium states of our society. They are not stable once established. We tend to forget that. This is why the world needs people like me, even though sometimes I may seam to be abrasive... In fact I'm a nice guy  : ) I hope to catch you one day in a pub. \\nFor me it's about exposing the tyranny that is already swirling around these systems and to incite the multitude to build its own future.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"578568173\",\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-03T00:53:17+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"356750694412691\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\",\"id\":\"578568173\"},\"message\":\"Never found you abrasive Tiberius Brastaviceanu.

I don't know how Bitcoin is doing now, but it definitely took a hit when that happened..\\n\\nA promise is not a good predictor of future behavior.. If someone makes a promise and then breaks it, as in the cases of Airbnb and Bitcoin, the should go from \\\"good connector\\\" to \\\"bad connector\\\", good old binary logic.. Pass\/Fail.. Unless of course the designers of the system want to keep a certain level of risk in the system.. For trust brokerage, that might be a good idea, but then the trust score is only probabilistically so.. and that makes the game extremely complicated.. That means that a score of 75\/100 has the probability P of actually being 75\/100 and the inverse probability of NOT being P..\\n\\nLike in your comment.. a \\\"bit extreme\\\" to me translates as \\\"moderate\\\" and \\\"probably not great\\\" for my personal development is just as easily \\\"probably great\\\" for my personal development, since the exact probability was not made explicit. Probability P that it is not great, probability 1-P that it IS great.

The kind of \\\"trust\\\" and \\\"reputation\\\" they are talking about is not what I'm talking about when I use those terms. I'm thinking of extreme cases where trust is binary, Yes\/No, Pass\/Fail, as in cryptographic applications where a connection is either safe or it is not safe, which is why I use the terms \\\"good connector\\\" vs. \\\"bad connector\\\". There is no grey zone.\\n\\nIf I am sharing classified information, I cannot accept a variable trust score.. A trusted channel either exists or it doesn't, no middle ground.

I could even be a great piano teacher and on the side I could be a criminal or could be prostituting myself, or be using illicit drugs. If it doesn't affect my piano teaching, for you, the student using my service, it's all mostly irrelevant.\\n\\nAggregation is a funny thing. I am seeing certain statistical problems. Also, I wonder about the promise of true \\\"data ownership\\\" in some of these cases. The concept of TrustRank is interesting, except if it is comparable to PageRank, then that would mean that my trust score would be affected by other people's trust scores. In the case of \\\"owning\\\" the data, what would that mean? What use is owning my data if I can't query the database that has everyone else's data? Wouldn't I have to own everyone's data also for my data to have any real meaning?\\n\\nIf anything even remotely close to that is the case, then Houston we have a problem. That very database becomes extremely vulnerable to linkage attacks \/ composition attacks unless they use some form of differential privacy. I basically have to be able to query it accurately without identifying actual records. That's maybe why silos are the norm, it's safer for everybody.

The crux of the matter is, for me at least, that one's reputation should not guide one's behavior. I don't know how else to put it. If I get reputation points for good behavior, and those points are redeemable somehow, or are some form of \\\"currency\\\", then to me that is so backwards it makes me nauseous to think about it.\\n\\nThe thought of a \\\"reputation economy\\\" also makes me nauseous. I think I mentioned that I was a moral nihilist. Basically, to make a long story short, I don't think there are implicit, universally \\\"good\\\" behaviors. The reputation system, then, will be biased towards certain behaviors at the expense of others. Basically, you'd be ranking people by how \\\"moral\\\" they are, which again makes me sick to my stomach.\\n\\nI imagine a world where people are slaves to their reputation scores, trust scores. Their decisions are based on what will make their scores go up. They avoid behaviors that will make their scores go down. How is that different than being a slave to a slot machine? If other people can vote or rate me, then it isn't really all that different than a slot machine, i.e. a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement (in behaviorist terms).\\n\\nThat happens to be one of the most effective schedules of reinforcement. So you would effectively be teaching people how to behave to be \\\"good people\\\". They would learn quickly and the behavior would stick for a long period of time. It's so effective you can use it to make pigeons play piano.\\n\\nIs anyone seeing the problem here? Don't we want the freedom to make fools of ourselves? The freedom to accidentally offend people? If there is no fear of retribution, fear of judgment of others, fear of offending people, hurting people, fear of criticism, etc., then is there really a value to a trust or reputation score?\\n\\nThat's why I believe in an absolutely unforgiving trigger strategy, like a grim trigger strategy taken to the extreme. Trust is binary and it's \\\"one strike you're out\\\". Accountability, again, is meaningless if you just get a virtual token that says \\\"better luck next time\\\". I would have contracts where you maybe even have to pay out some sum of money for breaking the \\\"trust\\\", a sort of \\\"common trust\\\", and you are banned from the system for some period of time, or you get a negative score.\\n\\nHow could that possibly make me nauseous? Well, you have to look at extreme and absurd examples. Think for example of honor killings. You have a family, they have a daughter, and they murder their daughter or lynch her in public because she negatively affected the family's \\\"reputation\\\", i.e. its \\\"honor\\\". This is a reality in many parts of the world. Now think of your reputation system. How biased and Westernized and Christian and bourgeois, almost aristocratic, is this system?\\n\\nI'm not going to be part of a reputation system with my \\\"peers\\\" when my \\\"peers\\\" can be anyone anywhere on earth. If I am tried in a court of law, my \\\"peers\\\" are citizens of Qu\u00e9bec or Canada. If I were a botanist, my \\\"peers\\\" could be other \\\"botanists\\\". As an artist, my \\\"peers\\\" are other artists I guess. The point is my \\\"peers\\\" can't just be \\\"absolutely anyone anywhere\\\". It's maybe off-topic, but I think we need to re-examine the term \\\"peer\\\", because it has become meaningless - to me at least.\\n\\nMy point I guess is that reputation should not be quantified algorithmically. And if my trust or reputation is given a \\\"score\\\", I want it to be my actual \\\"peers\\\", not some arbitrary group of people from anywhere on planet earth. How can strangers know anything about my reputation if they don't know me? What happened to the \\\"content of one's character\\\"? I don't want a machine deciding how moral or immoral I am, since I believe I alone am the final judge of that. And I don't need a machine to tell me what my \\\"score\\\" is.\\n\\nI know that every day I do my very best. I don't do it to get \\\"points\\\" or to \\\"make friends and influence people\\\". I do it because I think it is good in itself. The means are justified in themselves because I am doing it to the best of my knowledge, to the best of my ability. I don't want to be scored on how well I'm doing. Some days I would get negative scores, and I don't need that, I know some days that I'm not doing 100%, I don't need a reminder. I don't need to impress people either.\\n\\nIt seems to be that in these reputation systems people would be doing \\\"good\\\" things only to get noticed by others, to get approbation (approval, endorsement, assent), to be recognized. It's like people who broadcast the good things they have done. Who cares? Do you want a hero-biscuit or a medal? I say nay to reputation systems wholesale. That's part of what I wanted to say.

Some members of my paternal family were involved in the opposition movement (called the Tupamaros), so at that time my family diaspora began, some of them simply to save their lives (an uncle was not fortunate enough), and and others, like my father, because he suddenly lost his job and without the possibility of finding another .. so in the year 1976, my father, my mother, my little brother and me were in the middle of the jungle in Formosa, Argentina. That was a turning point, where my family ceased to belong to the middle class and began a journey of about 10 years, knowing the vulnerability associated with poverty across Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.

The format of the calls is part storytelling, part dialogue\/interview, and part guided practice. If this resonates, hope you can join us. :-)\\n\\nhttp:\/\/www.bizcreativitysummit.com\/\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/356900594397701\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/356900594397701\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-10-03T13:29:25+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-10-03T13:29:25+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"218700749\",\"name\":\"Eddie Harran\"},{\"id\":\"100000646860067\",\"name\":\"Bruce Waltuck\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NjUyNTAzMTY4\",\"before\":\"MjE4NzAwNzQ5\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_356467367774357\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Steve Brant\",\"id\":\"703220850\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"PreFinal Draft of the full page ad I'm planning on buying in the program for the UN Foundation's gala dinner in NYC.

I rather confidently told her that Tumblr or Posterous were the easiest places to put stuff online. When I said that I hadn't actually used Tumblr.  So I made what I thought would be the easiest blog in the world, just post three links a day, to test it out. \\n\\nTumblr is a very easy to use blogging platform. Comments can be enabled and there is a \\\"like\\\" feature. It's also very easy to follow blogs in the Tumblr feed, rather like an expanded Twitter interface. Many people are used to engagement through comments in blogs and find the engagement through the Tumblr newsfeed bizarre. I like it because it's reciprocal; if someone likes a post there's a link to see their blog. I have Disqus comments enabled, but it's rare that anyone comments with them. Direct messages are limited to 240 characters, I think, and no URLs, but that's also a way that people engage.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-30T04:00:50+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"355698121184615\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/protoslacker.tumblr.com\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-30T04:21:41+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"355865621167865\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Tumblr is a blogging platform, Pinterest is more of a \\\"visual curation app\\\" if I can call it that. Pinterest has a grid-like look & feel. You can do the same thing on a Tumblr blog if you wanted. Pinterest though is more about sharing one's tastes. It can be used for \\\"brand curation\\\" too or \\\"product curation\\\", \\\"fashion curation\\\". So can Tumblr, but Tumblr is what is called a Tumbleblog, it's somewhere in between regular bloging and microblogging..\\n\\nI use both. I use Tumblr just as a normal blogging platform. It's a great product and has millions of users. Pinterest I use for different reasons. I use it to share images. It's more of a visual diary of sorts (for me at least).\\n\\nThere are other platforms similar to Tumblr. There is:\\n\\nhttp:\/\/www.soup.io\/\\n\\nhttps:\/\/jux.com\/\\n\\nhttp:\/\/stellar.io\/ (More like for sharing interests and discovering things in one's network)\\n\\nhttps:\/\/makr.io\/ (Similar in a way to Pinterest except you make memes with pictures, i.e. a meme generator)\\n\\nWhat happened is that you had tumbleblogs, then all the curation apps\/tools came out all at once, from Storify to Scoop.it, to Clipboard etc. You had discovery engines too like Zite, esp. apps for iPad like Pulse, Flipboard, etc. You have ones for web too, like Trove, Eqentia etc. Pinterest came out when people were becoming more and more interested in the \\\"interest graph\\\". Remember Hunch invented the \\\"taste graph\\\". So curation apps ended up going more towards interests and taste than just social bookmarking or sharing content.. you have the visual curation kind and that one seems to have stuck, with the grid-like look & feel..\\n\\nThere are now a couple dozen different sites that copied the Pinterest look & feel.. It's similar to Clipboard and Snip.it, though, cause you're sharing content with others, clipping content (in the case of Pinterest you are \\\"pinning\\\" content, in the case of Tumblr I think you can \\\"Reblog\\\".. similar to a Retweet but on a tumbleblog..)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-30T15:56:20+0000\",\"like_count\":4,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"356199027801191\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Daniel F.

Now, because the current chaotic environment makes it difficult to predict what initiatives will turn out to be useful, a combination of personal passion and personal risk-taking seem to be called for.\\n\\nI personally believe chances of success are enhanced when you manage to have access to good advice, get very capable people, and find ways for them to gradually develop their skills and build confidence in themselves and in the team. Being part of a \u2018Scenius\u2019 (the collective form of genius) is a killer way to obtain these affordances.\\n\\nA scenius is more like an ecosystem or a city than an organism or corporation. It can incubate projects and organizations, but is not really an organization. In this day and age, I suspect it can actually stay alive longer than most of the projects or organizations it generates.\\n\\nI think I basically want to be part of a scenius, and I think this very group, The Next Edge, is a coherent scene that foreshadows the nature of an emerging \u2018online scenius\u2019. Some of the conditions outlined at http:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-conditions-favor-the-emergence-of-scenius are already fulfilled here. \\n\\nHowever, I think our group is still missing a few key capabilities. Chief among them, in my book, is the ability to go beyond conversation and knowledge sharing and move into open collaboration.\\n\\nI\u2019d love it if a handful of us were able to get excited and playful about some simple Thing That Should Exist (e.g. \u2018A Poignant Guide to the SocEnt Scene\u2019), and efficiently mobilize our collective resources to just Get Them Done quickly.\\n\\nBasically, we should go for hits. If we can pull off a few small capers, maybe we can challenge ourselves to pull off something more ambitious... you get my drift.\\n\\nEngaging in small projects has many benefits. Some obvious ones are learning and getting to know potential collaborators better (both of which are sure shots, even if the project fails). Engaging in small projects that Just Could Get Big (Cause You Never Know) might be a way to conduct modest-risk experiments towards real impact.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: given the diversity, collective knowledge and wisdom, and quality of engagement of people in this group, I don\u2019t find it difficult to imagine that it could turn into a decent launchpad for promising initiatives, and I believe we should think a bit about this.

Examples are Deliberative Polling\u00ae, GitHub, amongst others. Personally I like what the MIT Center for Civic Media is working on.\\n\\nhttp:\/\/civic.mit.edu\/projects\\n\\nThere are other subgroups within the Greater Next edge (GNE) working on other things. I happen to be part of those interested in building the platform needed if we can't find it. Harlan T Wood is working on Software_Zero, Glistening Deepwater has a series of websites putting together vast amounts of resources\/intellectual capital.\\n\\nThe main idea seems to be that Facebook is failing us, in fact, any platform that does not allow the creation of a true knowledge base or repository is pointless to use. LinkedIn has had groups and conversations going for years and thousands of pages long and the data is stuck in a silo. Searching and navigating the conversations is difficult..\\n\\nThere are others working on other projects, because what I mention isn't a panacea to cure all ills. It's just to say that I've observed the same thing, what I've been calling the failure of collaboration.\\n\\nTask management and project management solutions have been tested. We are putting together preliminary insights\/reviews. Others also have their hands full with real projects \\\"on the ground\\\" and cannot invest hours of time contributing to stuff online. That is partly why the repository idea would be fruit-bearing, because those people could browse\/navigate through conversations.. and not just conversations, but conversations, debates, dialogues that have already been processed, refined, 'mined', in a kind of peer-review process.\\n\\nFacebook makes it hard to find stuff. Findability and Discoverability is next to nil. It's very noisy. I have been building my own model of how Facebook Groups work - not based on how it works archtiecturally or how Facebook designed Groups, but how I see a flock of people using this particular group and how I see it failing everyday in real-time.\\n\\nFor instance. Seb Paquet started a conversation recently asking about people.. um wait.. see I can't find it.. anyway someone asked something and then Seb and others were making a list of people, maybe SuperHeroes or something or specific fields, domains, specific 'parts' of the whole.. a list of people doing sh*t. Now why can't I hyperlink that conversation into this conversation as a reference? In fact, to be quite honest, I had to scroll up just now to verify what thread I was actually in.. I'm in about 50 different Facebook Groups and get 20 Group notifications per hour, sometimes less, sometimes much more.. I don't even know what thread I am posting in anymore, or where it was I read something.. This is Facebook, it dilutes things, it makes things fuzzy, it is not designed for persistence in discussions or debates, dialogue.\\n\\nPart of it can be solved by people adopting some process or methodology. Good luck with that. Even if we already had the perfect platform, we'd still have the adoption problem. We'd have to make it 'designed-for-adoption' first and foremost, or else we'd never get everyone using it.. So there are many paradoxes involved and many people trying to solve them.\\n\\nI'd say the vast majority of members of this group either never even read the threads or rarely engage in them, or if they engage, it's just to shoot the sh*t, discuss things, and not solve problems.\\n\\nA good number of people I would call experts. Call them the household philosophers. They read through threads and either flip them around or reverse-engineer lines of thought, break down barriers and debunk myths, distortions, biases.. Together they maybe form the Conceptual Clearinghouse..\\n\\nMany are also invested in the funding\/sustainability\/gathering of resources part. Those people are rarely at the forefront. You won't see someone offering to fund a project on Facebook very often. There are a bunch of people not on Facebook involved with people that are on Facebook. Zaq Mosher has been going in that direction with the Colaboratori, leveraging networks on-the-ground etc. Some are just on Twitter also.. some have migrated to Google+.

An easy way of thinking of it derives from the math - you don't care about the asset you care about how much it changes in value. So for example an Option is a simple form of Derivative . .. lets say the stick is worth $500, and you are worried that it goes down. Then you buy the right to sell it for $500. If the stock goes up you sell it on the market, if the stock goes down you sell it to whichever Trader sold you that right.\\n\\nThat's the simple version, in practice it gets a LOT more complex, firstly - you probably don't sell the stock when it goes down, lets say the stock is now worth $450, then the Trader would just give you $50 (the difference between your price and the current value) and no stock changes hands. \\nSecondly - you might not actually own the stock, you might just buy the option - if the stock goes down in value you could buy the stock for $450 and sell for $500 so again the Trader pays you $50 and no stock changes hands.\\n\\nThis latter is why Derivatives get very hairy, because you can bet on stuff you don't own, and people make big bets where there is a large chance of a small gain, and a small chance of a big loss.

It's a mathematical glitch that will not allow for negative interest rates (called breaking the buck - most recently happened in the W administration).  Whereas in reality, productivity has an expiration date; crops rot, cars rust, people get old, etc.  Many have suggested that an expiring currency would incent quick investment in communities where social value is preserved rather than hoarding cash and placing bets that society will fail.   Yes, indeed actual productivity has become irrelevant.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"3320839\",\"name\":\"Erik M.C.

In so doing, they can \\\"free up\\\" money - but they dont create it  They are closer to insurance than anything else.  In your case of a bank, party a might write a \\\"put option\\\" derivative that allows party b to sell them $X shares in your bank for $3 million in 3 years (at party b's option).  This sort of a deal might make party b much more willing to invest $3m in your bank now (in exchange for shares) than they otherwise might have been.

In principle, as a multiplier in their reserves (eg 10X reserves).  Derivatives can be used to royally fuck with calculation of how much money a bank has actually created and, therefore, can make money really vaporous.\\n\\nSo, if party b is a *bank* then, yes.  They would loan you X, premised on your promise to pay them back X (plus interest in the future).  They can get a derivative contract from party A guaranteeing them payment of X in case you default.  Their risk of default, then is zero.  Combining your promise with the derivative contract, they have an *asset* that is worth X in the future.  This neatly balances out the loan that they are making to you today - so their books show a net zero.   But you get the loan and the money today.\\n\\nOf course this isnt how it would play out in reality.  Party A would charge for the derivative.

I'd like to understand the first 'Big Trade' more fully. What do you mean exactly by \\\"exchange of intellectual value for the value of carbon energy saved\\\". To me it sounds like this is what you are saying. Hypotheitcally speaking, say I am an enginner. I develop a car whose engine runs on a super mega powered air compressor powered by a ridiculously powerful and efficient network of photovoltaic cells.. something entirely out of science-fiction. It costs $1.50 USD to build the car. I sell it for whatever, say $150 USD. Also why not, to make it even more ridiculous, most of the outer surface of the car is made of some insane material I invented that eats up carbon emissions. Running the car for 1 hour is like erasing 1 year of industrial pollution.\\n\\nNow back to what you were saying, \\\"the exchange of intellectual value for the value of carbon energy saved\\\"... Is what I described an example of that? My 'intellectual value' went into the designing of this automobile.. and since my car is carbon-negative or whatever you would call that, then what??? I don't grasp the formula, I'm thinking of IP.. what do you mean exactly by 'intellectual value'? Are you saying that I would be getting paid in carbon credits for my hard work? something like that?\\n\\nAnyway I realize I'm not going to grasp all of this in one sitting.

They were ordered to take the plants and food to the dump and lay sod overtop of this most beautiful free community food garden, without warning, without a chance to remove the rare heirloom plant species or harvest the food. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe garden was planted by Occupy Gardens and allies on May 1st, in defense of local and global food security. While the garden has been growing undisturbed for nearly 5 months, with the help of hundreds in the community, the city deliberately decided to have it removed upon the eve of the Autumn Jam: A Harvest Party and celebration of sharing, community and free local food, which is happening tomorrow from 12-6pm at the garden in Queens Park (northwest section). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason? The people did not have permission to grow free food on public land. I come from a city and country where one does not need permission to do the right thing. We are experiencing a \\\"glocal\\\" food crisis, where more and more people are lining up at food banks for kraft dinner and peanut butter, waiting lists for community gardens are growing, food prices rising, and our leaders are nowhere to be seen. Rather they are hiding behind their desk ordering the workers to destroy whatever hope we have left. \\r\\n\\r\\nAgain we need help sharing this story far and wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be having our Autumn Jam harvest party\/vigil tomorrow as scheduled from 12noon-6pm in the northwest section of Queens Park. http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/414496608609039\/\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a side note - last Monday Sept 17th gardeners travelled to Ottawa on a Peas Keeping mission for national, global food security, where we planted a free heart-shaped food garden on Parliament Hill, at which point the RCMP stomped on the plants and threatened arresting people, we removed the plants and relayed the sod. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks so much for your time and help,\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Peas, Lovage & SOILidarity!\\r\\n\\r\\nJacob Kearey-Moreland\\r\\n647 379 2324\",\"properties\":[{\"name\":\"By\",\"text\":\"Occupy Gardens Toronto\",\"href\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/occupygardenstoronto?ref=stream\"}],\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/355168361237591\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/355168361237591\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"photo\",\"object_id\":\"523580454321991\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-28T18:42:42+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-28T18:42:42+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_355165834571177\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lisa Clapier\",\"id\":\"100000891407902\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"#KnowPhest.com, navigating earth\u2019s present shift to a higher level of consciousness, learning about what you didn't know you didn't know!

Your post resonated after I read this: \\n\\n\\\"If you're looking to explain how technocrats can possibly envision a world in which humans are only cogs in a machine, you've found the answer. These scientists refuse to admit that freedom is real. As bizarre as this sounds, it's true. To them we're all already cogs in a machine. They just want to change the arrangement, the configuration of parts.\\n \\nYou see, and this is where philosophy pokes its head into the fray, to say that freedom is real is to acknowledge that it lies beyond all formulations and theories of cause and effect. And such a confession would torpedo the authoritarian and privileged status of modern science.\\n \\nNo, you say, this couldn't be true, everybody knows that freedom exists. Everybody knows that you can choose A or B. You can make decisions about your future. I'm sorry to say, not everybody knows this---and the disturbing thing is, the people who are doing the most advanced research on the brain, the kind of research that could shape and fence in our future world, quite definitely do not know freedom exists.\\n \\nFreedom and \\\"mind independent of the brain\\\" are, to them, maddening little questions they want to get rid of. They want to sweep them under the carpet. They want to chart and map every possible action of the brain and then, inevitably, make those changes in it they deem proper \\\"for the the good of All.\\\"\\n \\nSo, first on the list of things I would recommend is, take inventory of your own experience. Remember moments when, beyond your normal level of daily consciousness, you experienced freedom directly and powerfully. No filters. No intellectual assumptions. Just undeniable encounters.\\n \\nWhy? Because you need to know what you are defending when you defend freedom against attack. Yes, freedom is the right to choose your life. Yes, it's the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. Yes, it's all those assertions in the Bill of Rights. Yes, the Constitution delineates what the central government can and can't do. Yes, we know that. But then there is YOU. There is your existence. There is your experience of freedom. Those times, those moments when you felt it so strongly you were thrilled to your core to be alive.\\n \\nThat is natural freedom. That is mind freedom. That is why the founding documents of the Republic have any meaning. They flow from something that is already there, in each one of us. A potential that is already there.\\n \\nAnd if you forget that, you defend freedom for an incomplete reason\\\"\\n\\nhttp:\/\/jonrappoport.wordpress.com\/2012\/09\/27\/mind-freedom-mind-beauty\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-27T21:38:38+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzU0ODY3NDU3OTM0MzQ4\",\"before\":\"MzU0ODY3NDU3OTM0MzQ4\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_354848454602915\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"id\":\"904115122\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"caption\":\"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/354848454602915\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/354848454602915\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-27T20:34:03+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-27T20:34:03+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_354764627944631\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\",\"id\":\"1482404646\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"La g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation des imprimantes 3D pourrait affecter profond\u00e9ment les modes de production pourraient en effet se r\u00e9percuter dans les structures industrielles.

In order to do this, it attempts to create a general grammar to ease the understanding of the varied phenomena that will be discussed in the rest of the report. It tries to uncover the fundamental drives and explains the basic interconnected concepts. It ends with a first approach to a categorization of the different expressions of the collaborative economy. Chapter Two looks at user innovation dynamics, and describes how the corporate world has answered their challenge. We examine the emerging figures of the more active 'user' which replaces the traditional figure of the consumer, and sociological categories such as the professional amateur and the lead user. The chapter describes how corporations have adapted by initializing open innovation and by integrating practices for co-design and co-creation of value in their own value chains. We also look at the more independent user-generated media practices, which have been facilitated with the emergence of social media. In Chapter Three we look at two of the new 'diagonal' or 'hybrid' approaches. These hybrids combine entrepreneurship with more horizontal participation, and deepen of the mutualization of both skills and materials. In the case of crowdsourcing, firms appeal to the crowd for both creative\/innovative input and for more service-oriented tasks; we try to make sense of this complex ecology. We also look at the emergence of collaborative consumption, in which physical resources and services are mutualized, in order to mobilize hitherto underutilized idle resources. Practices of mutualization characteristic to collaborative consumption also to render existing services more ecologically efficient, as for example in car sharing. We are witnessing here a more profound shift: from ownership to access: this is, access to a wide variety of services. We look at the new possibilities for (dis)intermediation that it generates, but also at the peer to peer marketplaces that it enables. In Chapter Four we look at the more radical community-centric production methods, i.e. the emergence of commons-based peer production, where participating firms have to adapt more stringently to the rules and norms of the initiating communities. After defining peer production, we look at the various ways in which community and corporate dynamics interpenetrate to create a 17dynamic field of hybrid economies. We also look at the cultural penetration of these new practices and the current shift of their reach from the more immaterial creation of knowledge and code, to actual physical production through the sharing of designs, as is emerging in the fields of open hardware and distributed manufacturing. In Chapter Five, we look at the infrastructural underpinnings which enable the new forms of distributed production. These range from the very material development of personal fabrication and 3D printing machines culminating in new possibilities for microfactories, but also distributed funding, new accounting and metric systems to measure distributed development, and new hybrid legal forms. These new hybrid legal forms integrate for-profit and non-profit motives, with more potential to generate contributing communities. Chapter Six is an overview of 'open' (i.e. based on shared intellectual property) and community-based business and monetization models. It answers the crucial question of financial sustainability in the absence of strong IP-based rent income.\\\"\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/p2pfoundation.net\/Synthetic_Overview_of_the_Collaborative_Economy\",\"name\":\"Synthetic Overview of the Collaborative Economy - P2P Foundation\",\"caption\":\"p2pfoundation.net\",\"description\":\"* Report: A Synthetic Overview of the Collaborative Economy.

Written\\nover 40 years ago by the future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, at the behest of the US Chamber of Commerce, the 6-page memo, a free-market\\nutopian treatise, called for a money fueled big business makeover of\\ngovernment through corporate control of the media, academia, the pulpit,\\narts and sciences and destruction of organized labor and consumer\\nprotection groups.\\n\\n\\\"Today, politics is the playground of the rich and powerful, with no\\nthought given to the hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans.

I am recalling work I did with a group in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Phoenix. They were a faith-based group, working out of a church ministry. And they were accomplishing things that would make you believe in their God if you didn't already.\\n\\nWhen we first spoke with the powerhouse who ran these social ventures, meeting in the church basement, with signs of poverty everywhere, we asked (among our other questions) \\\"What stops you? What - if anything - keeps you from accomplishing more?\\\"\\n\\nAnd the woman looked at me as if I had grown another eye. Finally she just said, \\\"Nothing stops us!\\\" And that was precisely correct. And in the decade since then, I've watched her pull together funding in amazing ways, but not because it was primary on her mind - because she was a powerful network weaver who engaged everyone she met in her work - and eventually that included people who could help with funding.\\n\\nI do get what you're saying, Greg - I really do. But what I have found is that it's a matter of coming from a scarcity mindset or a sufficiency mindset. When we focus on the money, we do dumb things in the name of getting funded - that's the scarcity talking.  And again, I'm in start-up myself right now, so I know those demons well - I think they're setting up permanent residence on my couch!\\n\\nBut when we step back and focus instead on engaging others to build the effort together, the money does really and truly take care of itself.\\n\\nIt's not magic or the power of attraction or other BS. It's just the practicalities of network weaving with the intent to create strong projects. And part of that network is people who can help with funding. When that engagement comes not from a place of \\\"finding funding\\\" but from a place of building strong efforts, the money shows up in places we never expected it. And bottom line, it's not as hard - it feels more joyful, because it's coming from a place of sufficiency and abundance and connectedness vs the scarcity of just seeking funds.\\n\\nSorry so long - no time to shorten it (sigh).

I'm picking up especially on the way that you, Jean, answered this. I want to share some backstory to this question, and then some forwardstory too!\\n\\nLast Tuesday night I went to see the movie Iron Sky with some friends, in which nazis who landed on the dark side of the moon in 1945 return to Earth in 2018 in spaceships and wreak havoc, and _________spoiler alert____________, the movie literally ends on the note of global nuclear holocaust. Making an amusing, but depressing, projection of how international political cooperation might look like in 6 years, it doesn't strike me as far from what's likely to exist. And while the majority of viewers surrounding me sat chuckling at scenes in this movie, their naive-feeling amusement only contributed to the wretched feeling in my gut as I witnessed human destructiveness at its pinnacle. As I often hear Jean Robertson saying, 'we are the weapons of mass destruction we have been looking for in places like Iraq.(and we are also the renewable energy sources we most need)'. And while multiple people have drawn weak links between certain modern world events with the possible feel of Nazi Germany late 1930's, there has been even more reason for me to be aware of nuclear threat, as through my web design work I helped build an informative website on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the closest we've ever come to nuclear holocaust. Now that the site is built, I myself am going to explore more content (it's at http:\/\/armageddonletters.com) and invite you to. I'm 21 years old. I now have a better appreciation for some of my friends who are content to spend their days drinking, because to observe the world as closely as I do with wide open eyes means acknowledging that in all likelihood the future is severely fucked up, even moreso than the present. But after a brief period of pure despair, I actually felt it transforming into resolution and a magnified sense of purpose. It had served as a reminder of *why I do what I do*. What do I do? Accelerate the emergence of a new human operating system (individual and collective) that does not include systemic tendencies for self-and-other-destructiveness of course. If I were to stray out on a limb I would say that something along those lines is why you're all here on the Next Edge. That's certainly my interpretation of what this is anyways lol. \\n\\nThat said, I added The Next Edge to a list I began to work on, late into the night, of all the groups I knew of that seemed to share my goal and demonstrate that visibly through their actions. Once I had my list (which I'm also going to share with you) I asked the question 'what specifically is it that all these things have in common that led to me putting them on my list?' Hence the question that I asked you all. \\n\\nThe Forwardstory\\nSo if these groups and individuals like myself really do have such lofty goals as this, how on Earth do we intend to accomplish them? I believe that the starting point of the answer to that question is a process, one that, as Lynne mentioned, I observed at the beginnings of this year happening in the Next Edge community and beyond, dancing around the term federation, but more broadly it is even just an awareness of, and loose connection to one another, possibly the cross-pollination and sharing of resources and experience, and just in general working together. I was so ramped up on the idea that I made these drawings of a platform to aid the process, apparently on February 10th: http:\/\/newhive.com\/connoropolous\/metamap-the-movement. After drafting up the list I did on Tuesday, I realized that I didn't have anywhere to share it in the way that I wanted to share it. But the 'metamap' drafts I had done would be the perfect place. So I spent all week programming the place for me to put my list, with the feeling that *it's time. It's not done yet, but I'm extremely anxious for it to be done so that I can share my list in a place that does it justice. There were lots of ways that a conversation that I had with Venessa Miemis during my time at Emerging Leader Labs was enlightening, one was understanding more about the 'federation' process that was happening earlier this year. One lesson, the process doesn't just happen on its own. The actions of each person, the participation or not of each person makes a difference. In particular at the time, it seemed like Venessa was a key catalyst in the process. My interpretation of my conversation with you, Venessa , and my observations about your circumstances, have witnessed an understandable 'backing off' of sorts from that process and that it's since gone semi-idle (though I believe it holds an important place on the radar of many people). So now I'm asking, how can I support this starting point process, so that we can get to higher order forms of co-creation? The imminent launch of this 'metamap'  I think may prove useful in a multitude of ways. Of course, as a crucial element I've made the code open source for faster open-innovation and hopefully it can be one piece of an ecosystem of custom tools used by such a crowd as us that more and more wants to get off facebook. \\n\\nTo keep up with the 'unintentional sectors' (read Public and Private) who don't seem to have interests in preserving our global commons and to simultaneously ensure that we aren't just replicating their dysfunctional systems and practices is an exercise in scaling self-organizing agile panarchic systems. It has never before been attempted on the scale that is needed, and it WILL NOT happen on its own. After making my list of groups, I attempted just for fun to estimate how many people there might be in this sector. Not including Occupy (because it is an outlier of sorts from the rest of my list) I can't imagine that the list includes more than 10 000 people. That may on the one hand, seem like a lot, but on the other hand, that's a very small fraction of 7 billion. \\n\\nIs it possible to create a sector membrane representing the movement of movements (meta-movement) towards some form of new human operating system? My best sense of how that inclusive membrane might work depends on two factors, someone including themself, and some mechanism for 'the group' also agreeing that they're included (consensus? meritocratically? polymorphically?). But that's getting ahead of myself. \\n\\nYou might be wondering at this point, how did a 21 year old get all these ideas? Truly, I have Jean Robertson and the Household-As-Ecology to thank, the best possible 'social incubator' I know of for generating this kind of deep wealth (sanity) that I feel like I'm connected to, and expressing to you today. The opportunity (over 2.5 years so far) for intergenerational learning, and the constant exposure to Jean's 70 years worth of evolutionary thinking have brought me where I am today. I think intentional household units like the Household-As-Ecology will be the basic building block for scaling this new sector. I'm excited to begin sharing with you all the learning that we've been doing together these last few years on the most elemental human challenge of living together.   \\nSo... let's get building.\\n\\nConnor Scott Turland\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"736739458\",\"name\":\"Jean\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":150,\"length\":4},{\"id\":\"776394301\",\"name\":\"Jean Robertson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":961,\"length\":14},{\"id\":\"630505808\",\"name\":\"Venessa Miemis\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":4141,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":true,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-23T19:36:02+0000\",\"like_count\":7,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"353432871411140\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Kellden\",\"id\":\"570407302\"},\"message\":\"Connor Scott Turland thanks for this gem of a comment.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"692010590\",\"name\":\"Connor Scott Turland\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":20}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-23T19:45:55+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":true},{\"id\":\"353873541367073\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Connor Scott Turland\",\"id\":\"692010590\"},\"message\":\"cc Seb Paquet I do hope you see my big comment above, I'd love for you to see it, and hate for you to miss it :)\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":3,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":true,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-25T02:46:04+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"353883404699420\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"that was pretty epic, Connor!

And as climate change begins to affect not just the poor but the wealthy as well, we will increasingly look for techno-fixes to turn down the temperature, with massive and unknowable risks \u2026 As the world warms, the reigning ideology that tells us it\u2019s everyone for themselves, that victims deserve their fate, and that we can master nature, will take us to a very cold place indeed.\\\"\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/billtotten.wordpress.com\/2012\/09\/24\/the-waning-of-the-modern-ages\/\",\"name\":\"The Waning of the Modern Ages\",\"caption\":\"billtotten.wordpress.com\",\"description\":\"Time to Abolish the American Dream by Morris Berman CounterPunch (September 20 2012) La longue duree  \u2013 the long run \u2013 was an expression made popular by the Annales School of French his...\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/353542074733553\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/353542074733553\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-24T03:14:58+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-25T00:29:59+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"529477472\",\"name\":\"Bruce Kunkel\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"},{\"id\":\"1422975257\",\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\"},{\"id\":\"516134310\",\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\"},{\"id\":\"578568173\",\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\"},{\"id\":\"100003991652107\",\"name\":\"Abhay Pattnaik\"},{\"id\":\"2230985\",\"name\":\"Mark Dilley\"},{\"id\":\"733480644\",\"name\":\"Steve Wright\"},{\"id\":\"583722931\",\"name\":\"Cristian Fleming\"},{\"id\":\"674516612\",\"name\":\"John F Powers\"},{\"id\":\"100003937500084\",\"name\":\"Jeff Aldrich\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTAwMDAzOTM3NTAwMDg0\",\"before\":\"NTI5NDc3NDcy\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"353561034731657\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\",\"id\":\"516134310\"},\"message\":\"Great article, and interesting timing... just last week someone sent me and many others a link to Naomi's 10-month-old post, the one that Morris is writing about here.

Trying to get 200 people to use a piece of software is extremely difficult. It's the same problem a software start-up has in the beginning, of getting users to adopt the software. Even after adoption, you'll need to get people to stick to using it.. many paradoxes arise.. part of it is a coordination problem, part of it is similar to the adoption of technical standards, specifications..\\n\\nThe problem in my book is one of changing people's habits, changing their behavior. They need to be persuaded to do so. That means they need to be sufficiently motivated to change habits, they need the ability to do the new behavior, and they need a trigger too. I call them network paradoxes and I see them everywhere in collaboration, orchestration, cooperation, coordination. It's as though there is a certain Activation Energy that is required, as in a chemical reaction, i.e. catalysis.. You need a catalyst to lower the potential barrier \/ activation energy.

We certainly need both push and pull and functioning examples of how to use technology appropriately, but I think too many bright minds are currently being diverted from scales of real change: the community or district scale.  It is here in which networks come alive and resilience is achieved.\\n\\nLiving in Scandinavia the past 2 years has opened my eyes to how district planning can be better approached... Copenhagen draws most of its energy from a local decentralized grid and is in a fantastic position to be carbon neutral by 2020... I also toured this town in Sweden called Vaxjo, which has been voted the Greenest city in Europe... interesting thing was that it looked EXACTLY like every other city in Sweden... only difference was how it managed energy and resources behind the scenes.  This type of work has a FAR bigger impact than a handful of innovative structures scattered about.. but again, both are important.\\n\\nI've also drawn a lot of inspiration from Project for Public Spaces exploration of Placemaking as a new environmentalism... this movement is about focusing on the community scale and the spaces BETWEEN buildings as the key leverage points for greater resilience.

Not a way to solve anything. And I would make sure I'd have the means to back up what I say. I'd need to have the capacity to forcefully remind ANY offender of this point. Negotiations yes, war (and threat of war) no. \\n\\n- institute a drive for government transparency at all levels. If the administration is doing it, the people can know about it. That would be the general principle. People employ governments. They need to know, as any employer would, what is being done in their name. \\n\\n- remove all barriers to technological progress, especially but not only in the energy production\/distribution area. This would include ending the era of fossil-fuel burning, including the use of uranium or other nuclear fuels that present known hazards to health and our future. \\n\\n- institute a monetary system that does not create money as a debt and that allows for the smooth exchange of any goods\/services as well as for productive investment. This would include decapitating the currently existing speculative money and commodity markets. The economy is a game of production, not of Monopoly. \\n\\n- oh yes, end all government-granted monopolies and government-enforced prohibitions. There should be no monopoly on any goods (such as salt, tobacco and pharmaceuticals) or services (such as telecommunications, education or medicine) or information. This would not be done by anti-trust legislation but by liberalizing the laws that hold monopolies in place or that allow them to form. The first prohibitions to end would be drugs, pornography and prostitution. \\n\\nThese would be my first five.\\n\\nI would then make sure that countries, no matter how small, are treated with respect and are given all the help possible to develop their own capacity to feed their people, to manufacture their own necessities, and to grow the intellectual capacities of their population. \\n\\nI would also end environmental destruction by requiring frugal and responsible use of resources, and technological developments that allow us to grow and live within the means of our biosphere. \\n\\nI would promote respect for ALL other life forms.\\n\\nAnd talking about other life forms... I would promote the development of real spacefaring capacity: Propulsion that does not need to carry fuel (no more rockets...) Energy production in a similar way. Anything needed to get us to the stars, including the ending of government suppression of information on the existence of and past human interactions with races\/civilizations from other star systems and galaxies. \\n\\nDon't judge me too hard on that last point - I know it's too far out for many to even entertain the thought...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-11T10:14:28+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"348977991856628\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"id\":\"1063904902\"},\"message\":\"Mega-like the big perspective.

It would be an exercise in increasingly conscious, competent and wise self-organization.  Through each success we would be working our way out of our leadership jobs, with leadership functions devolving to people and the systems they design well to guide them.\\n\\nA BIG-PICTURE EVOLUTIONARY RATIONALE\\n\\nEvolution continually adjusts the Fit of all interdependent, interacting entities, changing and disposing of those entities as needed for the Fit (\\\"survival of the Fit\\\").  Collective wisdom allows us to be conscious participants in sustaining the ongoing Fit, continually learning how to sustain ourselves by creatively and persistently supporting the life of all upon whom (and which) we depend.  I see this as the essence of conscious evolution and, to an intriguing degree, of Evolution becoming conscious of Itself.\\n\\nINITIATIVES\\n\\nBringing greater wisdom to the functioning of politics, economics, and technological development - the three systems whose functioning have the greatest impact on our evolutionary trajectory - would be my highest priority.  Other systems - from health care to transportation, from education to energy - are dependent on those primary three for their rules and character.  Among the primary changes I would seek in each of those are:\\n\\nPOLITICS - transparency; random selection; mini-public deliberations; crowdsourcing journalism; systems thinking; limiting the impact of money\\n\\nECONOMICS - internalizing social and eco-costs in prices; shift from centralized debt money towards sharing and gifting, from consumerism towards deeply satisfying our deepest needs, and from waste and toxics towards cycling lightly through the biosphere\\n\\nTECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT - focus on technologies that support the vectors noted above; actively impede technological support for power-over (e.g., for violence, war, surveillance, political manipulation, etc., even \\\"conquering disease\\\"); learn from nature; use the precautionary principle.  \\n\\nWe are nature's creativity on speed and unless we rein in our technological and economic power we will soon create the capacity for small groups or crazy individuals to destroy civilization, humanity and\/or much of the rest of life on earth, on purpose or by accident.  We need collective wisdom to design, guide, and enforce this \\\"reining in\\\".  Focusing on improving individual and community capacity and health - despite the compelling immediacy of these approaches - is not only insufficient to generate collective wisdom but, under many circumstances, can actually guide us into collective folly.  We must - at the very least - be guided by the original definition of sustainability:  the ability of we in current generations to meet our needs without undermining the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

I finally understand what David Holzmer writes about liminality and leadership. Liminality is the stage in a rite of passage when you're no longer what you used to be, but you haven't yet arrived at being something new.  It can be an uncomfortable place to be.  \\n\\nI've noticed that more than one client over the past few years, at similar points in the process, has started reacting violently against what I'm advising, as if it's something terribly threatening. I took their responses quite personally, because often they were intended that way. And I wondered why I had such a talent for choosing psycho clients.  Now, I see that they were terrified of losing control, of letting go of the devil they knew.  So they attacked the messenger.  This concept of liminality helps me see that it might help to warn clients in advance that that stage will be uncomfortable.

That continuum is not a descriptor of a person, but simply a descriptor of how they are experiencing the particular issue that is in front of them - so, for example, whatever you are there to talk about.\\n\\nDepending on where people are along that continuum, the message of what they are ready to hear, to resonate with them to move to the next stage along the continuum, is very different at each stage.  And so what will be the perfect message for one stage will be completely rejected out of hand for someone who is simply thinking at a different stage along that continuum.  \\n\\nSo for example, at one end are the folks who believe they just need one small, discreet thing and everything will be ok - if only they have that one thing.  Often it's funding, usually of the lottery variety (venture, foundation, etc.) From there, there is frustration, that they've tried the one thing, and it didn't solve all their problems, so now what? From there they are willing to put a toe in to try something different, then to dive in, then to practice that new thing till it's not new anymore, then etc.\\n\\nThe job of the consultant, then, is to be able to identify where people are along that continuum, to be able to meet them where they are, and create the conditions for them to feel comfortable reaching for the next stage in their potential.\\n\\nIt is a very different approach to consulting, and we have just begun teaching this to the consultants in Creating the Future's community, to incredible results.

The\\n> evidence presented in the film makes the best case yet for why genetically\\n> modified organisms (GMOs) are linked to disorders such as allergies,\\n> inflammatory bowel disease, infertility, autism, and cancer, to name a few.\\n> One health practitioner, Mary Tobin, L.Ac., said the film \u201cprovides\\n> abundant\\n> evidence that eating a GMO-free diet is the single most important change\\n> Americans can make for their health.\\n>\\n> That evidence not only includes doctors and patients testimonials, but also\\n> veterinarians and farmers who describe dramatic health improvements in\\n> animals that switched to non-GMO feed. The categories of diseases that\\n> improve in humans and animals are the ones found in lab animals fed GMOs.\\n> And these are many of the same categories, e.g. immune, reproductive, and\\n> gastrointestinal disorders that have been on the rise in the US population\\n> since GMOs were introduced.\\n>\\n> Exposing the Dark Side\\n>\\n> This 85 minute documentary reveals, what author John Robbins calls, \u201cthe\\n> bullying and deceit of the biotech industry,\u201d\u2014 including manipulation of\\n> research, attacks on independent scientists and their findings, and\\n> infiltration and control of government regulators.\\n>\\n> The film also reveals for the first time to horrific impact among workers\\n> on\\n> a South Africa farm, who were consuming a higher amount of GMO corn than\\n> probably any other group in the world.\\n>\\n> Upbeat, Empowering and World Changing\\n>\\n> Although this film\u2019s eye-opening evidence in the film is sometimes\\n> shocking,\\n> it is by no means a downer. According to Robbins, it \u201cshines a bright light\\n> of hope that we can reclaim our health and our food systems.\u201d Smith\\n> explains\\n> that as little as 5% of the US population switching to non-GMO foods should\\n> deliver a tipping point, inspiring food companies to kick out GM\\n> ingredients. It was such a consumer rejection that already kicked GMOs out\\n> of Europe.\\n>\\n> The film is being released right in the throes of the California campaign\\n> for Prop 37. If it passes in November, food companies will have to label\\n> products made with GM ingredients (like they do in nearly 50 other\\n> countries). Not only will this make it far easier for people to buy\\n> healthier non-GMO choices, the expected migration away from labeled GM\\n> products will probably accelerate the tipping point.\\n>\\n> Genetic Roulette\u2014The Gamble of Our Lives is a production of The Institute\\n> for Responsible Technology (IRT). Those who view the film during the free\\n> showing week are encouraged to support IRT\u2019s efforts, through donations, by\\n> subscribing to the Spilling the Beans free e-newsletter, and by joining\\n> with\\n> other citizen advocates through the Non-GMO Tipping Point Network\u2014to help\\n> get the word out in California and beyond.\\n>\\n> \u201cGENETIC ROULETTE unveils a world most of us have never seen.

I try to keep most of this to myself, but I have really reached bottom. I know most of you are extremely talented and smart, and I am hoping you can help me find some sollution. I am transsexual, which means I was born visibly in one gender (male) but I never felt I belonged in it. My whole life, I wanted dolls, to be in ballet, to get my ears pierced, to buy dresses, to be asked to prom by some nice guy. My parents left when I was 5 and I was raised in fostercare, bouncing from home to home, thru various abuses. At 18 I was released by the state, no education, no job, no skills, no family. I have been trying to find my way from that point. I am 30 now. Being transsexual is like being a statue, frozen, able to see the world but never affect it. Each day is one where my body rapes me. When I shower, or change my clothes, it's not something others can understand, it's painful and darkening. I transitioned three years ago and all my identification says female, but when I look into the mirror, I see my captor staring back at me. My children are 6, 5, and 2 and they go to the pool each day with my wife, they beg me to come with them, but I can not, I can not wear a bathing suit.  And the parents stare at me with anger in their eyes, I am an affront to the conservative muslim values of our complex, When I go to the doctor or the emergency room I am typically harassed. I was forced out of my job as a waitress on a military base after coming out as trans. I fought for two years thru 3 equal opportunity complaints to save my job. I can still remember one shift, when an officer looked straight at me and said \\\"it puts the lotion on it's skin\\\" with cruel mocking in his eyes, he kept repeating it until I ran from the room, and left my shift. I just want to be able to walk down the street without being attacked or yelled at, I want to take my children to a play group without other parents corralling their children away from mine as if my condition might affect them. The surgery I need is called SRS and FFS (Sexual Reassignment Surgery and Facial Feminization Surgery) Our insurance, Tricare, specifically lists transsexual care as excluded from coverage. the surgeries run from 20,000 to 50,000 dollars. If anyone know anyway I can get this surgery, it would make all the difference in life. I appreciate any help or suggestions that may come.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/350621585025602\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/350621585025602\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-15T18:36:52+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-16T17:24:12+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"1356175903\",\"name\":\"Inara Yafa Tabir\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTM1NjE3NTkwMw==\",\"before\":\"NjUyNTAzMTY4\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"350655185022242\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Inara Yafa Tabir\",\"id\":\"1356175903\"},\"message\":\"If anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-15T20:39:10+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"350699985017762\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Floris Koot\",\"id\":\"536626881\"},\"message\":\"A painful story.

It's why if you had every comment I ever posted on Facebook in one file and read them all, you wouldn't find much that could actually be profitable. I engaged in discussions, but almost never shared any actual new theories or ideas. That's part of what I keep talking about, you won't find much online of my actual work. You will find tens of thousands of pages with my \\\"content\\\", but since the 1990s I've tried my hardest to make all original content at least somewhat ambiguous and incomplete, my biggest priority being to make my ideas and my work as unusable by others as possible. The real work is not connected to the internet or even in digital format. If I died tomorrow, it would belong to my succession. Oh wait that's starting to sound like a trade secret! EYES ONLY! haha :)\\n\\nThere were a few slip-ups along the way, I did talk about one project and I've regretted it ever since, though it happened to be something no one seems to be interested in producing in any case. It was only a general description of the underlying concept and made no mention of the scaffolding, architectural design, etc. The other mistake is that some of my music and paintings are accessible online.. it was a tough decision, one that I've also regretted ever since. If I could go back in time, I probably would refrain from ever even using the WWW or connecting to the Internet. It's an extremist position, but my life was much better before I started using digital media \/ digital technology.\\n\\nIn any case, I'm happy Harlan T Wood that I'm not alone in being concerned about this. Sometimes you have to get a notice for copyright infringement on your own intellectual property to wake up and smell the bacon. Not because there was infringing content in your content, but because somehow you don't seem to own the rights to your own property anymore, so you are infringing on the rights of the true rightsholder, except that you are the sole author of the work. Wait till you see people selling your documents on Amazon, too. That will scare the sh*t out of you.\\n\\nSorry for the long, boring story, but I've been painting since I was 4 years old. I've had works stolen, worked lost, works willfully destroyed or vandalized, and that's not even a fraction of the troubles I've had with intellectual property. Not to mention that in 30+ years, it hasn't exactly been all that profitable a business for me, which is why I'm basically, reluctantly abandoning the career. It's an extreme act of protest. Protest against the market, protest against government intervention in the market, in arts & culture, protest against the free-rider problem, protest against art theft, infringement, falsification.. and finally an act of protest against those who think images or ideas belong to everybody inclusively. Pinterest was the frosting on the cake for me as a visual artist. I joined and was Pin-o-maniacal like everyone else, until I realized that ethically, morally I couldn't bring myself to use the service. As a visual artist, I couldn't promote or condone such activities. I protest against people who want to hack culture and think culture is a fundamentally human phenomenon and so naturally belongs to everyone inclusively. Culture cannot exist without cultural artifacts. Think about that. The artifacts don't just grow on trees or fall from the sky, or brought into existence by divine decree. Someone has to build it, make it, assemble it, construct it, put it together, shape it, mold it, erect it, create it, craft it, form it, design it, string it together, originate it, and so on.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"604081563\",\"name\":\"Harlan T Wood\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1571,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-13T19:46:36+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"349844621769965\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Sepp Hasslberger\",\"id\":\"596978687\"},\"message\":\"Have you guys ever heard of public domain?

That is the whole point. That is, that's the spirit in which the first copyright\/patent laws were drawn up. It is meant to, in my own words here, create a very rich pool of knowledge, of cultural artifacts, of inventions, ideas, etc. that all people can access and enjoy.. The public domain in my view is fundamental. Inventors need access to the inventions of past inventors, just like scientists need access to the work of past scientists, and so on, the same for the arts, design, etc. (never mind certain restrictions for now).\\n\\nThat's the \\\"first principle\\\", if I can call it that. The second principle is to, again in my own words, give artists, inventors, etc., a) the ability to profit from his\/her enterprise, and consequently b) giving them an incentive to innovate.. I personally think a) the original spirit has long been forgotten and b) the system has been abused, ex. patent trolls etc. and c) we should revise the process by which things enter into the public domain. The goal is for there to be that very rich public domain that everyone can profit from. As far as I'm concerned, I want to profit from my labors now. When I'm dead, I won't be able to profit, and if I did profit, and was given an incentive to innovate and profit from my innovations, then my successors shouldn't have to worry about monopolizing my work.. Once I'm gone, the least I can do is offer my good works to the public.. In some cases, I would do it long before that, using a Creative Commons license etc.\\n\\nAnyway in my case, as a painter, I have more important worries than those of intellectual property rights at the moment. We have a store similar to Wal-Mart, but smaller, called Giant Tiger. The other day I saw an original painting, on canvas, with actual paint, not a print. There was a whole series. They were 36 x 36 inches, selling for $29.97. You know what my starting price would be for the same painting? I'm a professional painter, but I'm still considered a \\\"beginner\\\" if you will, because legally, officially, I've only been a professional painter for 10-15 years, though I have painted my whole life. Anyway I still charge close to my original starting price for whatever reasons. For a 36 x 36 inch canvas, I wouldn't do anything under $2500.00 and that is dirt cheap in my book. That's $2 per square inch, where $6 is much more common and that's not including the frame. Who in their right mind would pay that price when they can get great art for $30 at Wal-Mart or similar stores? Ok, say I am more talented than the Wal-Mart artists, or more renowned. The second problem is you have self-proclaimed \\\"professional\\\" artists selling the same stuff but grossly underpriced. I've seen paintings of similar formats go for $100-250. That's ridiculous, and that screws up the market for everybody involved.\\n\\nAnyway, I could price it differently. Say it took me 40 hours to finish the 36 x 36 in painting. Minimum wage in Qu\u00e9bec is close to $10. That means I could give myself a minimum wage and sell you the painting for $400. With the other pricing, I'd make something like $62 dollars an hour. The problem is, I've had paintings that took 15 minutes to finish and others that took 10 years to finish. The logic falls apart internally.\\n\\nWho do I think I am giving myself double the salary of a Truck Driver, or Bricklayer, or Carpenter, Plumber, Electrician? It must be hubris! or maybe I'm crazy or something.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, I need a few things to weigh in my favor to make a living-wage or at least break even. The whole copyright\/public domain thing is linked to many other factors, like the state of the market, the \\\"health\\\" if you will of the market. I can't give my paintings away or work for nothing and I need anything that can help turn the scales in my favor, intellectual property rights being a potential source of income. Otherwise, if artists, inventors, so-called \\\"creatives\\\" don't have any incentive to invent or innovate, then they won't bother doing it, and economic growth may just suffer a shock treatment.\\n\\nBy the way, the same thing is happening in other domains. Think of people graduating from University with PhDs or whatnot, in debt up to their eyebrows, and who are fortunate if they get to go work at McDonalds or Burger King maybe even part-time. People are not going to want to get an education, are they? What happens then when you have no trained laborers, no tradespeople, etc.?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-13T21:23:49+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"349920321762395\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Harlan T Wood\",\"id\":\"604081563\"},\"message\":\"The new-ish CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license is a great way to dedicate your own works to the public domain.  http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/choose\/zero\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-14T00:27:08+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"350056058415488\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Sepp Hasslberger\",\"id\":\"596978687\"},\"message\":\"Alex - I can't really say much about your discussion of copyright\/patents.

I say this because I don't want to mislead you. I will have to do a little research to make sure I'm getting it right. With regard to the painting and selling it, intellectual property law actually is involved. It's easier if you think of a book. I purchase a book. I \\\"own\\\" the book, but if it is copyrighted, i.e. All Rights Reserved, I can't scan it, I can't upload it, I can't distribute it via the Internet or via any other means, no part can be reproduced, stored in or introduced into a retrieval system, or transmitted, in any form, or by any means, etc. You know the drill. You bought the book, not the rights to it.\\n\\nIt's pretty much the same thing for paintings. The laws are there to protect my property. That protection, in my opinion, is there to ensure the \\\"scales are tipped in my favor\\\", that is, unless I transfer the rights or whatnot, I should be the one to profit from my work. When you purchase one of my paintings, you down the artifact, not the rights to it. Does that make sense?\\n\\nAnother thing is what I call \\\"access control\\\" though there's probably a better term for it. To me part of the reason for limiting what people can do with a book they have purchased is not merely \\\"infringement for the sake of infringement\\\". As the author, I have the right to decide when and where my work is accessible. I control who reads it and in what context. Obviously, I can't sue you for hanging my painting in the closet or not hanging it at all. But you can't modify it, you can't vandalize it, even though it's your possession. You can't circulate a digital image of it online either. (*Note: I need to verify these claims just to make sure, the laws are not the same everywhere, for all intents and purposes I'm speaking about Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, and need to make sure I'm not misleading anyone).\\n\\nEvidently, there are simple solutions to these problems, contracts, agreements, licenses, and whatnot. If I wanted, when I sold you the painting, I could waive all rights, transfer them to you, etc. Again, the laws prevent others from profitting from my work. That doesn't mean that I myself will profit, nothing can ensure that I profit, that's up to the market to decide. But in that market, there is an asymmetry, an asymmetry of \\\"power\\\" if you will, over my work. It's similar in some ways when you buy an iPhone. You can't reverse engineer it, you probably can't take it apart etc. It's your \\\"property\\\" in the sense that you can use it to your heart's content or drop it in the toilet if you really want to.\\n\\nIf I paint a copy of the work of Old Masters, I can't just sign it with my name, it has to say something like \\\"after Pablo Ruiz Picasso\\\". When I sell a painting, I give the buyer a certificate of authenticity. I have constraints too, as an artist. I can't paint a portrait of Mickey Mouse or Nemo. Though I have done it before, I can't paint a frame from a movie, either. In most cases, though I also have done this, I can't paint a copy of a photograph. I do it anyway merely to practise my craft, but I would never show these works in public or try to sell them. I usually paint over them in time. (Personal study and development falls within fair use). The purchaser does have the right to have a unique image, so if I sell a print, say, from a 'limited edition', I can't produce more prints than the number originally stipulated..\\n\\nAnyway as you can see it's quite complicated. I was lucky in many ways because my father was a renowned artist. I learned the rules early on in life. But to answer your question, the laws didn't make me create my work, they just made a playing field where I can play a fair game. I see the protection of my rights as part of the incentive I have in creating works in the first place. If there were no laws, I might not want to risk creating original works.\\n\\nAnd there are \\\"laws\\\" if you will that allow me to sell my work. In Qu\u00e9bec, at any rate, I had to become a \\\"professional painter\\\" first. There are a few ways to attain that official \\\"status\\\", mine was being recognized by my peers by exhibiting my work alongside the work of \\\"professional painters\\\" recognized by their peers, and so on. It was in a museum and wasn't a free lunch, my work was selected by a panel of judges. Also having had solo exhibits over the course of at least 5 years, I think, helped give me that status. This might sound like a useless thing, to get an official \\\"label\\\", but it's very important to keep the market in check. Right now in Qu\u00e9bec thousands if not tens of thousands of people make paintings and call themselves \\\"painters\\\" or \\\"artists\\\" (we say \\\"artiste-peintre\\\" here), when in fact, few of them actually are professional painters. Their works are grossly underpriced, and they often don't respect the \\\"rules of engagement\\\", so it messes up the market for the professionals like myself.\\n\\nDo the laws need revision? I think so. Laws in general, in my opinion, should always be made to fit with the current reality. It goes without saying that things have changed since the birth of the WWW, and things changed even more with the proliferation of mobile devices. The laws should be revised to fit this new reality. With the whole mp3\/digital music scandal, the right thing to do is not to have the record labels et al sue individuals for millions of dollars. That to me is not right, even if the individuals are guilty of infringement. It's different if someone is copying CDs or DVDs and selling them, but we already have laws against that.\\n\\nI can't sell forgeries of Louis Vuitton bags, for instance, and that has little to do with digital media. The proliferation of the means to do so, though, is part of the very nature of digital media, that files can be copied etc. and easily distributed, and I don't think P2P file sharing in and of itself should be a criminal offense. We need to take a fresh look at these things, I think, and adjust the laws accordingly. Sueing an individual for millions of dollars for sharing files with their friends, is disproportionate to the actual offense.\\n\\nI say that disruptive technology sucks for some people in some cases. It's the name of the game. The disruptive technology is what caused record companies to lose money, and are the people who used the technology  to blame for this?\\n\\nIt happened overnight and in a swarm. How do you prosecute swarm behavior? Very few people saw mp3 files for the first time and said, \\\"I'm going to use this to screw over the record companies!\\\" I would say that everything before now was fair use, just state in the law that everything that happened before September 14th, 2012 was fair use, then after that you adjust the laws, make those changes known to the population, and then you can prosecute and sue etc. all you want, because the laws are clear and everyone has read them.\\n\\n(*Sorry for my cirumlocution.

I don't think it's wrong to share either, and honestly a lot of the time the darn laws make it impossible for me to do my own work. an example where fair use doesn't even exist anymore. I studied sound design in the 1990s and we were taught sampling. Sampling has been an integral part of my ambient sound design work for the last 15 years. But I can post my work on Youtube if there are samples, even a 1 second sample will set off the alarm and I will get what amount to threats from Youtube. I had a 1 second sample of the Cookie Monster and got a notice. The funny thing is, I could reproduce the Cookie Monster voice to a tee and get away with it, but using an actual recording is impossible now. I can't even record a video of myself if the radio is on in the room, or the television or any other medium. I'm not profitting from my Youtube channel.\\n\\nIf you ask me, that is very wrong. I am totally remixing it, it is in a totally different context, I used a negligible fragment of the original work, in fact, except for the Cookie Monster bit, you would never recognize the original work from my production. You couldn't even extrapolate it unless you had the audio signature in a database and scanned my soundscape to find a match for the signature. So now it's an algorithm that decides what is fair use and what isn't, and I find that very scary. What is next, algorithms that convict me, algorithms that are judge, jury and executioner? I've had notices on other sites too all provided by those faithful algorithms. Sorry but the law cannot be in the hands of computers.. I still want humans to decide.\\n\\nI think we are in agreement on a few things. The case of mechanical reproduction is an interesting one, and quite complex. As I said earlier, I think it has to do with the nature of digital technology. I used to be able to make photocopies of a book at the library. I remember there was a sign above the copying machine explaining what we could or couldn't do. I knew that if I kept it at a strict minimum, it was \\\"okay\\\", at least I didn't risk getting in any trouble. Plus everyone was doing it, which is another story altogether (what happens when the majority of a population continuously breaks a law, isn't that tantamount to a kind of citizen initiative, couldn't there be referendum if the vast majority of people don't observe or respect the law? Maybe the law is obsolete and should be eradicated?)\\n\\nMy point is that digital technology complicates things. Now if I scan the pages of a book, by virtue of the fact, I am storing it in a file system. I am digitizing it, storing it in a file system, and if I email you a picture of the Table of Contents of a new book I bought, I am sending it over a network, you are viewing it in a browser, it gets too complicated too fast. Your email service is storing it in a database on a server.. I think we might agree that the laws have not been properly updated or made current, and that they are being used in a way that was not the original intended purpose. This is in itself extremely worrisome for me, laws being applied for purposes other than their intended purpose. That's like a military organization engaging in activities that were not its intended purpose, like going rogue and causing havoc, just cause \\\"Hey we got the red light once for this one thing, that means we have the red light to do these other unrelated things we weren't intended to do...\\\" I am pushing it into the absurd on purpose. I think it is a general problem though with laws. I have nothing against the American Constitution or that people in America would want to uphold it, but I think often it's forgotten what the context was in which it was written. If a people or a nation cannot change its laws or its constitutions, or bills of rights, etc., to \\\"fit\\\" the times, then I think it is in some danger.. not sure what the danger is exactly, but they are human laws made up by humans for unique purposes.. and as they say, times change and people change with them.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-14T16:41:03+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"350195148401579\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Sepp Hasslberger\",\"id\":\"596978687\"},\"message\":\"The problem is that after some time we tend to forget the original intent of a law and of course that the industries that tend to profit from this are much more active than we are about pushing their point of view with the lawmakers who, like we, also forgot or never learned about the basics...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-14T16:55:42+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"350239278397166\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Merely as a reference and not to debate religious matters, one of the most marking things I ever read in my theological studies was a phrase by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, in The Imitation of Christ.

Representation of civil society in politics. \\nb. Transfer of power from states and markets to civil society. \\nc. Renewal of democracy by placing citizens and civil society at the centre. \\n\\nOur International Coordinating Council is at: http:\/\/www.civilsociety.org.au\/CivilSocietyPolitics2.htm \\n\\nCivil Society Politics \u2013 Power to the People is: \\n\\na. A movement - which individuals may join. \\nb. Global in scope - civil society is global, and a new political movement is needed in every country. \\nc. Open to members of existing parties and members of none, including those who seek new parties based on civil society politics. \\n\\nOur aim is to enable members in each country to network with each other and take initiatives as they see fit (including those who are members of the same political party, those who seek to form a new party or undertake electoral activity based on civil society politics). \\n\\nCivil Society Politics has 3 major advantages over other political change movements: \\n\\n1. It accepts the globalisation of culture, trade and people and aims to empower people and localities within it. It does not strive to build barriers of protection and isolation. \\n\\n2. It accepts a market economy with limited government and aims to empower civil society as the primary generator of cohesion, belonging, capital, ownership of assets, and public decision-making. \\n\\n3. In its focus on capturing power not for its own sake but for civil society, it has a built-in safeguard against extremism and the abuse of centralised power. \\n\\nOur International Council is developing several global initiatives to build this agenda. \\n\\nOur statement of purpose is at: http:\/\/www.civilsociety.org.au\/CivilSocietyPolitics.htm \\n\\nIndividuals and groups in every country are invited to participate in Civil Society Politics - Power to the People.

The difference being that the community creates efficiencies that increase the value of an asset rather than just sharing the asset between them.

Like always, I appreciate your constructive criticism.  \\nI just think \\\"instituted power relations\\\" are losing their role in organizing humans for creation and production. If what you call a  \\\"corporation\\\" is the thing that contains humans maintaining, among other relations, power-based relations, of the type boss-employee, I think that's outdated... These are *systems of confinement*. What we see emerging as the glue that holds people together around common projects\/goals\/endeavors are value-based relations. These are *attractive systems*. \\nHere's how I explain this: there is a relationship between information and instituted power relations. In a world deprived of effective and efficient means of communication and coordination, social structures with a mass far above Dunber's number and spread geographically MUST become centralized (institute relations of power) in order to introduce accountability, which allow formation of reliable pathways of information, efficient command and control mechanisms, which in turn are needed to insure the cohesion of that social system, and its ability to rapidly respond to environmental pressures. The same phenomena of centralization is also observed in complex organisms. The reason why we have a central nervous system is that individual cells can't exchange information p2p, they can only process information available within their small vicinity, one cell in my finger \\\"doesn't know\\\" what a cell in the other finger is doing.  p2p communication leads to p2p coordination, and the cohesion of large groups of individuals becomes possible without instituted power relations.  \\nThis is why I don't believe in corporations anymore. It's not just a moral issue in my case. The core mechanism that holds them together is still valid. But there is another mechanism that can insure cohesion to much larger scales now. Organizations built on power-based relations, systems of confinement, are now in direct competition with  organizations built on value-based relations, attractive systems. \\nPLACE YOUR BETS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! \\npower-based relations OR value-based relations?\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"578568173\",\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-11T05:39:51+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzQ4ODY5MTU4NTM0MTc4\",\"before\":\"MzQ4MzQzODMxOTIwMDQ0\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_348863038534790\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jeff Aldrich\",\"id\":\"100003937500084\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"How many of you who are U.S Citizens have received the \\\"American Community Survey\\\"?

The DM was sort of like an author who had complete control over his world.  The rules were guidelines to help generate a sense of objectivity and inter-subjectivity to the story.  As a player, you knew that good old random chance always played a role in the story and that you could enormously control your experience (by virtue of controlling your character).  There was (as a consequence) a huge emphasis on narrative and \\\"role playing\\\" (i.e., acting).  To be sure the acting was generally pretty poor, but the idea was that people should really be \\\"playing along\\\" and allowing the dice and the rules to form the scaffolding to make the game seem more 'realistic'.  DMs always crafted house rules and \\\"minmaxing\\\" was a vague concept.  \\n\\nNow DnD feels just like Magic the Gathering.  It is a real time strategy game - more akin to Command and Conquer or Starcraft II than theatre or fantasy writing.  To be sure there is plenty of old school - but the fundamental feel of the game is different.  Hence the rise of Pathfinder (or the retro push to just use version 1 rules - which rocks by the way).  Now ... why?  \\n\\nBut of course we can talk about the natural evolution of an entertainment product going through its optimization and competitive dynamics during the huge macro technical changes to the cultural niche during its lifecycle - the geek epochal 1970 - 2012.  The customer transformed enormously during that arc.  From largely ex-military troglodytes (said with all affection) to Norwegian Ministers and (most specifically for 4e) World of Warcraft players.  But the real meat of the matter is in the heads of the players themselves - the cognitive changes that lead them to be attracted to the form of rules - at least enough that the designers (and marketers) believe that these new rules will drive better sales than the older versions . . . \\n\\nI suspect that it has something to do with the strikingly regimented, over tested, over structured lives that were characteristic of the present target market (Gen Y males).

The asset of \u201cP2P\u201d systems is the person (not the system, model, software, knowledge. Therefore, to catalyze \u201cP2P\u201d systems, the focus of investment is most effective when directed towards improving the conditions of each person. Systems, models, theories are only really important insomuch as they further the fundamental goal of improving conditions of participants.\\n\\nWe are decidedly not all \u201cPeers\u201d: we do not all share an even playing field.\\\"\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-07T04:13:22+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzQ3NDY2Mzk1MzQxMTIx\",\"before\":\"MzQ3NDYyNzEyMDA4MTU2\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_347272255360535\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"id\":\"739008859\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"id\":\"528245547\"},{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"I have been playing with the relationships of flow\/stock and nurturing\/exploiting, and how we could probably express intentionality and goals of processes both in our discussions (leading to building The Platform and in the analysis and solutioning of our crisis at hand in terms of:\\n\\nNurturing the flow > To generate possibilities\\nExploiting the flow > To harvest possibilities\\nNurturing the stock > To grow potential\\nExploiting the stock > To realize the potential > to nurture the flow\\n\\nOur current system exploits the flow without nurturing it, and nurtures the stock without exploiting it, creating situations where flow (life blood etc, etc, etc...) is depleted and idle resources accumulated, diverted from generating possibilities. \\n\\nWhat Michel Bauwens describes as the artificial abundance of material resources and the artificial scarcity  of cultural and knowledge resources.\\n\\nWhat other narrative could this help formulate?\",\"message_tags\":{\"747\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":747,\"length\":14}]},\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347272255360535\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347272255360535\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-06T15:56:14+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-07T03:22:14+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\"},{\"id\":\"529477472\",\"name\":\"Bruce Kunkel\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"1061964254\",\"name\":\"Gunasekar C Rajaratnam\"},{\"id\":\"3904175\",\"name\":\"Jeff Vander Clute\"},{\"id\":\"100002424772880\",\"name\":\"Kyle Sykes\"},{\"id\":\"690601511\",\"name\":\"Paul Codd MacDonald\"},{\"id\":\"660337950\",\"name\":\"Lynne Desilva-johnson\"},{\"id\":\"1108906794\",\"name\":\"Markus Ananda Ode\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NTcwNDA3MzAy\",\"before\":\"NTI4MjQ1NTQ3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"347272832027144\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Kellden\",\"id\":\"570407302\"},\"message\":\"This is important, thanks much for sharing Helene Finidori I need to think about this a bit more, eg how it relates to groupflow and flow of wisdom...\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":43,\"length\":15}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-06T15:58:24+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"347275638693530\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lynne Desilva-johnson\",\"id\":\"660337950\"},\"message\":\"Helene I would like to engage this with a conversation about density, redundancy, efficiency, and aggregation vs. disparate spread --  I think it's interesting to think about it visually using different systems models for growth -- including, particularly designed agriculture vs. permaculture vs. wildgarten models -- when do we deplete and overharvest  -- when are we overscattering and\/or creating cycles of overgrowth that then rots, unusable and discarded -- wonder what our farming people have to say on that...?

These islands of elitism are designed to be largely self-sufficient in their ability to deliver health care, food, security, education, entertainment, etc. to their residents, even as they sit amid seas of social misery. (Mike Davis has spent a good portion of his career chronicling this sort of thing, starting in Los Angeles with City of Quartz, and examining it as a global phenomenon in collections like Dead Cities and Evil Paradises.)  From the point of view of the denizens of such communities, the primary function of the wider society is to serve as a source of cheap, servile labor, and as a well of resources to be looted. Gated communities, in turn, are merely an example of a broader pattern, in which economic, social, or political enclaves are carved out of a national state and enabled to play by a fundamentally different set of rules from the surrounding territory.\\n\\nIn themselves the creation of such enclaves do not amount to a plutocratic insurgency. Rather, plutocratic insurgency arises wherever you see financial and economic elites using such enclaves as staging areas for making war on public goods. This is what I take to be the defining political-economic feature of plutocratic insurgency: the attempt on the part of the rich to defund the provisioning of public goods, in order to defang a state which they see as a threat to their prerogatives. (Conceptually, plutocratic insurgencies thus need to be separated from kleptocracies\u2014the latter involve the using the institutions of state to loot the population, whereas the former wish to neutralize those institutions in order to facilitate private sector looting. In practice these may overlap or co-mingle.)\\\"\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/smallprecautions.blogspot.com\/2012\/09\/plutocratic-insurgency.html\",\"name\":\"Small Precautions: Plutocratic Insurgency\",\"caption\":\"smallprecautions.blogspot.com\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347166652037762\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347166652037762\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-06T08:27:33+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-07T02:55:49+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\"},{\"id\":\"587572171\",\"name\":\"Kevin Jones\"},{\"id\":\"660337950\",\"name\":\"Lynne Desilva-johnson\"},{\"id\":\"100003991652107\",\"name\":\"Abhay Pattnaik\"},{\"id\":\"828553957\",\"name\":\"PJ Manney\"},{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\"},{\"id\":\"555393473\",\"name\":\"Carmen Medina\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"},{\"id\":\"100001082978703\",\"name\":\"Clay Forsberg\"},{\"id\":\"1437664314\",\"name\":\"Joris Claeys\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NTcwNDA3MzAy\",\"before\":\"NTI4MjQ1NTQ3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"347168225370938\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Kellden\",\"id\":\"570407302\"},\"message\":\"Yes, I've been following this.

We non-Americans watch entranced and disgusted by the search for shadows that are bound to lurk in the hearts of Presidential opponents, as they do in each of us. Hubris takes no prisoners as it fractures into partisan flags flying from solitary peaks. There must be no spaces in between, no middle ground in American democracy today. Being forsaken isn\u2019t pretty.\\n\\nThe early settlers weren\u2019t blown here on gusts of hope. They were more pragmatic and desperate. Cradled in the riches of North America their nightmares gave way with opportunity, cooperation, and hard work. You could be unrealistic in America and still make something of your dreams. Somehow over two centuries such bounty got confused with hope and hope got confused with destiny. \\n\\nYou can\u2019t be forever blest. Such certainty is bound to scorch, first in the lengthening shadow you cast and eventually in the heart that holds it. This is really what\u2019s on display in American politics today - one last speculation on hope. But that will pass. Hope has evaporated from other peoples. From them Americans will discover more fundamental aspects of their character - courage, love, humility, resilience, reciprocity, trust, perseverance and yes, faith. \\n\\nHope isn\u2019t audacious. Courage is. Without it no other virtue is possible. It takes courage to confront your contradictions and wrong doings; to love opponents; to be curious about strangers; and to carry on even when driven to your knees.\\n\\nEmily Dickinson used a bird metaphor to define hope as \u201cthe thing with feathers that perches in the soul.\u201d But redemption does not have wings. Feathers are too light for the work ahead. The outlook may be bleak but many Americans are awakening to life in the spaces in between. They are not waiting as Emily Dickinson did for hope \u201cto sing the tune.\u201d They are rediscovering their faith in each other. These include truth-tellers like Angeles Arrien who nourishes with ancient wisdom, John McKnight and Peter Block who illuminate with neighbourly love and Bill Drayton who inspires a marriage between creativity and empathy. \\n\\nAmericans have long working days ahead. Those of us who love them should remind them they are not alone.\\\"\\n\\nhttp:\/\/www.aletmanski.com\/al-etmanski\/\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347379665349794\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/347379665349794\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-09-06T21:58:45+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-09-06T21:58:45+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"100002424772880\",\"name\":\"Kyle Sykes\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"},{\"id\":\"529477472\",\"name\":\"Bruce Kunkel\"},{\"id\":\"1138089017\",\"name\":\"Daryl Taylor\"},{\"id\":\"674516612\",\"name\":\"John F Powers\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"Njc0NTE2NjEy\",\"before\":\"MTAwMDAyNDI0NzcyODgw\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_347141198706974\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Kellden\",\"id\":\"570407302\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Emergent folksonomy of: NextEdge, SoCap, MetaCog, AppreciativeInquiry, presente!, P2P, The Open Mindset Group - a near invaluable transdisciplinary, transition enabling 21st C gathering of concerned human beings. \\n\\nOne of my concerns, is that some of the platforms we're gathering on, using, are a poor fit for leveraging the value of the folksonomy, for building further, for collaborating.

I was fortunate to develop a business where I could work out of the house, I was a headhunter. This gave me ample time to spend time with Alex. When I mean \\\"parental involvement,\\\" I mean teach your children how to think critically, how to look at everything from multiple perspectives and how to empathize. In my mind, creativity is feeling free to think for yourself and not be restricted by the fear of others opinions.

But we're still a work in progress. It's funny that PSTV(Paradigm shift TV) here in the UK sometimes gets mixed up with Sony Playstation TV. It would great if this video went viral and in a sense we are promoting a new game but one that's played out in reality. Another video will come out on PSTV for broadcast in the UK in a couple of months which will give an introduction and overview of the Fractal Brain theory. I'll also be making segmented YouTube videos. At the moment it's public talks and honing\/evolving my presentation, I'll be doing a few in couple of weeks and if I get a good video capture I put it up. Funny, my current audience is squatters, occupy protesters, a lot of young people and assorted deviants, but often highly intelligent. I believe this theory, and way of looking at the brain behind it, is what the worlds of Brain Science and AI have been waiting for. I know Kurzweil talks about the fractal brain but he can't show how this is the case as far as I know. He'll be a great fan of it I predict. At the very least the theory provides a complete fractal decompositioning of the brain. But the Theory also goes much further and has some interesting properties inherent in it(See slide)... http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=418537574836866&set=a.418500614840562.105105.147879531902673&type=3&theater\\nWhat I need to do this year is create some sort of media event around the theory and myself. Currently I'm a voice in the wilderness and an almost completely unknown speaker\/thinker. I believe I could steal the show at the next Singularity Summit and this might create some sort of media sensation or Perhaps TED but that would miss the deadline. My longer term aim is to push through a very compelling and convincing (I believe) Revolutionary 21st Century Worldview(Weltanshauung) that includes at the heart of it, the fractal Cosmology and of which the brain is part and which it completely reflects; and also importantly the 'Everyone is God' idea or put another way that the Mystery of Consciousness and Mystery of God are One and the same. Or Ontological Idealism versus Materialism. This is the original source and basis of Spiritual, Enlightenment and Humanistic values and crucial foundation for the coming World Revolution. To change the world you need to change the whole constellation of outdated ideas that are dominant in it. A lot of people talk about the need for a paradigm shift but the existing paradigms don't want to be shifted. So therefore we need to initiate the Weltanschauungskrieg or war of World Views. We first win the battle in the realm of ideas and only then can you have a meaningful worthwhile revolution in the social, political and economic realms. The Brain Theory and accompanying Weltanschauung is what is needed for instigating and succeeding in this very necessary undertaking I believe. It's so clear to me, the cutting edge of Science and Bleeding edge of Hi-Technology(or Next Edge) will be the complete return of the oldest of the old, the perennial and eternal, or Esoteric Pagan Mystery Religion. How's that for a film script or computer game storyline.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-05-16T21:46:10+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"299734010114360\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"id\":\"665043478\"},\"message\":\"Wai H. Tsang - how ripe is Fractal Brain Theory for deep scientific scrutiny?  I'm connected here in San Diego with the Salk and the Neurosciences Institute and in Santa Fe with the Santa Fe Institute.  I'm not sure that going through the \\\"science gauntlet\\\" is a desirable or optimal strategy, but if it is on your agenda, let me know when you are ready.\\n\\nIMHO, your best approach is to let much of the deeper insight of FBT simply unfold (with, perhaps, some nudging) - rather than lead with it.  I call this the \\\"mysterious genius\\\" meme.  If someone comes in and promises me the world, all of my skeptical defense mechanisms are turned on full blast and they have a lot of explaining to do before I give them any benefit of doubt.  By contrast, if someone goes in and does something really amazing that is 'digested' as amazing within the existing paradigm (say, invents Google), then they are given the mantle of \\\"mysterious genius\\\" and are given the right to toss out a few \\\"crazy\\\" ideas with the benefit of the doubt.  \\n\\nIn your case, everything lines up nicely - hit the first domino hard.  Win the case at the deep scientific level.  Then immediately follow up with some big win at the technological level.  This simultaneously slots you into the two most powerful \\\"mysterious genius\\\" spots available in the current memetic landscape (scientific and technological) *and* puts you on the radar of the biggest schizotypal power groups.  \\n\\nFrom there it is a simple walk-through and use of the bully pulpit to expand on the esoteric fundamentals of FBT.  Combine that with the real, practical benefits that FBT has brought in the body of technology and you can close the loop on the Apocalyptic story. (Particularly the 'promised land' piece.)

Tsang\",\"id\":\"557363854\"},\"message\":\"I think even at this stage I can give a long presentation to a lecture hall full of Neuroscience professionals, PHds, professors, Nobel prize winners and make a really strong impression. After all, you saw me give a long talk about politics, religion, world history, the problems of the world, the universe and God etc. and it all comes across as sensible and coherent. I've been getting very positive feedback from some extremely intelligent people and this encourages me to believe that this is so. So it is with the Fractal Brain Theory presentations. Apart from accounting for a huge amount of neuroscientific and psychological facts, in a unifying and elegant way, the theory also contains within it some deep and profound symmetries which will impress any thinking person. I can communicate these now and my act will get slicker and sharper w.r.t the Brain Theory, as the months and years progress. It may be highly synchronous that you are connected with the Neuroscience institute and Sante Fe Institute. What I need is some high profile patron or supporter who will stick his or her neck out and make some positive public comments about my work. Gerald Edelman might be sympathetic because the theory shows that the process of evolution is happening in the brain, though not exactly like how his Neural Darwinism works. It also shows that the process of evolution, the process of the brain and also the process of Ontogenesis or Neurogenesis (i.e. The formation of bodies and brains) are really the same underlying process. Of course the 'science gauntlet' is a challenge and there'll be a lot of closed and\/or critical minds. But there's something very elegant and even simple about the theory and I believe most people will get it quite quickly. w.r.t. the Santa Fe institute, the theory has something to say about Complexity theory too. In a sense the theory describes a sort of cellular automata. It's like a sort of class 5, that to my knowledge, Stephen Wolfram hasn't included in his taxonomy. that is a cellular automata that is able to recursively alter, extend and augment its own rule set. This is the trick of Nature and Intelligence I think. In his 'New kind of Science' book he's trying to use Cellular Automata as a way of understanding the Universe. Which is exactly what I believe of the brain theory. He'll love it. Alternatively If I can persuade Ray Kurzweil that I can produce the Technological Singularity way before his estimate of 2029 and that the Singularity nearer than he thinks; then perhaps I'll get his support. 'two most powerful Mysterious Genius spots' haha I love the expression. You read my mind, I need to get into a position where powerful schizotypals listen to and take seriously the things I talk about. But that's more in the future. Currently I'm a hidden factor and protagonist in waiting. And yes I actually believe whole heartedly in the Mythic or Apocalypse archetype and that it really is unfolding in present times. It isn't just an academic exercise for me. It also happens to provide a neat backdrop and stimulus for Revolutionary Movements. And yes it will help a lot that the 'deep philosophy\/theology' is actually true. The truth always wins in the end, and this is the end(well end of the age anyway). And the word Apocalypse literally means 'the unveiling of the hidden thing'. This hidden thing is the key to a New Heaven(or the original version of it actually) and the Technological Singularity is the key to a New Earth.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-05-17T23:10:11+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"300412443379850\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"id\":\"665043478\"},\"message\":\"Do you currently have specific plans for 'unveiling' FBT in London?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-05-17T23:29:41+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"300925503328544\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Wai H.

The 'unveiling' may seem like the mother of sales pitches for a start up, the start up at the end of time.

There were plans to do something media grabbing with factions of the Occupy movement  but that probably won't happen now. It's funny, the squatted disused school and venue where I did a talk last Sunday got busted by the police a couple days ago and my friends were evicted. Some of my audience for last Sunday couldn't come because they were arrested and held in the protest in London the previous day. Another talk I did in March had to be relocated at the last minute because the original venue was closed down by the police as part of the operation in clearing of the London Occupy St Pauls camp earlier this year.

(Some people might be able to, but they would be one in a billion.)\\n\\nSo we're left with thinking about \\\"parts\\\", \\\"components\\\", going concept by concept.. So in essence, we're all limited in our experience of complexity. One can be \\\"immsersed\\\" in complexity, but I don't think one will be able to actually \\\"experience\\\" that complexity.

I don't think the human brain is capable of such a representation, but I may be wrong. I have an extremely high IQ and am able to have relatively complex thoughts, often non-linear, but honestly I am profoundly limited when it comes to thinking of complex systems.. If there are more than 3 or 4 interrelated, moving parts, I'm unable to think or experience it. So by inductive logic, someone would have to me 1000 times more capable of having complex thoughts than I am, and have a much, much higher IQ, and so I figure that person would be approximately one in a billion.

It is inherent in physics, chemistry, biology, the weather, and more.  So too in human systems.  Our iterated patterning of interacting creates systems that are non-linear, with emergent properties. Complexity and Simplicity are intertwined.  Complex systems in nature and among humans are bounded, acting within the limits of their constraints.  \\n\\nI've thought, written and taught for ten years about complexity.  I think, Hildy, you are right in noting that people have different ways of understanding what we mean by complexity, and different ways of responding to complexity.  In the Western world especially, our views of the world and how things should be, have been greatly impacted by Newton.  So much of the world, and the universe, does work in fundamentally linear and deterministic ways.  We can aim canons and send people to the Moon, because of these discoveries.  So as we mastered the world around us, perhaps combined with an innate inclination, we humans grew to prefer situations that are stable, controllable, and predictable.  \\n\\nTwo key consequences of this thinking and behavior have emerged.  One, especially common in organizations, is the habit of treating truly complex\/adaptive challenges AS IF they were just simple\/complicated\/technical (the adaptive and technical references from Ron Heifetz).  The other, is a lack of understanding what \\\"complexity\\\" means.  I and others have had many discussions with folks who claim that their tool or technique somehow controls or eliminates complexity in software systems, management systems, etc.  They typically fail to understand that if it is very complicated but still linear and deterministic, it isn't \\\"complex.\\\"\\n\\nSo, we humans need to think and share and learn together about this complexity stuff.  Many of us are scared by words like complexity or worse yet, chaos.  We have trouble admitting we are not really in control of many situations, even when our experience tells us so.  We need a new awareness, a new understanding, a new pattern of being, in response to complexity.  The best resource I know on this topic, is from Margaret Wheatley.  Her book, \\\"A Simpler Way,\\\" explains in clear, gentle language, how and why we got the way we are.  The book explains the source of our fear about uncertainty and lack of control.  It is one of the most profound books I know.\\n\\nAs we peer at edges, and verges, we need to learn new adaptive capacities to help us face complex emergent stuff.  Like martial arts masters, we may not know what is coming next. But like them, if we are adaptable, agile, and resilient, we have a better chance of making it.  - Bruce Waltuck, M.A., Complexity, Chaos, and Creativity (yup it says that on the diploma!)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-03T16:20:25+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"346270962127331\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bruce Waltuck\",\"id\":\"100000646860067\"},\"message\":\"Also... Regarding Steven's comment...   \\\"complex systems\\\" do relate to the \\\"war on terror.\\\" The evolution of global terrorism has made it a distributed system, in which individual agents act based on their motivation under a certain ideology.  As the tactics evolve in unpredictable ways, so too must our responses evolve in these ways.  Our political leaders don't fully understand the science, but our military and intelligence communities definitely do. \\n\\nOne characteristic of a complex system is that an analysis of its parts can not explain or predict the behavior of the whole. Changing one part of a complex system is likely to have unintended consequences that can not be predicted or controlled.  In a complex system, we can only try safe-to-fail actions, and learn from them, as we continue to nudge and influence, amplify and stabilize desired outcomes.\\n\\nFinally, on cars... :-) A modern car has about 20,000 parts.

Social Media works because it gives people a sense of identity and belonging. But what about revenues and the way content is shared? People need to be empowered to be the individuals that they are! It's through fear of loss - financial and social - that society holds back. If we create systems that authentically share in reflection to what others give it, the people will come.

Software for building a distributed network, CM is simply a backbone for creating a network on which all else can grow and be shared. To be led by Michel Bauwens of P2P Foundation, the idea is to create a co-op that matches development needs with solution providers and crowd-sourcing\/investor system so the 'guys who get the job' can get paid (voluntary developments welcome too ;). \\n\\nBy 'development needs' I don't just mean modules\/apps\/software integrations, but non-digital needs as well. E.g. Facilitating Community Workshops for teaching Citizen Journalism or Permaculture in Zambia (Yes.. I'd be referring to Steven's amazing 'Water's Edge' project here.. which is nothing short of amazing by the way...).\\n\\nAlthough we still have some development work before we can release the code, CM is\/will be open source. One of the conditions to using the code, however, will be that any developments made will also be open source. Another requirement will be that the code is being used to help create a sustainable world. When someone wants to use CM code to create a network, they'll be asked (in some way or another) to share how their network contributes and why. \\n\\nHere's to BRIDGING VOICES ON THE EDGE OF FREEDOM!

You mentioned what I think is a key term here: Coordination. Other key terms: Planning. Execution. Efficiency.\\n\\nThe goal was to operate The Next Edge as a distributed process, the result was chaos and diminishing participation. Yet this problem was identified and communicated to the group and no one responded (except for 6 Likes).

I get it.\\n\\nWhat did Empires do when they were fighting wars, long before the appearance of the first computer? Well, they had communication networks, they had systems.. Optical telegraphy was used in ancient times, and what kind of signals do you think were most important to the people using them? They certainly weren't using the distributed optical telegraph system to warn people that Queen Kardashian farted.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not a process expert, but I work with signals. To work with a signal, I need to know what kind of signal it is. I'm not asking if it's a wireless signal or what its frequency is, what medium is being used. I do ask those questions, but most importantly, for the work I do, in any case, is identify what kind of signal it is. In my taxonomy of signals, the category of signal Mark gave is at the top of my list of signals I watch out for. It was indicative of something important, and was not heeded. That spells danger in any system that I know of.\\n\\nIf I have a fever of 103 and do nothing, I risk dying. In audio engineering, I watch to make sure the signal doesn't go \\\"in the Red\\\". That's the metaphor I wish to leave you with: \\\"in the Red\\\". Red lights mean Stop at an intersection. The Next Edge, in the case of Mark's post, drove through the Red light.

I propose we need TWO process\/models: 1) starting from the Here&Now (as accurate as possible) and 2) beyond the end game (our visions of a target state\/dynamics after we encounter the corporatist NWO). We need alternatives and rules for scientific competition of alternatives in both domains.  Then we need to work on what joins the models. For example, I believe a primary effort now should be for competency uplift (nu education) out of which new \\\"economic\\\" forms will emerge.  We do need companies for interacting with the existing economic system, but will \\\"companies\\\" be functional components in the new system to replace this existing system?\\n\\nAll this will take time and effort, and thus this complex of projects must be an intermediate objective.  Exploring models (2) will reveal hidden assumptions that limit our alternatives for models (1).  I imagine two domains for (2): transformation or metamorphosis (as more than metaphor). I forecast that the transformation models will prove impossible, but modeling is needed to demonstrate this. This is important as all (1) efforts appear to me in the context of transformation; and potentially a dead end.\\n\\nAs for models (1). Will they need to differ for whether Obama or Romney are presidents the next four years?  What are our alternative societal\/technological environments for the next few years? Second order planning calls for keeping as many options open as possible and not to fixate on one programmatic path. Emergents (by necessity to function as emergents) must mask most ugly contemporary news; which may result in questionable assumptions that their working societal environment for the next few years will be basically unchanged.  Although no one can accurately forecast our turbulent future we need to prepare for alternatives.\\n\\nAll this implies that our efforts must expand orders-of-magnitude. If we are honest about the real challenges we face, and consider the Law of Requisite Variety (Ashbey's Second Law of Cybernetics). our action\/plans must be commensurate with the magnitude\/complexity of our challenge.  In my estimation we need to quickly mobilize and \\\"educate\\\" at least 1\/4 of the global population to meet this challenge.  Our contemporary progress in this direction is not sufficient and there are no existing visions to even attempt such an endevour (other than my own proposals for UPLIFT).\\n\\nA PERSONAL NOTE.

Newspapers, as in traditional media companies, are also doing pretty good. Many print editions were discontinued, but that's the medium, not the institution. News media are bigger than ever.\\n\\nThe Narrative that we have had in the Western world with regard to Egypt, is mostly make-believe. Kodak went down the tubes, but that had little to do with non-hierarchical communication, I don't think.\\n\\nI think that a company that goes out of business is the only one accountable for going out of business. What about the great number of startups that started up and then failed one year later? I'm thinking specifically about startups that built services and products on top of the platforms that have been toppling institutions? Seems like a lot of those \\\"agile\\\", \\\"lean\\\" startups were also toppled.\\n\\nI think the ability of people to connect directly with one another is throwing a lot of the traditional roles of companies into gigantic profits. On another note, the impact that digital media \/ new media has had on society is, at best, trivial. I'm not saying it hasn't had an impact whatsoever, I'm just saying in the grand scheme of things, the impact is trivial. For some, it has impacted social practises, cultural values, what have you.\\n\\nI'm wary of looking at history as a story, and looking at social change for instance as linear, as a step-by-step progression or evolutionary process.. Darwin would probably roll in his grave seeing his name used to characterize some of the things it is being used to characterize. Even technological history, I find, often sounds more like the plot of a Disney movie than anything else. Often what people are calling \\\"disruptive innovations\\\" are actually \\\"sustaining innovations\\\" or not innovations at all, and a lot of the time, what are being called \\\"new technologies\\\" are not in fact new technologies.\\n\\nI often wish I didn't think this way. I could feel \\\"connected\\\" and a part of a \\\"community\\\", part of a \\\"movement\\\", whereas I feel more and more alienated and like an outsider. Plus I feel as though I am playing the part of Professor Killjoy. But feelings aren't facts, anyway. I feel like Napoleon sometimes, what I feel doesn't really have an impact on my life or on the universe. What I think, though, depresses me. What I see, I have cognitions about, cognitions that are depressing. I don't want to live with my eyes closed, though, and I don't see the point in changing my thoughts so that they fit the status quo or moral climate or some Grand Narrative, the vox populi if you will.\\n\\nThe most depressing though, I think, is the thought that these Narratives are not just Narratives.. they are Strategic Narratives.. and they are working perfectly. That thought scares me. Opinion polls will not dictate MY Strategy, though. So for now I am happy jamming the culture jammers. Don't take it personally.

But in recent decades, while our buildings are technically better\u2013more sturdy, more waterproof, more energy efficient\u2013 they have also became progressively more sterile, rarely providing the kind of environment in which people are emotionally nourished, genuinely happy, and deeply contented.\\n\\nUsing the example of his building of the Eishin Campus in Japan, Christopher Alexander and his collaborators reveal an ongoing dispute between two fundamentally different ways of shaping our world. One system places emphasis on subtleties, on finesse, on the structure of adaptation that makes each tiny part fit into the larger context. The other system is concerned with efficiency, with money, power and control, stressing the more gross aspects of size, speed, and profit. This second, \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d system, Alexander argues, is incapable of creating the kind of environment that is able to genuinely support the emotional, whole-making side of human life. To confront this sterile system, the book presents a new architecture that we\u2013both as a world-wide civilization, and as individual people and cultures\u2013can create, using new processes that allow us to build places of human energy and beauty. The book outlines nine ways of working, each one fully dedicated to wholeness, and able to support day-to-day activities that will make planning, design and construction possible in an entirely new way, and in more humane ways.\u201d\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQBRg9itKNDYMZYI&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.p2pfoundation.net%2Fp2pf-avatar.png\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/blog.p2pfoundation.net\/the-forbidden-education-documentary-on-alternatives\/2012\/08\/23\",\"name\":\"The Forbidden Education: documentary on alternatives\",\"caption\":\"blog.p2pfoundation.net\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/344790912275336\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/344790912275336\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-08-30T03:45:51+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-08-30T04:59:16+0000\",\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"344804905607270\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"id\":\"1063904902\"},\"message\":\"Thank you.

The mathematical proof states it will take over eventually. It is more efficient, will create trillions of dollars of value that right now is just sitting there wasting away. Believe me, one thing the present system will NOT resist is the injection of trillions of dollars of value.

Zertify seeks to eliminate the idea of competition from an economy.  When that happens layers of mangers, brokers, governance, corruption and vetting institutions become irrelevant across broad swaths of economic activity.  That is the frictionless  outcome we envision, not technological scaling of competition.  MT vastly increases the pool of workers who they set into competition with each other to drive down cost.  MT further limits the production only to that which can be transmitted in digital space and adding a layer of brokerage. In the larger system, these constraints create friction, not reduce it.   Innocentive is another broker that has only been successful in a fairly limited silo of activity.

Penalize is a big word, it could be done in a playful way, like you get #props as a reward and #unprops as a \\\"punishment\\\".\\n\\n2) A moderator or community manager is usually a must, if there is no structure and discipline, people will end up talking about everything and nothing at the same time. In French we call it talking about \\\"la pluie et le bon temps\\\", basically translates to talking about the weather. Small talk, though, or \\\"phatic communication\\\" is extremely important, as is social grooming.. It's hard to have both social and topic-based discussion, though.. You might have to separate the two which leads me to\\n\\n3) Consistent tagging with a controlled vocabulary\/taxonomy. You can have a tag for small talk, example of a statement \\\"Hi everyone I'm just getting in from a long walk, it was very refreshing, it's beautiful outside #smalltalk\\\"..\\n\\nThen in the next paragraph, I can get into the topic, eg. \\\"What do you think the sollution is to problem X? #Q&A #process #bestpractises\\\"..\\n\\nYou can take a group, look at the conversation, do a quick audit of the content, find the main categories, the different things that are being talked about, or the different kinds of discourses, like #smalltalk vs. #brainstorming vs. #tasks (#task-management or #scheduling, #planning, etc.).. decide on a simple taxonomy, and get everyone to apply it consistently.. Reward people for using the taxonomy, hold people accountable for not using it. I find simple #kudos are a hugely rewarding, and getting a #slapintheface is very NOT rewarding, and I'm talking about simple tags themselves.. Like when someone Facebook \\\"Likes\\\" something I wrote, it's rewarding.. Which is weird because it seems so unlikely that such a pretentious, superficial thing as clicking a button would be rewarding, but anyway it is.\\n\\nConclusion: The problem of chaos you seem to be talking about, Amy Kirschner, is BEHAVIORAL. I say so-called \\\"noise\\\" is behavioral because by definition noise in a stream or forum exists because people are posting things that are a) irrelevant or b) off-topic, c) pointless, unnecessary, whatever else one might want to call it. The problem with that is one person's noise is often another person's signal. What you want to do is persuade people to change the behavior, though, if it's a behavioral problem. For that, maybe Persuasive Tech is a good place to start. http:\/\/captology.stanford.edu\/ - It might be a technical problem though, like the way Facebook Groups are designed, without hashtags, without threaded discussions (not really), no advanced search, with algorithms that basically make 90% of conversations disappear in the stream.. algorithms whose only purpose is to extract information to optimize ad placement.. Hence, great discipline is needed to circumvent the limitations of the platform.. And it really is extremely limited. I hope Facebook Groups get the Timeline design, it would be much better I think, to some extent.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":2002,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-29T19:29:11+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzQ0NjYyMjkyMjg4MTk4\",\"before\":\"MzQ0NTY5MjAyMjk3NTA3\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_344417335646027\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"i'm hosting an event in SF on September 12th - perhaps some of you would like to come along - http:\/\/edgelabsynergy.eventbrite.com\/\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/edgelabsynergy.eventbrite.com\/\",\"name\":\"EdgeLab Synergy\",\"caption\":\"www.eventbrite.com\",\"description\":\"It is time for another EdgeLab social gathering.

In order to cocreate our future society, we need to sufficiently align around a sufficient\\nly desired pull. A purpose attractive enough, simple enough to understand, evoking and instilling a longing, a desire to move towards it.\\n\\n*Change programmes often leads to waste of effort*\\nWhat is often an unnecessary constraint in many worthwhile projects and efforts, is the (hidden) expectations and assumptions that they need to take place wholly inside the old narratives. This makes it near impossible to achieve anything new, since all narratives typically resists being changed. One of the results of this, is that typically between 80 - 90 percent of change programmes are wasted.\\n\\n*Catalyze, nurture and build on the resourcefulness of people*\\nA better approach, is to set up a pull, and build a sufficiently shared and shareable understanding in a large enough, critical mass of people (stakeholders, participants, players) in a way (eg through a desirable, empowering, sufficiently simple, sufficiently deep and rich catalyzing narrative) that instils a desire, a longing, to move towards it. Most people are quite resourceful finding paths towards reaching what they desire.\\n\\n*A great sense of loss is perfect soil for seeds of renewal*\\nRight now, most people find themselves living between narratives - and thus, experiencing a great sense of loss, a sense of life having lost a significant part of its meaning. This is perfect, fertile soil for sharing seeds of longing for something new, for something different, for something more meaningful.\\n\\n*Dialogue is Empowerment - Play is Resilience*\\nThrough dialogue, this new sense of meaning can be glimpsed.

FINALLY have some idea of what's up with the state of formal education in Europe.\\n\\nIt kind of started in 2010 when I participated in an event around learning Freedom and the Web hosted by Mozilla and co-organised by their community of volunteers (thank you Nathaniel James ). It was generative on many levels. I met some lovely people, and got the push I needed to explore some of my own interests to do with learning. More than anything I started to understand the importance of developing a personal frame of enquiry and a personal frame of enquiry. Last year I did several talks and workshops at events ranging from massive general audience ones like Learning without Frontiers organised by Graham Brown-Martin and smaller more specialised ones like the Free Culture Incubator organised by Ela Kagel.\\n\\nOlder generations, the private sector, government institutions and parents have contributed to society\u2019s encouraging young people focus their energies, and put their eggs into the basket of being good at school (and penalising those who were not). And Education is big business with many stakeholders involved. What with youth unemployment hitting the roof there is a lot of debate around learning and many people are discussing the need for reforms in formal education systems in Europe (and beyond). They range all the way from snake-oil salesmen trying to sell gadgets and proprietary software as the end all solution to our educational woes to angry headteachers wanting minister's hide for unfairly changing the rules on kids in mid-game. There is a lot at stake.\\n\\nBut how did we get here and where does it make sense to push for change?\\n\\nI think it's true for a lot of what we want to achieve that it is hard to get an overview of what's going on, what forces are pulling in which directions. This was part of the aim of getting the researchers help in contextualising the experiences we have been sharing and mapping out the territory. For me personally this is a much more important contribution because it helps us go ok- so this is what we are facing and then direct our energies pragmatically.\\n\\nI read the research report that Piotr Mikiewicz and Pruden GE produced about Learning commissioned by Edgeryders. It was pretty interesting and a lot of things fell into place for me about how formal education works in Europe. So I spent the weekend summarising it for you, me and everyone we know.\\n\\nWe can do much much better that the state of contemporary political tennis matches- just cheap shots and no creative solutions. . It's oue future and we all own a stake in it. Come check it out, poke holes in it and add the questions you want to have answered.

The release of the rules enables Section 1504 to finally take effect, and the effected companies will shortly need to begin reporting as required by law.\\n\\nWhile Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based research and advocacy organization which supports the transparency law, cannot yet definitively comment on the content of the implementing rules\u2014the organization is currently in the process of thoroughly reviewing the regulations\u2014GFI welcomed the scheduling of today\u2019s vote and noted both some heartening and discouraging language from the SEC meeting.\\n\\n\u201cWe are happy to see the SEC move forward with issuing rules today for Section 1504,\u201d said Heather Lowe, Legal Counsel and Director of Government Affairs at GFI.  \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re more than a year past the April 2011 deadline for releasing the rules required by law.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWe are very heartened by statements made by SEC staff at the meeting suggesting that the implementing rules will not provide exemptions on reporting information for countries that may forbid such disclosure,\u201d added Lowe.  \u201cStill, there were some comments made by SEC staff about provisions of the rules that were concerning to us.  Until we review the rules carefully, we cannot verify the accuracy or strength of any of those comments.\u201d\\n\\nSection 1504, also known as the Cardin-Lugar provision, has garnered praise from civil society groups around the world as an historic measure to bring increased stability, accountability, and transparency to a multi-billion dollar, global industry.\\n\\n\u201cAs legislated, Cardin-Lugar will help combat everything from undisclosed investor risk to tax evasion to corruption,\u201d noted Ms.  Lowe.  \u201cIt is a game changer, put simply, for good corporate governance efforts worldwide as well as for governance efforts in the countries in which extractive companies operate.\u201d\\n\\nGFI estimates that developing countries lose roughly $1 trillion per year to crime, corruption and tax evasion, much of which is facilitated by opacity in the global financial system.  The organization explained that the transparency measures included in Sec. 1504 could help significantly curtail these illicit outflows.\\n\\nFor example, Libya\u2014the tenth biggest oil exporter worldwide\u2014lost $43.32 billion in illicit outflows from 2000-2009, according to GFI\u2019s research.  Over the weekend, Najwa al-Beshti, the former head of contracts at Libya\u2019s state-owned oil company, wrote in The New York Times that he witnessed \u201csystemic underpricing of oil and the discounting of prices for select foreign companies.\u201d  Mr. al-Beshti goes on to argue that Section 1504 \u201ccan help prevent such corruption from happening again,\u201d thereby helping to \u201cprevent future tyrants from emerging.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cIf the SEC\u2019s implementing rules issued today are strong, they will help curtail corruption, money laundering, and corporate tax evasion in Libya, Angola, Nigeria and elsewhere,\u201d added Lowe.  \u201cIt would be a significant advancement for the developing world and for investors.\u201d\\n\\nGlobal Financial Integrity is a member of the Publish What You Pay Coalition, which is sponsoring a conference call for journalists to discuss the final rules at 10am EDT on Thursday, August 23, 2012\u2014the morning after the rules are to be released.  The panel\u2014made up of experts from Publish What You Pay US, Oxfam America, ONE, Revenue Watch Institute, and Global Witness\u2014will provide an in-depth analysis of the rules, explaining specific rule requirements and their implications for investors, civil society groups, citizens in resource-rich countries and the United States, as well as forthcoming European Union rules.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-24T19:21:57+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"343022119118882\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Laurinda Seabra\",\"id\":\"1054127617\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2012\/08\/07\/news\/economy\/dodd-frank-energy\/index.htm\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-24T19:22:50+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"343022265785534\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Laurinda Seabra\",\"id\":\"1054127617\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/18\/opinion\/a-libyans-plea-to-the-sec-on-oil-industry-rules.html\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-24T19:23:34+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"343022389118855\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Laurinda Seabra\",\"id\":\"1054127617\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/raymond-baker\/oil-exporting-countries-corruption_b_1269611.html\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-24T19:23:52+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"343022652452162\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Laurinda Seabra\",\"id\":\"1054127617\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/www.gfintegrity.org\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-24T19:24:41+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"343028675784893\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jeff Mowatt\",\"id\":\"813379376\"},\"message\":\"By coimcidence, that's what I have been doing.

When I was 8 we moved to Greenville, South Carolina. One of the first things that happened to me was to get beat up by a neighborhood kid for being a Yankee. It was a set up,  the kid's mother intervened before the beating got completely out of hand. She then proceeded to lecture me about what it is to be a Southerner.\\n\\nThe way the story of the Southern Culture of Honor is usually told is about settlement patterns of herders and farmers. I was only 2 when my family moved from the mountains of Virginia to the mountains of Maryland, even still I've got an affinity for hill-people. And I think the way the story is told gets hill-people wrong, but so be it, that's how the story is told. Because I was an oddball I've long wondered what is it with being Southern. Lots of Americans wonder too, and honor goes a long way towards understanding.\\n\\nAs a point of academic interest the Southern Culture of Honor is mostly viewed from the perspective of pathology. That's a useful perspective, but misses quite a lot. Kwame Appiah has done a good service by pointing out how honor can remake society--how honor can produce positive cultural change.\\n\\nI was thinking along these lines prompted by DK Matai's Gold thread.

The trouble with bifurcating issues as a way of making meaning is it's too simplistic and the details really matter. Anyhow it's common to talk about American politics in terms of poles: Red State\/Blue State. Implicit in the construction of Red State is some idea of Dixie.\\n\\nI go on and on off-topic but was interested in Curtis Faith's Ayn Rand Post. Rather than foul-up that thread, I figured I ramble on in one of my threads.\\n\\nRyan seems a bundle of contradictions; e.g., An Ayn Rand acolyte  and fundamentalist Catholic, vehemently anti-state, but his family fortune built on government contracts, a water-carrier for the largest corporations in the world and a fan of Rage Against the Machine. Even though Ryan is from Wisconsin he represents \\\"Red State\\\" politics.\\n\\nNisbett and Cohen's sociological study of violence in the south uses the construct of a culture of honor to locate the difference between Yankee and Rebel. I don't buy it completely, especially the part of the herding versus farming which  David Hackett Fischer  presented in his book \\\"Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America.\\\" \\n\\nNevertheless, the focus on notions of honor does seem to me a good way of making sense of divided worldviews in the USA. One of the advantages of honor instead of arguments about ethics or morality is the affect or emotional component is inextricably tied to ideas of honor.\\n\\nMy point about Ryan and his followers is that rather than to try to change attitudes by way of reason, those who oppose the political views Ryan espouses might to well to engage with the emotional component of Ryan's worldview and to acknowledge an emotional bond with his revolutionary ethos.\\n\\nAs  Stirling Newberry points out  the division between Confederates and Progressives is in our hearts. The comment by  Alan Kuska that \\\"The Fountainhead\\\" reminded  him of Occupy Wall Street made me think of Newberry's observation.  It's an apt comparison, but not an easy one for Ryan and his fellow travelers to make because they hate the guts of Progressives and vice versa. \\n\\nIn Southern mythology of the Civil War the brother against brother theme is well understood, so Southerners understand on some level the tragedy of familiarity.  Whereas Yankees and the rest of us probably think of the divide as more Mars and Venus. I think there's an opening, especially in face to face politics, to seeing a common emotional bond between the people representing the most polarized part of out body politic.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1574340159\",\"name\":\"Thomas Sherlock\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Curtis Faith\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":364,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-22T21:55:22+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"342600339161060\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\",\"id\":\"520685736\"},\"message\":\"<mucho like>\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-23T12:23:28+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzQyNjAwMzM5MTYxMDYw\",\"before\":\"MzEwNDM1MTMyMzc3NTgx\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_342593559161738\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Sofus Midtgaard\",\"id\":\"663695554\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Return on Sustainability?

We must of course make sure there are enough seeds, etc. to actually do\\nit, which requires supply chain analysis and Geographic Information\\nSystems, which are readily available today.\\n\\nI was in three immediate situations where someone was needed to step\\nforward and lead --\\n1. when the New Schools Exchange national conference drew twice as many participants as planned; I simply talked to the park rangers, found out\\nwhere to direct campers, asked them to set up their camps and then go up to\\nthe first campground for a meeting. Easy sleazy!\\n2. when a drunken fool kicked over a Hell's Angel's motorcycle at Altamont. After the owner knocked him down and kicked him a few times, another Angel picked him up and threw him up the hillside. Everyone leaving the concert maintained a constant radius distance from the scene. So I and one other\\nguy (carefully) went down the hill, picked him up, and walked him toward\\nthe first aid station until he shook us off. That told us he was not far\\nmore seriously hurt; if he had been, we would have gotten him to help as\\nfast as it was possible to do at the time.\\n3. when the SDS led the students of San Jose State University to take over\\nthe Administration Building during the Vietnam War, there were about 300 of\\nus wondering what to do next. So I went up to the SDS and asked them if\\nthey had a plan for what to do next, pointing out the police surrounding\\nthe building and looking down at us through the skylights -- nope! So I\\ntold them to ask everyone to divide up into groups of 10 to 12 and make\\nlists of demands, select one volunteer to represent each group, and bring\\nthe demands together and collate them, and list them in order of\\npopularity, then present them to the administration. In ten minutes 300\\npeople were making lists, and there were zero negative incidents that day.\\nIt's just, what is the most straightforward way to solve the problem so\\nthat people's needs and goals are respected, and it fits the way that\\npeople function naturally? In the case of the world and humanity, it's\\ndesign and build knowledgebases that enable us to organize accurate\\nknowledge for each ecosystem, eco-region, and culture \/ language, which\\nbecomes a foundation for about 823 parallel development programs (for each eco-region), with more detailed planning by each of the 5,000 to 7,000\\ncultures which speak different languages that still exist. They recover\\ntheir cultural heritage if possible, looking to it for guidance on how to\\nlive in the eco-region or ecosystems with which they co-evolved. Then add communication technologies and whatever else that exists today and can\\nmitigate the damage to their eco-region and their culture in the last 500\\nyears. You have 7 billion people, maybe 7,000 languages. That's a million\\npeople per language, on average, though some are far more, and many are far less. But it's enough to get the job done if even 1% pitch in, and I know\\nthat at least several % have a lot to contribute. We get the job done and\\nlaunch what we design in each eco-region, in parallel, all out of the same knowledgebase. The unused alternative technologies waiting for their chance\\nto conserve natural resources and serve people better are just the icing on\\nthe cake.\\n\\nThe psychological energy that I brought into play in each of the three\\ninstances above is the same energy we bring into play by following the\\nscenario I am teaching.

Neurons (brain cells) do this by changing which other neurons or axons their axons connect to, as a result of the electric and chemical patterns oscillating together or in different patterns. Crickets change which crickets they are connected to by flying to places they like the sounds of other crickets more. They become neurally connected to the other crickets some amount in how their neurons adjust to the local sounds of other crickets, so they start to make their oscillating sounds mostly in synchronization. Like brainwaves, the sounds of large groups of crickets flow in smooth waves and react to other waves depending on direction and timing and at least the recent history of waves in that location.\\n\\nThe wave based communication of Humans is far more limited than crickets, seen in places like dance clubs, prices in stock markets (less total stocks than neurons in a small number of crickets brains), body language, etc, but these wave based communications of Humans do not tend to spread to other Humans nearly as well as oscillating sounds spread in large groups of crickets. Humans communicate mostly in words. Crickets communicate mostly in waves.

Using Abandon Mills around the NE is excellent way to build infrastructure of Our research etc into rebuilding USA from the inside out. From the Emergent Beauty of rich natural resources. \\n\\nI lived all over the NE so I am very familiar with this History.. My favorite Mill area is a sweet little community outside of Hartford VT and Hanover NH.. Near Woodstock VT called Quechee .It is the site of the Quechee Gorge on the Ottauquechee River and is also the home to the Quechee Lakes planned community initiated in the late 1960s, which also brought to the community the small Quechee Lakes Ski Area in the 1970s. \\n\\nThe History of WHY Quechee was created in first place in 1700 to build Mills using this Powerful water and it grand falls to generate the Mills that made all kinds of products with the most recent being Glass . Quechee is now home to Irish glass blower Simon Pearce purchased the former woolen mill in 1980. The building that drove the village economy for about 100 years again took on a new commercial use, this time for glass blowing factory and pottery produc tion and fine dining. I believe Simon Pearce is using the Power from the Water to operate their Mill for glass blowing and pottery making  !\\n\\nStarting in Chatham NY there is potential to  start the inhabitation of building new communities as there are many empty mills and old wonderful history from 1600 1700  like this all over the North East ! Bringing life to them will bring attention to the fact these mills were run by the water power which is so glorious in aliveness ! \\n\\nQuechee was also known for a picturesque covered bridge at the site of the old Quechee mill, which now houses a commercial glass-blowing facility. The bridge was severely damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene (2011).\\n\\nThis unexpected flooding due to rains of Irene last Aug 2011 was due to having a harsh winter of much snow and ground still saturated but more so it was due to the fact our ecosystem of water movement in USA is very unhealthy due to so much is polluted as the water makes it way down the USA into Everglades for drainage out into the seas.. It is Everglades that is really messed up which is big part of problem to creating back up like this that does this flash flooding around country.\\n\\nEarly Town proprietors saw the value of river land. In 1765, they voted to grant 600 acres adjacent to the river falls as an incentive to attract saw and grist mills. They envisioned mills bringing the Town job and growth benefits. By 1774, the Town conveyed land to John Marsh providing he establish a saw and grist mill within two years. Both mills were built and operational within four years. Over the next forty years, the mill property changed hands many times.\\nQuechee Historic Mill District - Town of Hartford Vermont\\nwww.hartford-vt.org\/downloads\/492\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-03T11:19:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"336258166461944\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Cassandra Rose\",\"id\":\"100001388966789\"},\"message\":\"The author of this is  Michael Forrester is a spiritual counselor and is a practicing motivational speaker for corporations in Japan, Canada and the United States.

The man-made rules and regulations that are used to govern the people are necessary only as long as the people don\u2019t know how to live in accordance with the natural laws of life, for lack of self love. This trend is shifting fast and the turbulence that is gripping mankind is all part of it. Humankind is waking up, and there is nothing that can stop it now. Love will replace control as the dominating power of life on earth.\\n\\nThe importance of the Collective Consciousness will be attributable to the following:\\n\\nNo Government Control - The Internet is point-to-point communication. No government can control all points.No Language Barriers - Advances in software afford almost simultaneous translation across multiple platforms.No Friction - Business models based upon lack of information will fail.No Spin - Multiple access points means less opportunity for special interests to control people by spinning information.Infinite Collaboration - Think it, design it, share it, fail and start again at high speed.Commonality - People discover that they really are not that different after all, which aligns interests.\\nTraditional government will soon fragment. The existing government as we know it will change rapidly. Today\u2019s government paradigms worked for getting things done for the last century with methodologies that cannot operate with the upgraded thought processes of collective consciousness. The people of earth have decided it\u2019s time for a shift and governments will have to either adapt or be left behind as archaic and outdated controls. If they do adapt it will be government 2.0 for the people.

How will emerging leaders essentially give back enough to the system that supports them to ensure continued support?\\n\\nA: The institute will be based off of systems of mutuality rather than reciprocity. People who give to the Institute (providing housing, resources, contacts, mentorship, etc) will only give that which they have in abundance and can give freely. Reciprocity implies that one offers something with an expectation or hope of positive future responses. Mutuality operates from a basis of abundance where people who offer resources to emerging leaders do so not because they expect increasing returns, but because they offer something they can give of freely that simultaneously supports their own intrinsic motivations. For example, an anti-homelessness activist providing free housing to an emerging leader working on homelessness issues.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"587572171\",\"name\":\"Kevin Jones\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":11},{\"id\":\"725829941\",\"name\":\"Arthur Brock\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":274,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:26:35+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340893695998391\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"id\":\"904115122\"},\"message\":\"We need to learn how not to quantify things...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:29:50+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340893979331696\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"Suresh Fernando we need to learn how not to quantify all things\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"904115122\",\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:31:10+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340894869331607\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"id\":\"904115122\"},\"message\":\"It's also important to understand that in the modern world many people are trapped in jobs and circumstances that prevent them from doing things they would like to do like helping others.

This hike will take place on Thursday August 16th. \\n\\nThe hike itself will begin at 5:30 from near the Mountain Home Inn 810 Panoramic Highway Mill Valley, CA 94941. \\n\\nBut this time we are approaching the challenge of gathering differently than we have in the past. David, Katie and Bobby will gather early with all who wish to gather early from 3:30pm on at Dipsea Cafe. Dipsea cafe is located at 200 Shoreline Hwy, Mill Valley, CA 94941 ( just when you get off the highway). We'll be there until a little past 5 when we will carpool over to the Mount Home Inn and from there we will head on to the trail. Dipsea is a nice little cafe with Greek snacks, coffee, tea, bear, wine, etc. We would recommend that people who are able to meet there first do so because this will guarantee that you will be able to join the hike when it goes. Our Marin hikes leave almost on time. \\n\\nI'm also pleased to say that we've found a time when David Hodgson, Katie Johnson and I, Bobby Fishkin can join in for a hike in San Francisco. Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and cadence of creativity. \\n\\nFor our San Francisco hike please arrive by 5:50pm on Friday August 24th at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue  San Francisco, CA 94121).

In either case, capital (i.e. the money to buy equipment and supplies) can be either an investment or a cost, as when capital must be borrowed, the repayment with interest is a cost.  This aspect is not new, or unique.  Labor investment in an organization is a common feature of start up small business partnerships, in which the partners work without salary until the business is established.\\n\\nAnother distinction exists in the forms.  In a CST we distribute what we produce directly to the labor that produced it.  That eliminates whole regulatory regimes such as taxation and securities regulation.  It also means that we do not have market restraints.  The market restricts production to that which can be sold at a profit.  In a CST we can produce for whatever demand there is within the organization.\\n\\nI disagree with the statement you quote regarding the nature of scarcity in the system.  It is the nature of markets that what is exchanged is that which is relatively scare to someone else in the market who has the money to pay for it.  When we only measure value in a market based medium of exchange, then we only value that which is relatively scarce.  The key then is to find a way to value that which humans need to thrive, which could be abundant, such as food, clothing, shelther,  education and health care, and find a different (non-market based) way to produce those things.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":6},{\"id\":\"1406709310\",\"name\":\"Monika\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":21,\"length\":6}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T16:52:37+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339518286135932\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"id\":\"528245547\"},\"message\":\"thanks David, will expore it more, though I'm  not sure what your last paragraph refers to, since I agree with it, and I think, this is exactly what I think as well, i.e. there can be an outgrowing of markets to the degree that we succeed in finding successfull non-market forms.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-13T14:44:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339543882800039\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Braden\",\"id\":\"578038073\"},\"message\":\"Sorry, I should be more specific.

Economic institutions are themselves the products of political processes, which depend on political institutions.

As so often is the case my thinking goes off wildly in different directions. But I want to put out a couple of statements which seem to relate to the problem and solution James Kwak review of \\\"Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty\\\" present.\\n\\nThis thread is right below the thread on Michel Bauwens brilliant article \\\"Peer-to-peer production and the coming of the commons.\\\" In Bauwens page on Netarchical Capitalism Bauwens writes:\\n\\n\\\"The problem with these solutions is that they often aim to \u2018capitalize\u2019 everything, and do not have any regard for the surviving forms of the commons which are still very much alive in certain areas of the South, destroying the traditional social fabric.\\\"\\n\\nI was thinking about that problem last night as I read an essay written by Ivan Illich in 1973 \\\"Energy and Equity.\\\" Illich talks about the radical monopoly of industry:\\n\\n\u201cA branch of industry does not impose a radical monopoly on a whole society by the simple fact that it produces scarce products, or by driving competing industries off the market, but rather by virtue of its acquired ability to create and shape the need which it alone can satisfy.\u201d\\n\\nIllich illustrates the implications with shoes. Schools require students to be shod, governments make schooling compulsory; therefore shoes become a requirement for an education. But nothing is done to enable people without shoes to obtain them, so education remains out of reach. \\n\\nThe voter ID laws which have proliferated in the states follow this same kind of logic. I'm afraid that economic power takes more seriously Netocracy than the rest of us do and that politics as government mostly feeds the positive feedback loop for economic power rather than the anti feedback loop.  \\n\\nUnderstanding netarchical capitalism and radical monopoly seen necessary in order to envision any counter politics.\\n\\nhttp:\/\/p2pfoundation.net\/Netarchical_Capitalism\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T19:58:26+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339276356160125\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"Illich's \\\"energy and Equity\\\" link http:\/\/clevercycles.com\/energy_and_equity\/#therad\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T19:58:55+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339277179493376\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"cc: Phil Jones\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"732234881\",\"name\":\"Phil Jones\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":4,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T20:00:37+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzM5Mjc3MTc5NDkzMzc2\",\"before\":\"MzM5Mjc2MjUyODI2ODAy\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_339267809494313\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Tiberius Brastaviceanu\",\"id\":\"100000279944184\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Explaining SENSORICA and the \\\"value network\\\" model, \\nvideo made by Benjamin Brownell   \\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ou6dFH8Qr30\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQCFLPj4-aIrmlvo&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi4.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fou6dFH8Qr30%2Fmqdefault.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ou6dFH8Qr30\",\"source\":\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/ou6dFH8Qr30?version=3&autohide=1&autoplay=1\",\"name\":\"TiberiusB Interview\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yj\/r\/v2OnaTyTQZE.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/339267809494313\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/339267809494313\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"video\",\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T19:25:54+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-08-12T19:25:54+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"673621474\",\"name\":\"Bert-Ola Bergstrand\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NjUyNTAzMTY4\",\"before\":\"NjczNjIxNDc0\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_339127549508339\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Floris Koot\",\"id\":\"536626881\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"I think we should distinguish Exclusive Capitalism (what I do and own, is none of your business as long it's within the law) and Inclusive Capitalism (what I do and own, and how I own, will affect everything and everyone around me, and therefore asks me to be careful, considerate and accept limits to my behavior, or better demands me to consider my contribution to the whole, rather than just to me).\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/339127549508339\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/339127549508339\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T09:31:55+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-08-12T19:12:07+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"562561843\",\"name\":\"Matt Richards\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"},{\"id\":\"817210174\",\"name\":\"Jonathan Sundqvist\"},{\"id\":\"674516612\",\"name\":\"John F Powers\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"537085800\",\"name\":\"Leif Edvinsson\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzM5MDA4ODU5\",\"before\":\"NTYyNTYxODQz\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"339166022837825\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\",\"id\":\"14935\"},\"message\":\"Floris, >>what I do and own, and how I own, will affect everything and everyone around me....

Our AWESOME CREATOR series highlights the work of important, challenging creation on the part of community members from a range of disciplines, while the FIELD NOTES series functions in particular as a space for the community to validate and explore process over product: to \\\"open source\\\" their work as well as the life that they may not categorize AS work -- in the process encouraging mindfulness and reflexivity.\\n\\nIn inviting members from this community\/leader labs to engage with us not to talk about \\\"product\\\" but the challenge of building from the INSIDE we humanize the experience. I invited Kyle to begin the series as the first man on the ground, the first \\\"participant-observer\\\" (to borrow from my own anthro training) in particular *because* of his non-\\\"expert\\\" position. The honesty of the challenge and the confusion and the reality of difficulty is beautiful and wonderful to share and experience together, and to air. The stories will find new audiences, who may give back to this network creative inspiration or collaboration of a sort not previously imagined.\\n\\nIf you're not yet familiar with how ExSt is envisioned as a platform, you can read my recent interview with coldfront mag here. \\n\\ncoldfrontmag.com\/features\/poetry-festival-preview-exit-strata\\n\\nI know that you are the guiding team and therefore busy but before we start running with it I want to invite you to be part of introducing the series and also to feel free to send images, video, notes, quotes, and framework -- as well as any guidance towards what you might NOT want shared. \\n\\nI'm hoping that you are excited to share the guts and go behind the curtain as in keeping with the P2P philosophy of the organization but I do understand that sometimes storytelling can feel premature. ... \\n\\nthat said. open to your ideas and guidance and also your contributions. excited to move ahead. kyle and I wait on your thoughts. \\n\\nI'm going to try to get up there either at the end of this month or when the next cycle starts... I'm not far away. Whenever I can do the most to be of aid and won't be in the way :)\\n\\noh btw -- good news, we have fiscal sponsorship for Exit Strata now so are beginning to write grant apps and fund ourselves for these programs in earnest! I await your thoughts.

Willing to join the stream conference? Then add vogelfreimarkus on skype.\\nFranz Nahrada wrote >\\nDear All,\\n\\nI have been in touch with most of you in the course of the last few weeks about the intended Network Meeting which is going to happen tomorrow, Friday, 11AM CET (summertime). I am informing some additional friends,too.\\n\\nJust as a reminder: more than 20 people will come together on Friday in the rural village of Aigelsberg near Polling near Altheim in the Austrian Border Region of Innviertel at the farm of Rajah Guptara-\u00d6llinger. Rajah is an active network member, with family roots in India, who partly turned his farm into a fine touristic and convention location. We are considering creating a critical mass of activities to \\\"brand\\\" Rajah's farm as a hub for learning and study activities,  especially on all facets of Global Villages, and tomorrow's event is a small inauguration of these.\\n\\nWe have a very fine selection of people attending physically. Among them will be the founder of the New Work Movement, Frithjof Bergmann, and many others involved in the renaiscance of the local in the global age.  The first part of the event, from 11AM to 1PM Central European Summertime, will be dedicated to short presentations - not limited to the people present, but also synchronously and simultaniously connected to remarkable people worldwide in village situations. We will do this with Skype powered by a cloud videoconferencing service (Videomeet). So we will have the possibility to make use of up to 25 interactive streaming slots. In the afternoon we will continue and focus on the local workgroups, but we still will use and pay attention to some global interaction. See below the technical details including the team for production and backchanneling on site.\\n\\nWe will convene contentwise around the following themes:\\n\\n* Is there a new quality in village to village cooperation when we are empowered by bandwidth?  One person that will give us first hand experience is Chis Conder from B4RN, a rural broadband user alliance in the UK.\\n* Will there be shared themes that villages all over the world could work on? We hope to hear from: Barbara Kovats from Solar Power Village Tamera in Portugal's Alentejo; from Richard Nelson and Richard Hogan at Greenfire Farm in Ohio\/USA and many others about Village Innovations that make a difference.\\n* How can we possibly cooperate? Andrew Sandakov und Jean Jebanov from the Russian Republic of Buryatia will issue a call for synchronous coaching and cooperation in rural permaculture - possibly with iPads in the field.\\n* What can we achieve? Kordian Euris will present the amazing development of Open Source Ecology as one example how shared knowledge will enable us to regain our basic values of life.\\n* Where will we end up? Dagmar Eisenbach and John Broomfield will show the case study of Bittlebronn, a bioenergy village in Southwestern Germany that has achieved a lot with a bioenergy plant and is aiming for new horizons in village development. Tony Gwilliam  and Marita Vidal from Bloo Lagoon holiday village will show what village aesthetics can mean to us.\\n\\nWe have a very clear goal, even if the development is still based on individual goodwill and voluntary contributions and the event is self constructing: we want to see a virtual university of the village, a stregnthening stream of knowledge, experience and empowering relations built up and maintained by this media connections which will become habitual in the years to come. If we understand that this is a fourth resource that complements the soil, the water and the sunlight, that we have to install it rigourously and use it primarily to raise our level of autonomy, then the possibilities are endless.\\n\\nWe think that in today's world the village, the local community of people, is a much needed life support system that we rediscover and redesign after the Big Industrial Dream that has turned into a nightmare. And instead of crisis, decay and destruction brought about by the industrial spirit of competition, we seek to lay the base for a truly cooperative world.\\n\\nThe village will be at the centrepiece of this world, playing a similar role in a world society as individuals play in a local society. Villages will be the voluntary associations to realize and manifest values, they will be the convergence point of the cultural communities that are blooming in masses facilitated by the Web. But they will be much more - they will be the microcosm that allows us to digest the manifold offerings of the world in a meaningful and productive way and turn them into an abundant local reality everywhere.\\n\\nI hope we can do our event in this spirit tomorrow. The purpose is also to create a first video documentation about the idea of Global Villages with the help of the material gathered.\\n\\nTechnically, those of you who want to participate are cordially invited - but please mind the fact that we have only 25 slots. We will turn off audio and video interactivity most of the time due to limited bandwidth (you can still watch the stream, just not interact by speaking or video) - Rajah's farm has only a mobile provider connection for the time being. A short and hot presentation can always be squeezed in but we will keep a rough ratio of 16 - 20 presentations with 8-10 online and 8-10 local. We hope that you will be able to see them all.\\n\\nYou can either participate by web-browser or by Skype. Skype is highly recommended.\\n\\nYou will get a link to the form https:\/\/bluejeans.com\/2787801\/xxxx\/skype  (I will send you the PIN later with the schedule).\\n\\nMarkus Petz will be backchannel operator and communicate with you during the event and empowered to be time watchdog and even modify the sequence,\\nWerner Strasser will be online connection and switching operator,\\nDavid R\u00f6thler will be the director of local production,\\nGeorg Pleger will be post production advisor,\\nI (Franz) will do the moderating.\\n\\nPlease make sure you added Skype contact with the following accounts:\\nFranz Nahrada  - skype handle = globalvillagesinfo\\nMarkus Petz - skype handle = vogelfreimarkus\\n\\nIt is highly reccomended that you go online one hour before the interactive part, that means at 10 AM Central European Summertime., so that we can confirm scheduling and are able to handle conectivity.\\n\\nI am looking forward to this challenge!\\n\\nFranz Nahrada\\nGIVE * Lab for Global Villages\\nJedleseer Strasse 75\\nA-1210 Wien\\nwww.give.at\\nwww.globalvillages.org\\nwww.globalvillages.info\\nwww.globalvillages.tv\\nwww.globalvillage.at\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/330479217037701\/\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/338474896240271\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/338474896240271\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-08-10T06:54:13+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-08-10T06:54:13+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_338343989586695\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"\\\"I now have mixed feelings about this trial.

Science everyday pushes more and more many of the truths that humanity is not ready for. This even can relate to the question of whether UFO'S are real and far more intelligent and advanced then we are. The question of fear of whether or not God is real or not is something we humans have not learned to understand by moral standards. What is most sad i find is that many poor souls fear to be themselves because many do not believe in themselves.

Intellectually many of us have passed  beyond fear but retain it in other ways. In this practice in my own life and in sharing it with others, I would like the community to move away from pity (ie \\\"poor souls\\\"), resentment, shame, guilt, or feelings of poor esteem, whether in regards to the self or others, in our accepting and facing whatever fears remain. This process can be an essential step in growth and evolution for many people, and is absolutely still relevant and needed even for the most evolved among us -- something that bears admitting, gently, and not condemnation. Lightworkers, healers, evolutionary agents -- groups I would include myself in -- are full of people who are ashamed to admit the fears they hold on to, because intellectually they understand the illusion of them. This attitude ultimately precludes our ability to truly grow past the point of fear, because we become fearful of acknowledging our fears, particularly publicly. A human(e), gentle opening of process and loving look in at our histories that recognizes our tendency to develop fearful patterns is a beautiful thing for many of us, even the confident among us -- sometimes it is MOST important for the confident among us.

A company would be something held in trust - it's an appropriate term for what's needed in the world.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"100003582463454\",\"name\":\"David\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":98,\"length\":5},{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":196,\"length\":4},{\"id\":\"14935\",\"name\":\"Mark\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":270,\"length\":4}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-06T14:29:12+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"337266143027813\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Eggleton\",\"id\":\"100003582463454\"},\"message\":\"Don't recall if this model\/new reality in USA was mentioned: http:\/\/www.bcorporation.net\/\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-06T14:32:18+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"337267586361002\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Kellden\",\"id\":\"570407302\"},\"message\":\"Irma Wilson that's a great question.

I have one complaint: the media seems to get a 'free pass.' =nearly all The Media (big and small, broadcast, narrow-cast, and self-cast). While American media history begins with broadsides, the penny press, and outrageous hucksterism, the post-WWII period saw the rise of a largely privately owned, mass media, licensed to use the nations spectrum conditionally, i.e. 'responsibly.' Without a clear idea of what that meant, most of it operated in a sort of \\\"middle-of-the-road' mind-set (though there were plenty of religious firebrands and political cranks reaching small audiences here and there).  The mainstream, however, was normalized, and in a normalized medium, its voice seemed largely calm and reasoned. It followed ideas of fairness more closely than the public at large, and created the impression that we were 'basically\\\" good, reasonable people, even when we weren't, everywhere. That is not the case today. And we need to be concerned that ideas like the Verizon-Google hegemony for \\\"renting out\\\" access to the \\\"highest bidder\\\"  and  for \\\"net neutrality\\\" regulation should be such a concern. When PACs or their commercial embodiments (advertisers) can segregate the audience into demographically and ideologically homogeneous cells in which to feed them whatever they want without fear of  contradiction, 'freedom' is lost. Having to have too many versions of the same ad is costly. Having one add that can be served up to as many audiences as you like, with each one perceiving it to in the context of shared values, is highly cost effective and disingenuous.

Even about 5 years ago, when we were buying panels by the container for Australia, the margins were getting tight. With a subsidy driven market there huge swings in demand based purely on the start and end date of subsidies, while supply remained constant - so the price swung up or down depending on whether the aggregate of all the subsidy programs was more than the production capacity at the time. When demand went up, prices swung up to close to the profit margin for the european based integrator. When demand went down, prices swung to the marginal cost of production (to avoid having sunk capital sitting idle.\\n\\nMargins were tight enough that a small swing in currency switched a forward contract from profitable to lossy. At one point we had to delay installations for a couple of months since otherwise every house we installed would have been a loss for us. \\n\\nAlso while governments in some cases closed subsidy programs with as little as 24 hours notice, the lead time on manufacturing capability could be measured in years. \\n\\nI think what we are seeing here is that the decline in some of the subsidies in Europe, and failure of the US to take meaningful action on climate change, has now hit hard. \\n\\n See http:\/\/www.solarbuzz.com\/sites\/default\/files\/facts_figs\/modules_trend_03_0.png for the general shape of the grap, but notice  those are retail prices in US or Europe, wholesale prices are below a watt at the factories in China. \\n\\nOh - and notice the article refers to subsidies for solar, while ignoring the implicit subsidies on fossil fuels & nuclear. Removing ALL subsidies, and making fossil fuels (especially natural gas) pay their true environmental cost & we'd see a much more stable renewables sector.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-05T05:17:59+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzM2ODM5MDk5NzM3MTg0\",\"before\":\"MzM2ODM5MDk5NzM3MTg0\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_336812973073130\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kevin George Haskell\",\"id\":\"100000689883853\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10000872396390444405804577558973445002552.html\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQBPUqM1OrbdGTDu&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fs.wsj.net%2Fpublic%2Fresources%2Fimages%2FRV-AH723_RIDLEY_D_20120803183932.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10000872396390444405804577558973445002552.html\",\"name\":\"How Bias Heats Up the Warming Debate\",\"caption\":\"online.wsj.com\",\"description\":\"A look at new statements by Richard Muller and Anthony Watts. \",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/336812973073130\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/336812973073130\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-08-05T03:17:29+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-08-05T03:17:29+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_336795833074844\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Stephen Hinton\",\"id\":\"1325647857\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"Chris Cook\",\"id\":\"671176264\"},{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Just out!

I was just on Nora Bateson thread another Mom as well as being Gregory Bateson's daughter who is touring world with her excellent documentary about her father's ( in the beginning with his 1st wife Margaret Meade ) research of how we humans operate which is really at base of all we are doing and of course created the AI world\\nthat the REVOLUTION STARTS AT HOME !\\n\\nThe focus of what I do now which incorporates all the many tangents I working on to move society forward into its rightful emergent Place is called \\\" A Hero's Journey to Commitment \\\" to do exactly what U are saying.. People are gumpitizing themselves to fit ideologies and roles that do not exist in reality ! They are just figments of imagination causing much subjective erroneous judgment making walls. \\n\\nAll in life operates from the CORE of person. The Essence is to know well UR own Personal CORE integrity as this is really how one lives a healthy long life... This is the Key to creating a sustainable self therefore building sustainable VITAL communities in which the humans engage as Present People who know selves and are happy proud, of what they are at their CORE. \\n\\nOur world is made of relationships. Our bodies are a dynamic interplay of processes. Even our most personal thoughts arise within an ecology of ideas and context. Science does not describe \u201cthings\u201d but rather changes, patterns, and reciprocity. Simply: Relationships.\\n\\nHumans co-evolve with every creature in nature and with every social context. Our lives are the stories of these relationships. Learning is a dance with a dynamic world. Nora Bateson, daughter of Gregory Bateson and director of the film An Ecology of Mind, and author and Greenpeace International co-founder Rex Weyler did a weekend of synchronizing our lives with nature\u2019s patterns at Esalen June 29- July 1: An Ecology of Relationships in Life, Science and Art: Building the Future Together\\nWith Nora Bateson, Rex Weyler, Ralph Abraham and Nina Wise:\\n\\nMany have posited that in these early years of the 21st century, as we move forward into perceiving the universe not as a collection of distinct and independent parts but as a unified system of interconnected and interrelated beings, that we have the opportunity to be active agents in ushering in a new paradigm.\\n\\nUsing Gregory Bateson\u2019s ideas of communication and relation and Ralph Abraham\u2019s models from chaos theory of paradigm shift, and our own direct experiences with nature and society, we will examine the paradigms that keep us bound to non-sustainable thought patterns. We will liberate habitual patterns and rediscover the creative potential of an ever-changing mind in a changing world.\\n\\nWe\u2019re on a quest for a new kind of thinking before we propose solutions. We need to ask new questions. When Gregory Bateson asked, \u201cWhat is the pattern that connects?\u201d he nudged us to observe relationships and change. Nature is our guide because the patterns of living systems hold the secrets to revitalize human systems, grow healthy communities, and heal our relationships.\\n\\nAn Ecology Of Mind | A Daughter's Portrait of Gregory Bateson\\nhttp:\/\/www.anecologyofmind.com\/\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1205605140\",\"name\":\"Bill Wilkie\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":9,\"length\":11}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-03T13:52:34+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"336295169791577\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bill Wilkie\",\"id\":\"1205605140\"},\"message\":\"Oops, I cheated with 7.

If there are unmet needs and unused skills, and the problem is a lack of money, we ought to be able to bypass that limitation and find another way to meet those needs and employ those skills.\\n\\nTroy's point about capital increasing productivity has merit, except that much of that ability to produce in agriculture, is based on government subsidizes for fuel, corn and soybeans, creating a monoculture world in which many people and other living things no longer have a way to make a living.\\n\\nWe are not opposed to the market. As Troy says, the profti motive is a great incentive to innovation in the system.  It is just that the market is an insufficient mechanism to produce the kind of world we would like to live in.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1341377803\",\"name\":\"Alex\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":20,\"length\":4},{\"id\":\"763074324\",\"name\":\"Troy\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":646,\"length\":4}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-30T23:47:43+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"335167306571030\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Troy Camplin I'm trying to understand what you're saying about catalyzing change but not knowing where it will go, that spontaneous orders and CASs do not have goals that can be imposed, that we cannot predict what will happen in an economy.. Specifically in the case of an economy. Say I saw positive externalities, or complements or whatnot, and I decide one day that I want to help augment positive externalities, or help greatly improve some complement hoping that it will positively effect other technologies, industries, etc. that rely on the complement.. does that mean that we are essentially powerless to try to make an economy \\\"better\\\", if we can't predict what the outcome of our actions will be? That would make sense and would be a good argument against state intervention..\\n\\nIf I put a plug in the bottom of my bathroom sink and run the faucet for cold water, I will get a sink full of cold water.. While statististically that might not happen all the time, but you know what I mean, I know that by doing x I can - usually - achieve y, it is for practical purposes \\\"predictable\\\". But if I want a sink full of cold water, and I can't predict what turning the faucet on will do.. say turning the faucet on could a) make a useless squeaking sound with no water, b) make tomato sauce boil in the kitchen, c) make an alarm clock go off in Peru, and so on.. If I am understanding this correctly, since the action of turning on the faucet has an effect that is unpredictable, then there's really no way for me to \\\"do\\\" that thing that I set out to do, i.e. \\\"make the sink fill up with water\\\"..\\n\\nNow back to the economy, does the fact that we can't predict or know what will happen, that we can not impose goals on it, that there's really nothing we can do to \\\"make it better\\\".. Like in my example, I see a positive externality and say hey let's capitalize on that by implementing some measures of some sort.. that it could totally backfire and not have the desired effect?\\n\\nI'm trying to apply this to markets to understand how digital publishing, say, is great for Amazon or whoever, but bad for paper mills.. but I'm not just seeing competition, I seem to be seeing a great interdependence.. Is there an interdependence or is that a figment of my imagination? It's that gosh-darn \\\"Invisible Hand\\\" I'm struggling with.. when you take agents with rule-based behavior, each following simple rules, then you get that big collective behavior of the \\\"horde\\\" or flock or whatever you want to call it.. I'm just thinking if we want to augment my or your capacity to choose freely.. it's never going to work, it seems to be the nature of the beast, someone might profit from me not profiting, or someone might profit from my profits, or my profits might make someone's enterprise less profitable, etc. There doesn't seem to be a sort of predictable consequence of any single rule-based behavior.. but then magically the collectivity behaves in a manner which favors \\\"most people\\\"?\\n\\nI don't know, my instinct when I try to work this out is just to sit down and DO NOTHING. While doing nothing is still doing something, at least it's something I'm certain I can do!

Every choice you make affects every thing else in the system.  That is what makes it a complex system.  The fact that each element has co-evolved its rules of survival in conjuction with every thing else in the system is what makes it self-organizing and adaptive.  It is a Complex Adaptive System.\\n\\nHowever, there are no externalities.  It is a single system of living things dependent on the physical characteristics of this planet.  I think we can make the economy better by learning how the choices we think of as economic choices are impacting the rest of the system and feeding back into the condition of the economy.\\n\\nTroy promotes the need for an interdisciplinary world.  I agree.  We may not be able to predict all the consequences of a given choice but we are doomed to responding to unintended consequences if we do not, at least, consider how a choice might affect all the other aspects of the system.\\n\\nFor a first step, let's stop spreading poisons.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"763074324\",\"name\":\"Troy\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":38,\"length\":4},{\"id\":\"1341377803\",\"name\":\"Alex\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":44,\"length\":4}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-31T12:52:14+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"335365193217908\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Troy Camplin\",\"id\":\"763074324\"},\"message\":\"Alex, While it is true that one cannot predict the global outcome of your actions -- and on this you are right, this is indeed a strong argument against regulations and general economic interference -- that does not mean you cannot make local predictions or pattern predictions of the overall complex system. Your brain is a complex adaptive system, but we know what will happen if we cut off the oxygen to it, even if we don't know with precision what your next action will be. We cannot know with precision, but if we know you well enough, we can make pattern predictions -- a close friend knows what you tend to do in certain kinds of situations, and won't be surprised if you do indeed act as he predicted. But he also moy be wrong. You may react to that similar situation differently because something happened to you so you're in a different mood, etc. that makes you react differently. \\n\\nThe same is true of the economy. I can predict that if you provide people with cheap money for a given activity, there will be more of that activity -- a bubble. And if something happens such that the money is no longer as cheap, the bubble will burst. For example, if mortgage interest rates are held down below the natural market rate, more people will buy houses, and you will get a housing bubble. If the interest rate goes up, people will stop buying houses -- and this will then hit those building new houses who have their money tied up in housing-specific capital, and you get a downturn as the market tries to reallocate capital (some of which is so housing-specific it cannot be reallocated, meaning it has to be stored in the hopes that housing will return -- which it won't until the market clears once prices reach the floor). We can then apply this to other aspects of the economy. What will cheap money in the form of low-interest student loans cause? Drastically increasing higher education costs. What will cheap money in the form of third-party payers such as insurance (public and private)? Drastically increasing health care costs. And if the third party payer is the government exclusively, and the government is trying to hold down costs, what will you get? Rationing and thus long waits and old equipment. \\n\\nWe can make these pattern predictions, but that does not mean we can therefore control the economy. We know from network theory that in a scale-free network like an economy, if you start taking away links -- indeed, if you redistribute links artificially -- you will eventually get a network collapse. That is the pattern prediction. However, when will that collapse take place? Who knows? You may get a collapse in 10, 20, 50, or 100 years. You cannot know when you are one link-break away from total network failure and collapse. However, we also know that if we allow the network to grow on its own, to create and lose links naturally and semirandomly (they are always only semirandom, because the agents in the network themselves are acting in such a way that one can make pattern predictions, but not full predictions, though they are not truly acting randomly), the such networks are highly robust. \\n\\nSo the bathtub example doesn't work because it's too simple a system! It's a simple system, and thus completely predictable in its actions. \\n\\nComplex systems are more locally than globally predictable, and all such predictions are mere pattern predictions. \\n\\nSo should you act? As one of your countrymen wrote and another sung \\\"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\\\" Your inaction is an action with unforseen and unforseeable consequences. All action is tragic. There will be positive benefits for some and negative consequences for others. Often you won't know who those people are, as your actions' repurcussions spread throughout the world. Your question promoted two answers from two people, each of whom had to think about these things in more detail and thus helped to clarify those ideas. You will read them and consider them both. All three of us will be changed by this interchange in unpredictable ways, with the result that all three will act on them in different ways. \\n\\nSo should you act? You must.

We have rarely engaged\\nourselves in the deeper search, which requires an imagination that explores narratives as long history, the location of whole peoples\u2019 place in local, national, and global history...this notion of spacetime requires that we recognize and build imaginative narrative that has the capacity to link the past and the future rather then force a false choice between them (2005, p.147).\u201d\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-31T00:45:24+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"335168936570867\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\",\"id\":\"1422975257\"},\"message\":\"By rectifying and readjusting our perspective towards the past, we trigger the same neurological mechanisms that enable us to rectify and readjust our future.

One of the major limitations of microfinance is that MFI's are usually regulated out of providing savings so the poor are often left with credit as the ONLY choice.  There are three robust findings in microfinance.  The first Phil Jones mentions above that micro-credit is good for helping to start micro-enterprise.  The second is that micro-credit is good for \\\"consumption smoothing\\\".  This essentially means that if a family hits a financial shock (some one gets sick, drought, earthquake, etc) that micro-credit gives the family what they need to avoid complete destitution. The irony of this is that savings is actually a better way to accomplish this particular goal.  (The third finding is that microfinance does NOT hurt the poor.  In order to get past the hype, this is an important finding.  there is no finding that microfinance fixes poverty.  It is actually a silly question to ask.  However, there is a robust finding that microfinance does not hurt the poor.)\\n\\nSo, back to sequencing.  There are two critical books to understand this 1) Portfolios of the Poor, which demonstrates clearly the the poor have very active and complex financial lives. While the poor need financial education it is not to understand that they need to manage their money, it is to understand how to manage their money using formal financial services.  (This in my mind is the problematic aspect. Retail banking can be responsible service that provides real value; however, financial services seem to all tend to the rapacious archetype.  we need to kill this tendency.) 2) Just Give Money to the Poor, which is a review of Cash Transfer initiatives that demonstrates that just giving money to the poor is very effective at impacting poverty. Successful programs in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and elsewhere confirm this.\\n\\nThe sequence: 1) Cash transfer, 2) Livelihood support\/training, 3) Micro-Savings, 4) Micro-Credit.  This sequence seems to be the ticket.  Each service in the right place.

If we truly understand what wealth is, we will understand it is literally impossible to spread wealth around. You can redistribute money, but wealth is something other than money. Money is merely something with which we are able to efficiently engage in exchange. Certainly, it is far more efficient than what it replaced: barter. But barter really gets at what wealth truly is. When I go to trade one item for another, I am trying to trade the item I have for something I value more. When I find someone who has what I want and who wants what I have, we trade, and each of us is better off. Each is now wealthier. The exchange of money masks this reality, because people think we are trying to accumulate more money. We're not. We're trying to acquire things and services which make our lives better. Better in what way? That is up to us. Better by whose definition? Well, now, there's the stickler. \\n\\nThere are those who think that they are eminently qualified to decide if you or I is better off from our exchanges. If such a person disagrees with our decision, he makes the decisions for us. If he does not like the fact that I provide a good or service that enough people want that they are willing to pay me more than someone else for their good or service, then he will take the money I have accumulated by free exchange with others, and give it to those who have been less successful at providing good and services. In other words, he intends to reward failure and low-value goods and services for being low-value goods and services. He doesn't like the fact that we have decided that one person's goods or services are more valuable than another person's. Thus, he will distribute the money temporarily accumulated by such people as he disapproves of to those the society has already deemed as providing less value to that society. Thus, such a person will not spread the wealth around, but rather reduce the wealth of the country. That is the real consequence of redistributionist policies.\\n\\nThis I think gets at what wealth really is. People accumulate wealth by accumulating bonds -- trading bonds, artistic bonds, educational bonds, etc. I have more education because I have created a lot of bond with a lot of teachers. Thus I have a high degree of educational wealth. The more I read, the more intellectual wealth I accumulate. The more poems I read, the more poetic wealth I accumulate -- which I can then tranform into more poems, or poetic goods, if you will. I thus act as a poetry entrepreneur. I do these things because they profit me. I am driven by the profit motive. Poetry profits me, and I wrote poems I hope will profit others. If my poems profit others, they will be read and re-read. I must provide a good product if people are going to want to read my poems. My good product must profit them. As they accumulate profit, they accumulate wealth. One's wealth grows as you accumuate those things (losely understood) that profit us.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-29T20:57:47+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"334784353275992\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"So as a side-note, advances in medicine that have led to lower infant mortality rates, or other amenities that lead, say, to greater general quality of life in a society.. those things would factor into the \\\"Wealth\\\" of that society, right?

What danah boyd has written about social media, social grooming, and maintaining peripheral social awareness? I began asking myself long ago what Foucault would think about blogging and social media and I came to different conclusions. For instance, Professor Wesch brings up the work of Erving Goffman on face and face-work, which I find extremely relevant to the question at hand. Plus Goffman also wrote much about \\\"total institutions\\\", of which the Panopticon would certainly be an example. Sharing as performance, creative self-affirmation, subjectivation, etc., comes off to me as a superficial analysis of social media. I don't mean superficial in a pejorative sense, I mean that the question of sharing and identity seems to me at least to be a surface reading of what's going on, like stating the obvious. That doesn't mean it's not significant, it was articulated beautifully in any case. What I'd like to see is a deeper reading of how discourse has changed with the advent of blogging and social media. One could also look at the collective performance and see how it serves to promote civic virtues, which I would argue tends to go against authentic self-affirmation and identity formation. Finally, I wonder what McLuhan would say about it as well. Is social media a hot or cold media? Depending on the answer, what do we know to be true about such media? I would argue that social media is in fact not very participatory. It's closer to an experience of passive consumption. But anyway I'm just a random insane guy, so what do I know? The three-part series was a great read.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-27T05:20:43+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"333932176694543\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\",\"id\":\"578568173\"},\"message\":\"Thanks Alex Lavigne-Gagnon 'I'd like to see is a deeper reading of how discourse has changed with the advent of blogging and social media'.

In the meantime, I wanted to ask, are you familiar with Pierre Bourdieu's book Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste? And what are your thoughts on Evolutionary Aesthetics?\\n\\nBeauty is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about.. I have some concerns.. I wonder too about moral character and the liberal arts.. (In passing, whenever I think of the Liberal Arts, I'm reminded of Steve Jobs saying that Apple sat \\\"at the intersection of the liberal arts and technology.\\\")\\n\\nFor a concrete example to express some of my concerns, I take Facebook.. More and more I am seeing Facebook as a technology for \\\"promoting the civic virtues\\\".. where you're basically outcast if you transgress the numerous \\\"norms\\\", which are civic virtues.. My equation would be \\\"Facebook = civic humanism\\\".. which worries me.. I worry about what the \\\"right actions\\\" are in a place like Facebook (which we could call a \\\"Third Place\\\").. I'm worried about social media in general as a Third Place where you have to be nice, you have to be kind, you have to be generous, you have to believe in cooperation and win-win situations, the list of \\\"musts\\\" in social media is a long list, the \\\"imperatives\\\" that one must follow lest one be cast out..\\n\\nI think that this is having the opposite effect, actually going against the goal of said \\\"civic humanism\\\".. I'm trying to make this brief, so I'm skipping steps in the argument.. I just think there's a lot of bad faith.. and that we are forcing ourselves to give what I call \\\"beautiful signals\\\".. Since this is a communication medium, what I call \\\"language media\\\", I look at our \\\"actions\\\" as mostly consisting of \\\"signals\\\". You hear a lot about \\\"signal\\\" in social media.. the proverbial \\\"signal-to-noise ratio\\\".. everyone is trying to cut down on \\\"noise\\\", i.e. information pollution, information noise, and trying to augment \\\"signal\\\".. but in the process. we're cutting out actual people..\\n\\nI've seen this behavior in Facebook Groups before, someone posting something like, \\\"I'm leaving this group because there's too much noise..\\\" The person in question seemed to be expressing that the group had too many posts that were not relevant to him, that the group was too \\\"noisy\\\".. When I saw this, I was troubled.. The group was full of people trying to spark discussions, there was a lot of discussion, often great discussions, lots of people eager to meet others, find out about their projects, much like what goes on in The Next Edge.. But to this one person, all of this was \\\"noise\\\".. but what was it? I concluded that I myself had become a \\\"noise\\\".. and so I bring it back to the civic virtues and Facebook in general..\\n\\nIf I do not promote the civic virtues, I am a \\\"noise\\\".. that pollutes the \\\"signal\\\".. If I do not follow the \\\"rules\\\", if I transgress the \\\"norms\\\", I am noise, I am in fact \\\"Ugly\\\".. hence the name I came up with of \\\"beautiful signals\\\".. I say that we tend to look for \\\"beautiful signals\\\", signals that signal all good things, health, the Good, Beauty, Truth \/ The True.. and anything that doesn't fit our ideal of the Good, the True, the Beautiful, is ugly, is noise, is pollution.. dirty nasty crap we need to get rid of.. i.e. the world has enough crap as it is, is polluted enough, we don't need this \\\"critter\\\", this \\\"disease\\\" in our network.. we want to avoid the \\\"spread\\\" of this human \\\"virus\\\".. stupid silly nasty ugly noisy crap.. My point is that we're talking about actual PEOPLE, INDIVIDUALS.. and that \\\"cutting\\\" people out, is bad.. it's bad faith, it's living in a Filter Bubble.. it's homophily.. it's also the basis of bigotry, racism, hatred..\\n\\nSo to me civic humanism is evil, it goes against its own stated purpose.. promoting the civic virtues, and Saving Face itself, for the sake of Saving Face, is also an \\\"evil\\\", a \\\"lesser evil\\\" perhaps, but an \\\"evil\\\" nonetheless..

I can't imagine someone in \\\"polite society\\\" who hasn't heard people talking about \\\"those welfare bums\\\", \\\"those crazies\\\".. in the name of moral superiority, moral righteousness.. My solution is to stop thinking in terms of \\\"us vs. them\\\" when we speak of the Government, of politicians, bankers, etc.. i.e. the 99% vs the 1%.. and start addressing the \\\"us vs. them\\\" problems that we face in our everyday lives living with one another, living amongst supposed \\\"equals\\\"..

In environments where individuals are at arms length and actual social connection is weak, then the phenomena you are describing will happen and, frankly, will be common.  But in more tightly connected communities, it is typical to take people for who they are - in moralities that seem shocking even to us.  I'm thinking about tribal societies, but even something as modern as the communities of sharecroppers in the early 20th century fits the bill.  Ever read \\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\\"?  Tom Joad comes back from prison as a murderer - but the community understands the contextuality of his crime and welcomes him back.  Same for the preacher who just can't keep away from the 'sins of the flesh'.  \\n\\nThe coming society will, I think, be far closer to the latter than the former.  In many ways we are currently in the most atomized and arms-length position that humankind has ever or will ever achieve.

When my dad was a kid, they too had bullies, intimidation.. but nowadays kids are literally killing one another.. ruthless beatings are quite common.. even when I was a kid, we had bullies, intimidation, but not these kinds of violent beatings..

That we are moving towards more \\\"tightly connected communities\\\"? Also, I'm not saying it's the private clubs and elitist tribes who are excluding the ugly and the crazy, unless you want to see society as a whole as a private club \/ elitist tribe.. If we take The Next Edge as an example, I think it's closer to an aristocracy of yore.. the kind of aristocracy that Soren Kierkegaard criticized so harshly..

I don't want to bore people with long threads about Nietzschean ressentiment, Sartrean bad faith, or more particularly, bore people with Kierkegaard's philosophy.. worse than that, my instinct is to take it back to Kant's Critique of Judgment, since I was talking about aesthetic judgments, judgments of beauty, taste..

The Uplift Academy Partnership has provided a smorgasbord of alternatives to 100 households with unemployed workers. The projects began in late 2013 with custom design of \u201cpersonal learning networks\u201d in response to each household\u2019s reskilling and educational aspirations. These included on-demand learning, individualized work-study projects, and \u201copen badge\u201d certifications to help members enter into new actual and virtual markets or into Do-It-Yourself opportunities.  A popular track for households in the initial 18 month trial consisted of acquiring skills to lower living costs.  Among the best-received offerings were microfarming, alternative energy solutions, shared use of 3D printers, and new wellness\/health practices.  In return for the custom learning programs, participating households agreed to share a portion of earnings from success in finding employment or launching businesses in related fields, in budget savings from reduced food, energy or other household costs, and\/or an agreed share of future home value gains through \u201cco-ownership mortgages.\u201d   The agreement specifies that municipally owned properties \u2013 at mutually agreed locations \u2013 can be transferred in the future as a land grant endowment to the Uplift Academy Partnership.
