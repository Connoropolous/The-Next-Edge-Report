The answer to the former is that I'm not sure. The answer to the latter, in our own decade-and-a-half of R&D, really does come down to the 6 assumptions of the Pollyanna Principles. Tons of variations on them, lots of sub-assumptions, but between a pretty in-depth study of history (social) and modern psychology and neuroscience (individual), repeatedly we come back to those 6 assumptions as the root of the \\\"moving forward\\\" assumptions.  \\n\\nWhat has amazed us - really and truly - from the time we finally condensed things into those 6 principles is that we haven't yet found a 7th (some people add the quote from the book - \\\"Unless something is physically impossible, it is possible\\\" as a 7th, but I still think that fits into \\\"We are creating the future every day, with everything we do, whether we do so consciously or not\\\". But that again is nuance...)\\n\\nPart of the reason for my monthly podcast has been to challenge \/ add to those assumptions. For 3 years I have interviewed change leaders from around the world, asking the same question over and over - \\\"When you see change happening, what factors do you see undergirding that change?\\\" And to the one, from grassroots groups to policy wonks in high levels of government and all in between, the answers fit in with those 6 assumptions.\\n\\nWhich is leading me to invite this group (and oh my that would be fun - I hope some of you will play, and I'm thinking it should be another thread - I don't want to commandeer this conversation) - to either challenge those assumptions, or add to them, or deconstruct them to see what the subsets are.

Futurism is looking increasingly like a fool's paradise...\\\"  This strikes me as a fundamental that we should spend some time on.  To wit: what are our timelines and what forces (both human and inhuman) conspire to shape those timelines?  \\n\\nWhat assumptions are being made to drive these models?  \\n\\nWhat consequences to strategy and behaviour follow from the models?\\n\\nBy example, as Bret and I have discussed IRL, we share some similar assumptions about core forces (climate disruption, peak cheap oil, economic crisis) and what these entail for the world-as-we-know-it (hint: it aint a pretty picture).  Yet, due to what I presume are some additional and different core models, we have some disagreement about short term trajectory and optimal strategies.  \\n\\nWhile my own models don't originally stem from Seb Paquet's, I find his articulation of \\\"civilization dynamics\\\" at http:\/\/emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\/how-social-movements-happen-part-i-zenith-oss useful.   A crucial assumption that I make is that social psychology operates similar to individual psychology - it prefers to stick to a model it knows rather than leap into the unknown, even if the model it knows isn't working and that only a relatively substantial trauma can cause it to kick into \\\"explore new territory mode\\\".  *But that* once in explore new territory mode, it can deploy pattern discovery and creative destruction mechanisms that are almost unthinkable while in \\\"everything is peachy\\\" mode.  \\n\\nConsequently, I anticipate (and to some extent look forward to ) a large scale crisis similar in both shape and consequence to an alcoholic's hitting rock bottom (see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crisis#Definition_of_a_crisis) at which point *and only at which point* we (collectively) will become capable of rallying to the level of change that is necessary (and, hopefully,  sufficient) to deal with the serious dangers we face. \\n\\nSecondarily, I make the assumption that there are \\\"in the present\\\" instruments and ideas that are fundamentally \\\"of the future\\\" in the sense that they are part and parcel of the solution and not the problem.  \\\"Edge networking\\\" is a classic example.  These resources serve the dual function of hastening the collapse of the old system (ideally well in advance of a point where the rot is so severe that this collapse leads to a much larger species-extinction event) *and* serving as the \\\"scaffolding\\\" for the new model.  \\n\\nIn this context, my strategy is to:\\n\\na) Diagnose the ongoing crisis in an effort to identify \\\"singularity points\\\" (e.g., the tipping point where Mubarak goes from unassailable to fucked)\\n\\nb) Identify the scaffolding and attempt to interpolate what the other pieces of the future model will look like\\n\\nc) Assist in the formation of the new model - with an eye towards attempting to both make it the best that it can be and (recognizing that crisis often turns out badly) that the good future is more likely than the many potential bad futures.\\n\\nd) Focusing on being prepared to act decisively when the tipping point hits, recognizing that there is an almost infinite force multiplier to be found here. \\n\\nWhat say we all?\",\"message_tags\":{\"0\":[{\"id\":\"82300937\",\"name\":\"Bret Weinstein\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14}],\"895\":[{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":895,\"length\":10}]},\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQChaK1NsrLTRynD&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgetfile2.posterous.com%2Fgetfile%2Ffiles.posterous.com%2Ftemp-2011-02-21%2FhGkCBzFHeJeAsAaIvrEEgfDpEDsdkGqcJDBDDwxbmbmvyghpgCqpccBfBclp%2Fsprouts_pave_1.jpg.thumb100.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\/how-social-movements-happen-part-i-zenith-oss\",\"name\":\"How Social Movements Happen, Part I: Zenith, Ossification, Reality Shock, Emergence - EMERGENT CITIE\",\"caption\":\"emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\",\"description\":\"the model would be even better if it could account for the underlying causes in the collision between the development of the means of production (e.g. Internet) and the dominant mode of production (e.g. the private expropriation of humankind's natural and noospheric commons resources)\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yz\/r\/StEh3RhPvjk.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/216617898425972\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/216617898425972\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-01-11T10:39:36+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-01-17T17:38:45+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"736215096\",\"name\":\"Gideon Rosenblatt\"},{\"id\":\"520927385\",\"name\":\"Gunther Sonnenfeld\"},{\"id\":\"592310873\",\"name\":\"James Tyrrell\"},{\"id\":\"726263503\",\"name\":\"Michael Maranda\"},{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\"},{\"id\":\"1068899547\",\"name\":\"Mimi Hall\"},{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"536626881\",\"name\":\"Floris Koot\"},{\"id\":\"614376150\",\"name\":\"Hayden Mills\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"810528543\",\"name\":\"Jan Gordon\"},{\"id\":\"14935\",\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\"},{\"id\":\"828553957\",\"name\":\"PJ Manney\"},{\"id\":\"554482123\",\"name\":\"Kurt Laitner\"},{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\"},{\"id\":\"716245883\",\"name\":\"Kristin Alford\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzE2MjQ1ODgz\",\"before\":\"NzM2MjE1MDk2\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"216641461756949\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Marilyn Mehlmann\",\"id\":\"588329139\"},\"message\":\"'Futurism' is not one thing.

This is a perfectly legitimate question and one that should be closely considered.   \\n\\nMy take (based on some knowledge and much conjecture) is that the powers that be are entirely aware of future scenarios that involve various flavor of resource conflict at a global level (there are many internal debates about what those resource conflicts will look like).  The most important strategy is based on the recognition that of the worlds 7 billion people, roughly 1 billion are extremely at risk and 3 billion are very at risk in the case of significant resource conflict.  Of these 4 billion only a small percentage live in Western Europe or the United States.  Consequently, most of the strategy orbits around what it takes to insulate the US (and key allies) from the various consequences of a major global culling.  This includes tighter policing controls within the US (particularly to safeguard against domestic terror targets) and much higher abilities to take out unconventional targets on a global level.  Fundamentally, there is an assumption that the US can \\\"close ranks\\\" and suffer only civil liberty and lifestyle changes (say a 30% reduction in standard of living) even as billions are starving in the 3rd world.  \\n\\nI do not believe that models of larger scale collapse - i.e., as the result of reverse network effects - are broadly contemplated, and that most contingency plans are an intensification of the current trajectory.   \\n\\nSo much for the deliberate.  It is really the unintended that is crucial here - after all, Von Hindenburg presumably thought he knew what he was doing before things jumped the rails in Weimar.  This is as much legal as memetic.  \\n\\nSuffice it to say that for me the question is strategic: I assume an increase in irrationalism, the legitimization of violence and polarization until the tipping point has been reached - at which point the die is cast and we see how it plays out.  \\n\\nMy internal probabilities: I'm about 30%  optimistic scenario and 70% pessimistic scenario.

Not to paint too dirty a picture, it reminds me of the wealthy jews who thought that their money could protect them from the Nazis during the tipping point in Germany.  You can pay Blackwater to guard you only so long as you are in a unique position to provide them with something they want (and can't simply take from you).

While there are authoritarians and fascists in both communities, the latter (particularly the officer corps) are *substantially* more healthy than the former.

In essence, buttressing averts the more binary constructs tied to \\\"if\/then\\\" or \\\"better than\\\" scenarios, or \\\"new models\\\" that require scaffolding of any kind. Buttressing supports human walls that are created regardless of moral or secular or idealogical ambiguities, or those which might have hierarchical schemes, either fear-based and\/or knowledge based. Buttressing actions contingency groups that don't just subvert \\\"higher authority\\\" movements, but those that also form out of chaos \u2014 vis-a-vis Monti Di Pieta or a favorite amongst this group, Junto. \\n\\nHow buttressing is leveraged in a technological or an Elysian sense I haven't quite thought through (nor could I \u2014 this would likely become a construct built through a cooperative), but I will say that it focuses on emergence as having interjective qualities, rather than simpler measures that induce \\\"macro\\\" or \\\"micro\\\" or \\\"subtle\\\" or \\\"radical\\\" patterns that affect an intentional result, or a future, to embrace complexity. Allow me to provide some context, and use money (and it's future state - another favorite topic here) as an example of how model-free duality drives the commercial world we currently inhabit... For good and for worse.\\n\\nSince Jordan referred to the Jewish fortress of mercantilists who paid for protection during (and before and after) the Holocaust, I will start there. Some of you know that my father is a Holocaust survivor (born in Upper Silesia in 1932 and fled near Auschwitz to Shanghai in 1938). Many cite Kristallnacht as the tipping point in the war, but this probably only served as an affront to Austrian parliament, since Germany was undergoing a reformation of sorts and bankers on either side were torn by, among other things, secularism. Plans were likely made well before WWI to support the \\\"system\\\" and to find figureheads to run it \u2014 independently of the moral or even economic implications \u2014 and to boot, many, many Jews were a part of this accidental regime. (I know, my grandfather and my great grandfather were among them).\\n\\nWhat happened immediately following the release of  Morgenthau's \\\"Politics Among Nations\\\"? Isreal was formed in 1948. What ensued has been a litany of progressive leanings on all sides, all in the name of money. Yet, the \\\"power structure\\\" hangs in the balance, as the Israeli fortress (not exactly a system of any kind) requires funding from US banks to the tune of $58B per year. Was Zionist movement in the West Bank the tipping point? I doubt it.\\n\\nLet's move on to Cuba. Many cite Playa Giron as the \\\"secret tipping point\\\" of The Bay of Pigs invasion (an \\\"invasion\\\" that was spread and hedged over years of political grooming) and the U.S.'s apparent failure to build an \\\"emerging democracy nation-state\\\".  Then of course, there were rumors that this Castro-run state was run by organized crime \u2014 you know, \\\"the Italians\\\". But we all know that mercantile bankers \u2013 Jews and Gentiles alike, some Muslims \u2013 were the string-pullers in a society funded by experimentation, and, aghast, to this day, Cuba hosts one of the most anonymously subsistent economies, as well as one of the highest literacy rates and lowest rates of infectious disease in the world (save for long-standing cultural mores, but that is fodder for another conversation\u2026)\\n\\nTo hark back to a previous point in history, do we honestly believe that Monti Di Pieta was funded by \\\"radical\\\" or \\\"puritanical\\\" or \\\"progressive\\\" Christian sects? Hardly. The lenders were Jews \u2013 later Italian Jews \u2013 who backed both sides of the marketplace until regimes such as Luther's found some major cracks in the \\\"power structure\\\" and shifted things towards a neo-facist or neo-feudalist state.\\n\\nWas a student revolt a tipping point for Tiananmen Square?\\nHow 'bout the Berlin Wall?\\nDo we think these \\\"singular\\\" power structures have ever existed in Tunisia? Egypt? Syria?\\n\\nMy larger point is this: Human intention is intended to be misguided. Our role within the edges, it seems to me, is to buttress transitional movements that transcend the \\\"alternatives\\\" or what amount to \\\"the replacements\\\". Duality is the ideaology that the edges degrade and then move us toward collective, or cooperative intention.\\n\\nMy larger belief is this: 'we' are inherently stronger than 'them' because greed has always had its limitations. And it's the ability to see through the \\\"eyes of the other side\\\" that allows us to be spiritually and mentally free, whether our wealth is material, immaterial, concordant or recursive. Operationally, I liken this to much of what Mark Frasier has advocated around NGOs, but I would add that greed and enlightenment share in recursive values that ultimately bend with fluid, focused contingencies \u2014 people who have suffered through geolocal context (war, admonition, injustice, etc.) but who truly believe in the 'we'.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-17T05:29:07+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"220199194734509\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Gunther Sonnenfeld\",\"id\":\"520927385\"},\"message\":\"...

I spoke with the woman managing the project to create a sustainability major within the business school.  She liked the idea of thrivability but struggled to understand it fully enough to propose it in some way.  She asked if I could send her something to support her.  I sent her a few local resources (the Thrivability Montreal website, my TEDx) and  then sent this email: \\n\\n\\\"Our conversation about how to optimize the societal relevance and impact of the major centered around a few related topics: \\n\\n* Integrating a living systems perspective of organizations, communities and economies. This is at the heart of what we're calling \\\"thrivability.\\\"  There is a growing body of academic research in this area (Margaret Wheatley, Peter Senge, Otto Scharmer, others). \\n\\n* Incorporating reflective and interactive teaching methods. This is related to the living systems perspective, which views learning as a living process. Again, there are an increasing number of existing academic models to study (KaosPilots, Knowmads and TeamAcademy are among the most pioneering). \\n\\n* Exploring the overarching goal of the program in the context of global circumstances. As one colleague of mine [Venessa Miemis] put it, \\\"What is the big, hairy question that the major will position itself to answer?\\\"  \\n\\nThe first two points above can be tackled at various levels of scale and commitment:\\n\\n* You could dedicate one class within an existing course to living systems perspectives.  You could dedicate an entire course to the topic.  Or you could explore how that view could color and shape the entire major. \\n\\n* You could introduce a reflective, interactive, immersive experience at both the beginning and end of the four year program. Or you could explore ways to pull that methodology through the whole program. \\n\\nFor inspiration on the third point, I'll copy below the opening text from the draft manifesto for the Solarium (our project to house and nurture a community of thrivable organizations in Montreal). \\n\\n....\\n\\nWe are working to usher in a new guiding story about what it means to be human, alive and at work and play in the world. \\n\\nThis new story recognizes organizations, communities and economies as living systems, each nested within the living biosphere, each with the potential to thrive if given the proper fertile conditions. \\n\\nAt its core, then, the story encourages us to align how we do things with what we know about how living systems thrive.  It invites us: \\n\u00b7         To re-conceive and re-craft our organizations so that they are not only sustainable but thrivable \u2013 full of creativity, collaboration, resilience, impact and joy. \\n\\n\u00b7         To re-imagine ourselves not as consumers, not as \\\"human capital,\\\" but as vibrant contributors to the whole of life.\\n\\n\u00b7         To restructure the artifacts and architecture of society so that they support wiser, more life-affirming ways of being. \\n\\nOur goal, then, is to bring this story \u201cto life,\u201d grounded in local context but with global reach.   \\n\\nIn this way, every organization, every community, every city will come to be designed intentionally as a \u201cspace for life.\u201d\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-11-09T23:09:40+0000\",\"like_count\":4,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"370990566322037\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\",\"id\":\"100001413664942\"},\"message\":\"There was a closed meeting yesterday to discuss the sustainability major.

Now, because the current chaotic environment makes it difficult to predict what initiatives will turn out to be useful, a combination of personal passion and personal risk-taking seem to be called for.\\n\\nI personally believe chances of success are enhanced when you manage to have access to good advice, get very capable people, and find ways for them to gradually develop their skills and build confidence in themselves and in the team. Being part of a \u2018Scenius\u2019 (the collective form of genius) is a killer way to obtain these affordances.\\n\\nA scenius is more like an ecosystem or a city than an organism or corporation. It can incubate projects and organizations, but is not really an organization. In this day and age, I suspect it can actually stay alive longer than most of the projects or organizations it generates.\\n\\nI think I basically want to be part of a scenius, and I think this very group, The Next Edge, is a coherent scene that foreshadows the nature of an emerging \u2018online scenius\u2019.

If we can pull off a few small capers, maybe we can challenge ourselves to pull off something more ambitious... you get my drift.\\n\\nEngaging in small projects has many benefits. Some obvious ones are learning and getting to know potential collaborators better (both of which are sure shots, even if the project fails). Engaging in small projects that Just Could Get Big (Cause You Never Know) might be a way to conduct modest-risk experiments towards real impact.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: given the diversity, collective knowledge and wisdom, and quality of engagement of people in this group, I don\u2019t find it difficult to imagine that it could turn into a decent launchpad for promising initiatives, and I believe we should think a bit about this.

Examples are Deliberative Polling\u00ae, GitHub, amongst others. Personally I like what the MIT Center for Civic Media is working on.\\n\\nhttp:\/\/civic.mit.edu\/projects\\n\\nThere are other subgroups within the Greater Next edge (GNE) working on other things. I happen to be part of those interested in building the platform needed if we can't find it. Harlan T Wood is working on Software_Zero, Glistening Deepwater has a series of websites putting together vast amounts of resources\/intellectual capital.\\n\\nThe main idea seems to be that Facebook is failing us, in fact, any platform that does not allow the creation of a true knowledge base or repository is pointless to use. LinkedIn has had groups and conversations going for years and thousands of pages long and the data is stuck in a silo. Searching and navigating the conversations is difficult..\\n\\nThere are others working on other projects, because what I mention isn't a panacea to cure all ills. It's just to say that I've observed the same thing, what I've been calling the failure of collaboration.\\n\\nTask management and project management solutions have been tested. We are putting together preliminary insights\/reviews. Others also have their hands full with real projects \\\"on the ground\\\" and cannot invest hours of time contributing to stuff online. That is partly why the repository idea would be fruit-bearing, because those people could browse\/navigate through conversations.. and not just conversations, but conversations, debates, dialogues that have already been processed, refined, 'mined', in a kind of peer-review process.\\n\\nFacebook makes it hard to find stuff. Findability and Discoverability is next to nil. It's very noisy. I have been building my own model of how Facebook Groups work - not based on how it works archtiecturally or how Facebook designed Groups, but how I see a flock of people using this particular group and how I see it failing everyday in real-time.\\n\\nFor instance. Seb Paquet started a conversation recently asking about people.. um wait.. see I can't find it.. anyway someone asked something and then Seb and others were making a list of people, maybe SuperHeroes or something or specific fields, domains, specific 'parts' of the whole.. a list of people doing sh*t. Now why can't I hyperlink that conversation into this conversation as a reference? In fact, to be quite honest, I had to scroll up just now to verify what thread I was actually in.. I'm in about 50 different Facebook Groups and get 20 Group notifications per hour, sometimes less, sometimes much more.. I don't even know what thread I am posting in anymore, or where it was I read something.. This is Facebook, it dilutes things, it makes things fuzzy, it is not designed for persistence in discussions or debates, dialogue.\\n\\nPart of it can be solved by people adopting some process or methodology. Good luck with that. Even if we already had the perfect platform, we'd still have the adoption problem. We'd have to make it 'designed-for-adoption' first and foremost, or else we'd never get everyone using it.. So there are many paradoxes involved and many people trying to solve them.\\n\\nI'd say the vast majority of members of this group either never even read the threads or rarely engage in them, or if they engage, it's just to shoot the sh*t, discuss things, and not solve problems.\\n\\nA good number of people I would call experts. Call them the household philosophers. They read through threads and either flip them around or reverse-engineer lines of thought, break down barriers and debunk myths, distortions, biases.. Together they maybe form the Conceptual Clearinghouse..\\n\\nMany are also invested in the funding\/sustainability\/gathering of resources part. Those people are rarely at the forefront. You won't see someone offering to fund a project on Facebook very often. There are a bunch of people not on Facebook involved with people that are on Facebook. Zaq Mosher has been going in that direction with the Colaboratori, leveraging networks on-the-ground etc. Some are just on Twitter also.. some have migrated to Google+. Anyway I've said enough, I hope I'm not totally in the wrong ballpark, or in the wrong thread again.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"668410120\",\"name\":\"Sam Rose\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":8},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":339,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"604081563\",\"name\":\"Harlan T Wood\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":997,\"length\":13},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1040,\"length\":20},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":2607,\"length\":10},{\"id\":\"669842574\",\"name\":\"Zaq Mosher\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":4575,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-29T01:34:31+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"355603297860764\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"id\":\"1063904902\"},\"message\":\"Found yesterday via my network.

A lot of things were in flow in that period. Somebody essentially donated a building, on the beach in Venice, California, for whatever world changing activities I and a group of friends could come up with.  Global Solutions was the name of the place. John Perry Barlow spoke at the opening. Each day was kind of a magical string of synchronicities, people just walking in from the street with projects, answers, solutions, funding, and everything sort of worked out as a gift economy, even while big, ambitious projects were being worked on. There were art shows, salons, dialogue groups, etc. Somebody owing somebody a favor got us a free T1 line (very expensive in those days) and a small server farm. But, well, however fondly I remember the Synchronicity Vortex, as some people still call it, other things didn't really work in a sustainable way about it. There were some personality clashes, intrigues. And despite that things usually worked out in the last minute, there was a continuous black cloud of money trouble hovering close by. I still had to pay rent and take care of my family, and I didn't do that in any very exemplary manner, as my attention was elsewhere.  So, eventually it fell apart, and I went back to concentrating on doing freelance computer work for others. Oh, and moved to another country, I guess, to break the boredom. But I feel a slight bit ashamed of living a more mainstream life now than what I otherwise was aiming for.

I wrote this jic it is of some help. Everything started as a UN consultant on development projects, that took me to many countries and change agents, most of the time in isolated regions without intelectual and professional support. Those experiences were decisive to devote myself to support change agents and, through them, their poor communities. Just from the beginning I use to go in consultancy with my wife, even sometimes with our children. Once back at home we were all full of touching memories, and a compromise to remote-supporting those friends left behing. \\n\\nFinally, I left consultancy, some ten years ago, and became a full-time e-volunteer, researcher, trainer, coach, facilitator, curator of web resources, etc. This experience, that could be seen as straighforward, was actually full of uncerainty and anxieties, but the decisive factors were my family support and the networked friends. We are all firm believers that supporting change agents is a path to social change, and many of my fellow change agents are walking similar paths, becoming trainers and leaving me time to be mainly a researcher. I can say that the last 10 years have been just great for us.\\n\\nSome lessons: family involvement, networking with your like-minded change agents, devote yourself to those friends, become a researcher, R&D researcher, theory into action researcher, action researcher and learning, life-long learner, explore always some e-consultancies, there are always many, become a trainer, facilitator, curator, etc, explore all possible ways to keep you informed and networked, become a full-time e-volunteer, declare proudly yourself as such, enjoy your family life.

Maybe that is due to my style (an introvert who observes, feels and \u201cmulls\u201d over stuff, finding this a worthwhile and informative activity). And now realizing that I would like to share some of the experience \u2013 solitary reflection after a while becomes simply that: lonely, tinged with a little sadness of life not being fully expressed. Here goes \u2026\\n \\nWhat is this group or this experience? How do I find myself perceiving it (them, us)?\\nSo far: A group process, an opportunity to observe and experience all manner of pretty wild group dynamics, an experiment, a platform to self-observe for my own reactions of agreement, irritation, boredom, resonance, stimulation, technological limitations etc.  Useful nudges, clarifications, obfuscations and some brilliant moments of inspiration, occasional affirmation and convergence.\\n \\nA place of wonderment: Who ARE these people, and do they have a day  job, given all the writing they do here? If they do, what is it, and do they ever sleep? Who ARE these people, seeming that some know each other and share bonds from somewhere outside of this platform, there is a deeper familiarity. Who ARE these people, given that some clearly are accorded significantly higher status than others, for reasons that usually are less than transparent, at least to me. Who ARE these people, most of whom are clearly smart, and some of whom speak in dialects of thinking and slang quite seriously unfamiliar.\\nTechnology, over wide parts of the conversation, seems to have a position of high importance, sometimes that of a savior-like capacity: If humans cannot conquer all, maybe technology can or must.\\nA process of figuring out how to get a word in edge-wise in the sheer quantity and speed of things \u2013 how does one interact here, anyway? What are the rules for turn-taking and contribution? Who listens to whom and why and how, and what for?\\nAnd again, who ARE these people here, what for and why? Hard to figure out in the multitude of conversations. STOP!!! I am stepping back. Disengaging becomes a survival strategy \u2013 a necessary withdrawal from overwhelm. ALL of this is just not possible. Sorry folks, I still have a day-job, tell me if you have a cool idea for a direct route on becoming independently wealthy.\\nThen, re-approachment, some curiosity, some longing. Selection-processes: Who would I like to have a fuller connection with? I miss the personal, the context-rich communication. I also miss the more intimate work of actually building something together, figuring out a common direction, a creation, a \u201cforward\u201d \u2013 a commitment to a shared journey, at least for a while. I don\u2019t know how the transitions work here from just talking to closer bonds, to manifesting. Should I even be looking for that here?\\n \\nWhat IS this, here?\\n \\nI wonder if this the current summary of the Next Edge for me: The articulation of longing for deeper connection? Knowing now that, basically, I am not as by myself in thinking about all kinds of \u201cstuff\u201d as I had surmised before (for which I am very grateful), it appears that the Next Edge is making the desire for deeper connection, community and quality dialogue all the more tangible, noticeable, present.\\n \\nI have a guest bedroom in Colorado, good access to mountain hiking and skiing, a nice back yard. Anyone care to visit? Maybe take a few days, and happen to change the world?\\n \\nSabine Amend, 27 December 2011\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/209552615799167\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/209552615799167\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2011-12-30T16:41:04+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2011-12-31T16:08:41+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"100000933562785\",\"name\":\"Lyre Calliope\"},{\"id\":\"684550477\",\"name\":\"Dante-Gabryell Monson\"},{\"id\":\"541176492\",\"name\":\"Gunter Wehmeyer\"},{\"id\":\"817210174\",\"name\":\"Jonathan Sundqvist\"},{\"id\":\"317775\",\"name\":\"Bal\u00e1zs Lazlo Karafi\u00e1th\"},{\"id\":\"100001056194072\",\"name\":\"Kate Michi Ettinger\"},{\"id\":\"776229953\",\"name\":\"Suzie Graham\"},{\"id\":\"1089740462\",\"name\":\"Lauren Higgins\"},{\"id\":\"568507010\",\"name\":\"Anne Caspari\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"511572735\",\"name\":\"Flemming Funch\"},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\"},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\"},{\"id\":\"100003036058797\",\"name\":\"Mark Mercer\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"},{\"id\":\"569844692\",\"name\":\"Madeleine Lansky\"},{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NTIwNjg1NzM2\",\"before\":\"MTAwMDAwOTMzNTYyNzg1\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"209719945782434\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"I *loved* this, Sabine. I think most people have a similar experience of the Next Edge to yours, except that some people do not re-engage after the initial overwhelm. \\n\\nAbous status. Some in this group have been in a 'next edge' mindspace and seeking (and sometimes finding) the others online for a looong time. Heck, Flemming Funch launched a 'New Civilization Network ' in the pre-Google days! (http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/19970126100756\/http:\/\/www.newciv.org\/worldtrans\/newcivnet.html) So there are bonds of familiarity between some people that  go way back and resonance and relationships that go deep. \\n\\nThis does tend to amplify some voices at the detriment of others. And I think you are correct in making the connection that better-connected voices tend to reach farther. (As happens in any group.)\\n\\nI'd wager that none of us can have deep connections with everyone else here - by now this is a huge party! So obviously selection happens. I think there are *at least* a hundred people here who are open to deeper connections and making a sincere effort to make them happen. This is a key part of the self-organization dynamic.\\n\\nI see three main ways to generate new connections with other edglings. The first and most important one is to pay careful attention to what is said and see where you find deep resonance with your own perception and thinking. Then engage in dialogue around these particular ideas. Pick your targets.\\n\\nThe second is to show what is unique about you, what differentiates you from everyone else. Everyone here wants to change the world. But what is your personal way? And importantly, what do you most need now to make progress? The more this is authentically and specifically defined and shared, the more pull you exert on others who are on nearby paths.\\n\\nThe third, and perhaps most powerful one, is free giving. Your post ended with an open-hearted offer that I wouldn't resist if I were traveling in your area. Thank you! When you offer engagement beyond words -- help -- to someone here who is trying to do something worthwhile, you open the door to collaboration and deeper relationships.\\n\\nNote that the above ideas actually carry over into the real world, but it seems that the odds of getting traction when you really try are unusually high around these parts, mainly because of the ambient level of awareness and attention.\\n\\nHope this helps! - Seb\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"633427121\",\"name\":\"Sabine\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":16,\"length\":6},{\"id\":\"511572735\",\"name\":\"Flemming Funch\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":318,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-12-30T21:30:33+0000\",\"like_count\":10,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"209731722447923\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\",\"id\":\"1204764827\"},\"message\":\"Oh Sabine, thank you for being so articulate, honest and for persevering with us <3 and thank you Seb for such a clear orientation.

Gore & Associates in 1958. At that time the whole organization of this company was futuristic and science fiction in the eyes of commoners. Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore who founded it together with his wife Vieve had been additionally proclaimed anti-manager. The organization resided on principles like complete decentralization, self-organizing teams, flat hierarchy and organizational chaos. The concept of the amoeba is a biocybernetic metaphor since its original ancient Greek meaning implies change or changeability. Especially a known subform of the  Amoeba Proteus the so called Amoeba Chaos Chaos underlines the connection between chaos theory and this kind of organization. The amoeba organization relies on two simple but strong principles: (1) the organization is a process,  not a structure, and (2) the organization is a complex (chaotic) system.\\\"\",\"message_tags\":{\"27\":[{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":27,\"length\":12}]},\"link\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"name\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"caption\":\"indecs.eu\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-24T14:07:46+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-28T19:42:59+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"579781763\",\"name\":\"Paul Mock\"},{\"id\":\"635786642\",\"name\":\"David Hood\"},{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\"},{\"id\":\"1422975257\",\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\"},{\"id\":\"225017\",\"name\":\"Thomas Maiorana\"},{\"id\":\"696561163\",\"name\":\"Kathia Laszlo\"},{\"id\":\"1045338394\",\"name\":\"Lucie Newcomb\"},{\"id\":\"19301400\",\"name\":\"Milicent Johnson\"},{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\"},{\"id\":\"664888262\",\"name\":\"Flora Moon\"},{\"id\":\"4200992\",\"name\":\"Jenny Ryan\"},{\"id\":\"317775\",\"name\":\"Bal\u00e1zs Lazlo Karafi\u00e1th\"},{\"id\":\"1314985753\",\"name\":\"Jennifer Sertl\"},{\"id\":\"704660253\",\"name\":\"Bruce Randolph Tizes\"},{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\"},{\"id\":\"702645559\",\"name\":\"Warren Te Brugge\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzAyNjQ1NTU5\",\"before\":\"NjgyMzE1OTQ3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"264094120345016\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\",\"id\":\"1482404646\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson Excellent, I like the idea to continue our thinking in new social organizations.

We are in transition, it's a process. The embryos of all different components already exist and their trajectory are converging towards a p2p society. The economic layer is the most important in my opinion. It will drive culture, governance and everything else.  \\nOur SENSORICA pilot project is all about p2p-rising the economy. \\nSENSORICA is a hybrid entity, composed of individuals AND small classic organizations (corporations that are recognized by the actual system), designed to evolve towards a truly p2p system, made of individuals only, by exerting pressures to dissolve the classic entities within it, into their individual components. It is hybrid for now, because we need to build bridges between the new economy that we are setting up, with the present-old economy, in order to allow transfer of resources. \\nMichel Bauwens is right, classic capital will not invest in p2p design and production directly. But we found a convoluted way to finance SENSORICA, i.e. to transfer resources from capitalism to the new economy, by playing on the fact that SENSORICA, as it stands now, a hybrid model, can be understood from 2 different perspectives: as an open and decentralized network of individuals and small (hierarchical) organizations (i.e. corporations) OR as small and independent corporations (again, recognized by the system) with access to a network of innovation. For funding we exploit the second perspective, but we operate according to the first one. \\nWe are expecting up to 80 000$ in government funding until the end of the year, we already got our first 10 000$, and our approach looks VERY promising. That is in Quebec Canada alone, and there is no conceptual barrier against a replication of the same elsewhere, where SENSORICA has members. \\nThere is an alternative free market taking shape, which will eventually replace Wall Street and other equivalent markets. The model is Kickstarter, not there yet, but on the road. We will engage in it very soon, which will provide SENSORICA additional funding. \\nAs we prove our model it will be replicated, and this will accelerate the creation of p2p markets, and will force crowdfunding to adapt to it, to become more efficient, and it will change people's opinion to trust the new model.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1102,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-04-11T16:32:07+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"275286662559095\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Tiberius Brastaviceanu\",\"id\":\"100000279944184\"},\"message\":\"SENSORICA is a pilot project for the new economy.

The grant requires the academic lab to be in partnership with a company, which provides something to the academic project. In our case Tactus provides a Mosquito prototype, time and expertise. We have over 80% chance to get the grant. The cash will NOT flow through the value network (SENSORICA), it has to be spent by the academic lab. BUT it is used to push forward a SENSORICA project. So there is value generated for the network. \\nNext week we have a meeting with another lab from Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal for another 25 000$ ENGAGE grant. In parallel, we are working with Montreal heart institute and Ecole polytechnique for a larger team grant, for 3 years, from which there will be some cash flowing through SENSORICA in addition of the value generated from advancing SENSORICA projects. \\nBeing open innovation, we discovered that it is VERY easy to interface with academia, because researchers have NO restrictions for publishing. \\nAnyway, this is another trick we pooled out of our bag and it seams to work VERY fine! If you think hard enough you'll find many ways to extract resources from the old economy...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-04-11T19:53:22+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"275432645877830\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Tiberius Brastaviceanu\",\"id\":\"100000279944184\"},\"message\":\"All right, I already gave you a few tricks... but now I have ask you for help :)  \\nWe are trying to figure out how to accelerate the development of our infrastructure, the value network infrastructure.

I want to bring David Hodgson into this since I know he and I will have a conversation about this at some point. I was thinking about this kind of personal profile over the last week independently and was worried about scalability. I guess there will be room for creative juxtaposition with personal narration being at the heart of it. I presume that artists can do best with such profile. My friend Jennifer Rittenhouse West for example who just joined Next Edge recently is a brilliant physicist and an artist too. I can visualize her profile including a magnificant self portrait she painted and shared with me in private a few days ago. What ever one juxtaposes, I find a self narrated clip such as that of Venessa a pre-requisite and a core.

The home of Disney World. And I'm going to walk the 35-odd miles from Disney to Sanford, Florida the former home of Trayvon Martin. And I'm going to talk to Trayvon's family if I can and learn their story. And I'm going to talk to the killer, if I can, and learn his story, the real story from his perspective. And I'm going to talk a bit with people about the real way that black and brown and red people are still being treated in the U.S.\\n\\nThen I'm going to gather up my stuff, and any friends with me. And we are going to set off for New Orleans. On foot. And we are going to walk the 1306 miles from Sanford to New Orleans, Lousiana, and Montgomery Alabama to Savannah, Georgia in time for the Tall Ships Festival on May 3rd.\\n\\nAfter the festival we are going to walk the 250-odd miles to Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta Georgia where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his sermons and help start the U.S. Civil Rights movement.\\n\\nThen we are going to walk up the Blue Ridge Parkway to Harper's Ferry, where John Brown tried to end slavery.

Not a way to solve anything. And I would make sure I'd have the means to back up what I say. I'd need to have the capacity to forcefully remind ANY offender of this point. Negotiations yes, war (and threat of war) no. \\n\\n- institute a drive for government transparency at all levels. If the administration is doing it, the people can know about it. That would be the general principle. People employ governments. They need to know, as any employer would, what is being done in their name. \\n\\n- remove all barriers to technological progress, especially but not only in the energy production\/distribution area. This would include ending the era of fossil-fuel burning, including the use of uranium or other nuclear fuels that present known hazards to health and our future. \\n\\n- institute a monetary system that does not create money as a debt and that allows for the smooth exchange of any goods\/services as well as for productive investment. This would include decapitating the currently existing speculative money and commodity markets. The economy is a game of production, not of Monopoly. \\n\\n- oh yes, end all government-granted monopolies and government-enforced prohibitions. There should be no monopoly on any goods (such as salt, tobacco and pharmaceuticals) or services (such as telecommunications, education or medicine) or information. This would not be done by anti-trust legislation but by liberalizing the laws that hold monopolies in place or that allow them to form. The first prohibitions to end would be drugs, pornography and prostitution. \\n\\nThese would be my first five.\\n\\nI would then make sure that countries, no matter how small, are treated with respect and are given all the help possible to develop their own capacity to feed their people, to manufacture their own necessities, and to grow the intellectual capacities of their population. \\n\\nI would also end environmental destruction by requiring frugal and responsible use of resources, and technological developments that allow us to grow and live within the means of our biosphere. \\n\\nI would promote respect for ALL other life forms.\\n\\nAnd talking about other life forms... I would promote the development of real spacefaring capacity: Propulsion that does not need to carry fuel (no more rockets...) Energy production in a similar way. Anything needed to get us to the stars, including the ending of government suppression of information on the existence of and past human interactions with races\/civilizations from other star systems and galaxies. \\n\\nDon't judge me too hard on that last point - I know it's too far out for many to even entertain the thought...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-11T10:14:28+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"348977991856628\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"id\":\"1063904902\"},\"message\":\"Mega-like the big perspective.

It would be an exercise in increasingly conscious, competent and wise self-organization.  Through each success we would be working our way out of our leadership jobs, with leadership functions devolving to people and the systems they design well to guide them.\\n\\nA BIG-PICTURE EVOLUTIONARY RATIONALE\\n\\nEvolution continually adjusts the Fit of all interdependent, interacting entities, changing and disposing of those entities as needed for the Fit (\\\"survival of the Fit\\\").  Collective wisdom allows us to be conscious participants in sustaining the ongoing Fit, continually learning how to sustain ourselves by creatively and persistently supporting the life of all upon whom (and which) we depend.  I see this as the essence of conscious evolution and, to an intriguing degree, of Evolution becoming conscious of Itself.\\n\\nINITIATIVES\\n\\nBringing greater wisdom to the functioning of politics, economics, and technological development - the three systems whose functioning have the greatest impact on our evolutionary trajectory - would be my highest priority.  Other systems - from health care to transportation, from education to energy - are dependent on those primary three for their rules and character.  Among the primary changes I would seek in each of those are:\\n\\nPOLITICS - transparency; random selection; mini-public deliberations; crowdsourcing journalism; systems thinking; limiting the impact of money\\n\\nECONOMICS - internalizing social and eco-costs in prices; shift from centralized debt money towards sharing and gifting, from consumerism towards deeply satisfying our deepest needs, and from waste and toxics towards cycling lightly through the biosphere\\n\\nTECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT - focus on technologies that support the vectors noted above; actively impede technological support for power-over (e.g., for violence, war, surveillance, political manipulation, etc., even \\\"conquering disease\\\"); learn from nature; use the precautionary principle.  \\n\\nWe are nature's creativity on speed and unless we rein in our technological and economic power we will soon create the capacity for small groups or crazy individuals to destroy civilization, humanity and\/or much of the rest of life on earth, on purpose or by accident.  We need collective wisdom to design, guide, and enforce this \\\"reining in\\\".  Focusing on improving individual and community capacity and health - despite the compelling immediacy of these approaches - is not only insufficient to generate collective wisdom but, under many circumstances, can actually guide us into collective folly.  We must - at the very least - be guided by the original definition of sustainability:  the ability of we in current generations to meet our needs without undermining the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Lots of empirical support of this. \\n\\nAlso, empirically, the #1 predictor of both fraud and extramarital affairs is opportunity - not the ethics, beliefs or commitments of the person. (Thus as a manager, if you wanted to treat employees well, you'd celebrate their willingness to do good, *and* make sure your accounting system made fraud very hard to hide.)\\n\\nSorry to be contrarian - and I'm not being contrarian in a deep way.

Are those people 'better people' because they fear the wrath of God? Or, is it better to do the right thing because you know it's the right thing and you are compelled to act in that manner? Which situation produces the most happiness and satisfaction and sense of fulfillment, rather than mere compliance?

Those systems would have to have some kind of initial settings or states, but they'd be unstable as the system learned this complex and shifting niche.

Your suggestion that psychopaths can't be rehabilitated implies that empathy is the only mechanism capable of motivating appropriate behavior.  That simply doesn't follow logically.

That sounds ridiculous to the average empath but for someone making a pure cost benefit analysis it could be quite convincing.  \\n\\nOf course that is an absurd example intended only to demonstrate the point - paying people not to commit crimes would introduce all kinds of moral hazard problems - but the point itself is not absurd.

These commons are facilitated and protected through non-profit civic associations, with the \u2018partner state\u2019 as their territorial equivalent, empowering and enabling that social production.

It also means that we do not have market restraints.  The market restricts production to that which can be sold at a profit.  In a CST we can produce for whatever demand there is within the organization.\\n\\nI disagree with the statement you quote regarding the nature of scarcity in the system.  It is the nature of markets that what is exchanged is that which is relatively scare to someone else in the market who has the money to pay for it.  When we only measure value in a market based medium of exchange, then we only value that which is relatively scarce.  The key then is to find a way to value that which humans need to thrive, which could be abundant, such as food, clothing, shelther,  education and health care, and find a different (non-market based) way to produce those things.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":6},{\"id\":\"1406709310\",\"name\":\"Monika\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":21,\"length\":6}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T16:52:37+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339518286135932\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"id\":\"528245547\"},\"message\":\"thanks David, will expore it more, though I'm  not sure what your last paragraph refers to, since I agree with it, and I think, this is exactly what I think as well, i.e. there can be an outgrowing of markets to the degree that we succeed in finding successfull non-market forms.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-13T14:44:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339543882800039\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Braden\",\"id\":\"578038073\"},\"message\":\"Sorry, I should be more specific.

Such grants could go to local groups at the forefront of applying breakthrough tools.\\n\\nThe challenge offers could also include benefits for students, jobseekers, and families in the exemplary communities. These would encourage them to become familiar with Next Edge opportunities (in telework, eLearning, and eHealthcare).  The challenge offer bundles could include small starter telework projects to begin building reputations in fast-growing freelance markets (Freelancer.com, vWorker.com etc). They could also include microstipends for access to online tutoring\/mentory and telemedicine resources.\\n\\nChallenge offers of this kind could help spread grassroots appreciation of opportunities in the DIY, peer-to-peer economy.  \\n\\nAn innovative aspect of these XPrize-style challenge offers could be their promise of an ongoing relationship.

Some further ideas on these lines are sketched at http:\/\/is.gd\/charity and http:\/\/is.gd\/princetonslides .\\n\\nLocal digitally-recorded stories could enrich subsequent versions of the videos and open source toolkits.

We want to allow for maximum emergence potential.\\n\\nIn proposing my original idea, I had three objectives in mind: bring people together into physical spaces to help build trust and to make it easier to get concrete work done; increase the sense of our being a global network with different cultures, problems and perspectives; create a framework for working together locally, regionally, and as a global group.\\n\\nIf we don't provide enough of a framework or a model for others to follow in at least a broad outline form, the idea won't gain traction as easily. \\n\\nThink of the TEDx events that have been spawned all over the world. The prior existence of TED set the standard and model for subsequent conferences and became the basis for an emergent movement. So the relatively tightly constrained TEDx framework actually increased emergence because no one had to invent the framework. The sandbox was defined within which individual groups creativity could emerge and flourish.\\n\\nToo much being open can make it harder for those who are not comfortable forging new ground on their own. An Edge Camp model can serve to help people contribute that might otherwise not feel they have the knowledge and expertise to pull something off by themselves.\\n\\nOne can start with what has been done before and experiment and learn by using the model and what has been done before as a starting point.\\n\\nBy having a target for camps that switch continents, we'll quickly see how our group is global and we'll also start to increase the global diversity within the group as the local events move the center of gravity of the group away from a Bay Area U.S. and East-coast U.S. centric one to a more diffuse moving center. By leaving it up to the local groups to define the agenda, we'll provide a framework for surfacing problems, issues, and cultural differences that might not show up otherwise.\\n\\nBy having a cyclical framework, we can start to work towards initiatives that span the globe and that interlink and interact with each other, strengthening our network between the people in the various clustered places we each live. The idea is that we'll not be all working on our own things, but we'll be working on pieces that tie into greater wholes. Edge camps will provide a regular framework for looking at how we can work together. The sun-based cycles tie into preexisting cultural values that permeate our history as humans.\\n\\nFor computer hackers, having timeframes and specific events where work can be demoed and where ideas can be improved onsite with other Edgers will make the process much more fun.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-12-15T17:24:47+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"200850856669343\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\",\"id\":\"520685736\"},\"message\":\"In thinking about the London Westminster Hub, and especially of the life's work of Vinay Gupta, Indy Johar, and John Robb.

I'm in the observation phase. Not sure what to make of it. I see the same discussions going on in several different places and the discussion seems to be the same..

So I am being conservative and say I will only weigh the gender lens 10 %.\\n\\nWe plan to set up a collective intelligence process using some software we are developing that will let people weigh in on where that 10% should be addressed across four different vectors. Getting better terms from vendors because they understand a more relational view of value exchange, higher margin from customers because they listen better to what their customers want and give them the things they value the most, in employees, retention, quality of workplace, etc. and in the network of partners and ecosystem members they associate with and build value with in a range of partnerships, from evolving past Barney deals; i like you like us, into we plan to do more together in the future, in jv's and other come to market strategies that are shared, and relationships that lead to mergers, acquisitions or sales or partial sales or royalty deals. \\n\\nUsing that criteria, how do you recognize the relational discount you get from funders, the relational premium you get from customers, the lower training and replacement costs you have among employees, and the overall growth and health of the relevant commons and non financial value your business is creating.

Gaia Herbs is here as well as www.bentcreekintitute.org, providing sourcing authentication and efficacy standards for Botanical medicine developers and processors. The abundance of natural healing and wellness in our area arises from our place as one of the worlds most biodiverse regions and our proximity to the Eastern Band of Cherokee, source of ancient botanical healing knowledge. WWW.plantsandhealers.org carries on the botanical studies teachings of Frank Cook, who had a home here until his unexpected passing a couple of years ago.

Central to this was his insistence on paying close attention to the successful evolutionary habits of the more-than-human world so that we humans can maximize synergistic\/symbiotic interactions with global ecosystems. His constant refrain of \\\"Utopia or Oblivion\\\" and things being \\\"touch-and-go\\\" illustrate that he was not a blind optimist.\\n\\nPersonally, I lose interest in any approach that insists that the cure to what ails us will some day be found within nanobots, GMOs, life extension drugs, space technologies, and other highly complex artifacts that are prone to instigate massive unintended consequences and\/or manipulation\/domination by a narrow sector of humanity.

And all along the way, we have far less control than we think. \\n\\nEither way (founder as God or parent), I wonder if (paradoxically) ownership gets in the way of stewardship.

Also, an organization usually consists of multiple people with immeasurable passions, ideas and contributions. It consists of patterns of relationship and context in community.  How can some few people own that? More to the point, how can they sell it?  Isn't it in some way like selling people as slaves?  \\n\\nAnd if so, how can we acknowledge and support the flow of value in ways other than legal ownership?  Besides decision-making power, people want to own companies so that they can (1) extract profit along the way and (2) sell their share  later for more money than they put in. So could we come up with a profit extraction formula that isn't based on ownership but on contribution?  Law firms and W.L. Gore decide pay by committee of peers.  It could be something like that.

One other broad strategy was proposed there - a metamarketplace, wherein understanding of each aspect of operations in every essential business\/industry is duplicated in a decentralized structure.  For example, if pandemic takes out half the workforce, the other half could reassemble the missing pieces of acumen.

Thus, I have no idea what WILL HAPPEN.  What has frustrated me for 4+ decades is that some viable (IMHO) paths we might take are missing from all discourse and invisible (in the sense that they are not seen when pointed to).\\n\\nAlthough all systems in Gaia interact in many ways, it can be useful to keep distinct the human systems and their influences and the \\\"natural\\\" systems. Also, to distinguish between different types of human systems and their relative impacts on Gaia.  My personal mission has been to catalyze a process that will insure the multi-millennial survival\/thrival of Humanity\/Gaia.  Although I would grieve the extinction of humankind, I would more grieve the loss of future humans and the emergence of their awesome potential.  I view humankind as embryonic and this era being our birthing phase.  I also grieve the losses to Gaia and fear the worse case scenarios.\\n\\nTime is short, and we risk it being much shorter than we expect.  In my analysis, our primary focus should be radically and significantly changing our human systems, since I believe the existing complex of human systems incapable of being significantly reformed; and until they are replaced all efforts to bring resilience and sustainability to Gaia will be blocked.  The sick powers-that-be, with their sociopathic leadership and technological resources are, in metaphor, an alien invasion (from within) of \\\"monster corporations\\\" on a suicidal track.  Human organizations are essential, and some today that may call themselves \\\"corporations\\\" are not what I am describing. Global corporatism and the separation of high finance from productive economics is as sick as the height of the inquisition - with their myth\/distortion of \\\"the market\\\" as a fanatical icon of true believers. The real damage to humankind and Gaia by this monster is below the radar of the vast majority, and even not perceived by most activists.\\n\\nAlthough the following simulation has yet to be performed, I believe that it can be demonstrated that large, ultra-complex, highly dysfunctional human societal systems cannot be significantly transFORMed.  Yet, we seem to be dogmatically stuck with transFORMation as the most general type of change.  Although the term \\\"emergence\\\" has increased in use over the decades, it is yet to be realized as an alternative to transFORMation.  With emergence a new FORM manifests which is not the transFORMation of any prior FORM.  Humankind's fixation on transFORMation may be due to the fact that transformation is the foundation of Science and Technology. We yet need to create a science of origination and emergence which is not a reduction back to transFORMation.\\n\\nAlthough insect metamorphosis is now a popular metaphor, it has yet to be realized as a systems analog for a Societal Metamorphosis that could REPLACE our sick \\\"Civilization\/societal-caterpillar\\\" with an emergent \\\"Humanity\/societal-butterfly\\\".  Civilization is the default mode of human organization (of large populations of diverse cultures) that is econo-centric.  In analog to the human body, econo-centrism demanding a narrow focus on food intake to the exclusion of all else leads to the deification of obesity and lack of concern where one shits, while sacrificing mobility.  Yet, almost all best efforts to fix our condition call for economic change, from within the oppressive structures of \\\"civilization\\\".\\n\\nProbably the defining characteristic of civilizations is the suppression of the potential phenotypes from the human genotype. The vast majority are blocked from developing their potentials ready in all healthy human births. Even the ruling elite and their bureaucracies are stunted in their development. As far as I know, no other species so limits the development of their children.  Of course, this loss is masked by the glitter of human progress - which is truly awesome, even when contrasted with what is missing.\\n\\nI envision a major process of uplifting the distribution of human cognitive\/emotive\/performance competencies in a decade of primary focus on a nu \\\"education\\\" defined as cycles of Organizing-for-Learning=&=Learning-for-Organizing.  Here we will have authentic \\\"trickle down\\\" from an enhanced humankind that will bootstrap the exponential growth of members for the emergent Societal Butterfly that treats all existing societal systems as a societal environment (with both dangers and assets).  In my view, this approach will 1) result in the most rapid improvement of the human condition and health in our biosphere, 2) result in the most rapid viable organization of people who might try to reform existing system (to enable the coming metamorphic replacement), and 3) result in a nu personal-to-planetary organization that will replace the collapsing systems of our last Civilization.\\n\\nAt this time I ask only for serious discourse on this alternative; if nothing other than it will shed new light on our present efforts.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-10-12T21:04:51+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"360404427380651\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Joris Claeys\",\"id\":\"1437664314\"},\"message\":\"Larry: I was following this thread from a distance, amazed at times but learnign as well, but Larry Victor - honestly and no offense but - I am really lost now.

And to do this, we have to re-integrate human systems with natural systems (so 're' should not necessarily be seen as something to avoid or move beyond)...

Thrivability requires a fundamentally different approach, one that is abundance-based, and not scarcity driven.

Some of us are experiencing or at least seeing it happening. As with every phase, while the previous one is still blooming or starting to go off to a flat curve, it is essential to know that humanity is so clever to come up with new things to motivate them to thrive - that is where the word is well used here above by some of you. Changing the word chaos to challenges is even better to highlight that humanity is never giving up as a whole at least... We always look for new ways to make progress and be happy. This group proofs that very well. So the activity here is thriving though challenges, therefore seeking and realizing resilience to ensure a sustainable environment. So to ,me all three are at its rightfull place. The next step is to bring them in relation to the how... much mve to be open to the potential that we are already entering the 4th paradigm in human history. We are forming it, it is hard to crick it up and hard to get ears outside a small group, but it is awakening and we and some other groups are developing it. It may take another 10 years before we see the start-up phase starting to curve up... We are inthe very beginning.\\nIt is good to learn from the past and I see many of you taking up examples and comparisons of what has been written or experienced and build upon those theories and practices.\\n\\nSome outside this group I think, have already start to name this 4th age, like: Age of reconciliation, dialogue, incisive knowledge ... some advocate a world in which resources are freebut unlimited thanks to technology and new explorations... All fine but it needs to happen as well. Many other people - thus humanity - is working on resolutions. The age we are entering - my view - is about dialogue and responsible social behavior.

(and that's where we can help in transitions).\\n\\nThe interesting thing about the commons is that it is whole and parts at the same time, so a commons as part, even if not recognizing the whole from the position it holds, is still only one step removed from the commons as a whole, and as a commons, it can work itself toward the commons as a whole\u2026\\n\\nSo now how do we create these immersive experiences, and how do we point all the vectors of change -the various pieces of the change aka variety of commons to grow \u2026- towards the commons as a whole\u2026 We need to get to the integrality of life to be 'described' 'bottom up' and not top down :)\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":8}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-11-10T22:40:29+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"371353909619036\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\",\"id\":\"100001413664942\"},\"message\":\"Absolutely love this, Helene.

It's been like a series of half-lives. There are endless breakthroughs in technology, organization, social dynamic theory, cognitive science, media and communication, information and computation, complex adaptive systems thinking, network science, and just about every conceivable field. Frankly, the most lame of the efforts has been capital formation (still stuck with one foot in mercantilism and the other in money markets).  Only one field has demonstrated even more advanced senescence, political thought (oops, I forgot religion). My strategy has shifted a little as a result: I am looking for \\\"smaller scale\\\" actionable projects, where we can learn from doing them. My premise is this: There are thousands of highly motivated, very smart people all over the world who \\\"sense\\\" that there are better ways to effect essential change. We recognize each other (like vampire characters in movies, with a knowing glance, a slow licking of the lips, a roll of the eyes.

I think crowdfunding and crowdsourcing are the most positive fruits of early 21st Century social action. We all seem to recognize the problem of reaching scale, but then isn't that actually the essence of the problem? So, learning how scaling happens across social domains is crucial, just like learning how disease spreads is central to managing health.

(I enjoy your reference to P.R.A. -for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the trauma I suffered the \u2018B\u2019 in my undergrad years for failure to discuss the significance of \u2018The Commons\u2019 with sufficient rigor in an American HIstory final.). My question is this: In the concept of \u2018the commons\u2019 there is also a distinction between rights of \u2018ownership\u2019 vs. rights of \u2018usership.\u2019 The Commons made it practical for small communities to manage a large enough piece of land where their individually owned livestock could graze. The Commons of the American colonial north became the site for other \u2018community-used\u2019 (rather than individually owned) assets, like the church, or town-meeting hall. (By contrast, in the southern colonies, the places for grazing livestock were part of the landowner\u2019s hold. The small farmer\u2019s had to find his own land to graze his livestock. (This distinction made \u2018owning\u2019 large plots of land crucial; so large numbers of laborers were needed to work the lands (slaves), while in the northern colonies, farms tended to be small, as the land needed for the care and feeding of livestock tended to be communal (New Englanders also owned slaves, but not as many per capita). So here we see how two contemporaneous strategies played out, \u2018The Commons\u2019 and \u2018The Plantation,\u2019 each with very different consequences in culture, perception,and historical trajectories. The discussion here is not only about the \u2018right way\u2019 or the \u2018wrong way\u2019 to develop social innovations. My sense of it is that \u2018actions\u2019 have consequences, and consequences produce information not previously recognized. We are in very real ways conducting social experiments. For instance why have political, legal, and economic systems organized as they are when so much about how humans interact in society has changed? We are not \u2018organized\u2019 as we were in the 17th and 18th centuries, but many of our \u2018institutions\u2019 remain bound by those constraints. Innovation, which gets a lot of good publicity these days is still manacled by accepted social norms, rituals, laws and truisms, that ought to be ignored in some instances.) Doing \u2018little\u2019 experiments doesn\u2019t seem to generate as much friction with existing norms, but can still produce important insights as to how things \u2018actually\u2019 work. Wouldn\u2019t Next Edge, LIving Bridges, or similar \u201cnetworked social labs\/incubators\u201d or whatever name they go by, be useful?

(BTW, I believe you will find that slavery in the north prior to 1800 was not uncommon in commerce, agriculture, or households in the north (and it moved west, too). After 1840 is was still legal in places in the north though most states had provided for emancipation in one way or another (e.g. indentured servitude was not uncommon at the household level in the northern states, until after the Emancipation Proclamation was made law, in 1863.)

That chain ownership--or hierarchy--in turn informed and justified the relational patterns we've come to know as the \\\"Great Man\\\" model of leadership.\\n\\nWith the the dawning of the knowledge era and, even more importantly, the emerging power and influence of network dynamics (aided, in no short measure, by mobile communication technology) the whole notion of a \\\"commodity\\\" has been radically rescripted. It's no long a field of corn, or a iron mine, or a shoe factory that can be used to generate capital. A set of relationships, or an ability to combine ideas, or a particular way of accessing information have suddenly become core commodities and these commodities don't follow the traditional lines of ownership as material commodities generally do. As a result the lines of authority and the relational patterns they suggest have likewise experienced radical shifts.\\n\\nThus we have an unprecedented shift in the nature of leadership that goes far beyond a softer and gentler approach.

Most organizations don't want to change but they are also desperate to be seen as changing, they don't want to be perceived as falling behind. Most consultancies are eager to gain revenues and thus don't really want to push organizations beyond their comfort zones. But they too also want to be seen as absolutely cutting edge. Somehow these two independent dynamics create the perfect dance team. The organization can justify it ethically in their mind because society does need much of what they do so it's OK if they produce it at 60% of what it could be. The consultancy can justify it ethically in their minds because they can help the organization move from 60 to 65%, and that is an improvement after all.

The whole line of we should partner with them because they have such vast resources and scale and *POTENTIAL* for good. All sound like the do gooder version of republican rhetoric of \\\"Job creators\\\" and \\\"trickle down\\\" \\n\\nI think a basic understanding on economics, systems and sustainability shows that the core model, the DNA, of transnational corporations makes it impossible for them not to be extractive and exploitative. To always sacrifice value creation over profit maximization. Wealth creation for the execs and largest institutional shareholders over legit economic development.   \\n\\nAs Paul Haken says \\\"To maintain the American way of life [and\/or the transnational model] we would need 3 more planet earths. \\n\\nAlso the false duality that only the venture capital, Investment banking or private equity and the transnational model can bring about the changes we are looking for since they are the only one with enough power and scale to do this. \\n\\nWhen a large amount of the reasons why social entrepreneurship needs to exist is the systemic problems that such dense concentration of wealth and power have created and the ecological, cultural and economic disasters it has created.  And the white gloves, cuddling culture of such systems which grants them above the law and immunity from consequences for their actions.  \\n\\nWhy we can not properly prosecute the people who violate the laws and regulations at such a massive scale (Wall st & Mega banks) because they fund both the politicians who write the legislations and decide who gets prosecuted and the do gooder community who comes to their aid citing CSR and all the good that could be done with their vast resources and scale. and they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. \\n\\nThere is another way to achieve legitimate change on a global scale in a far more powerful, lasting and fundamental way these top down models could ever even dream of. \\n\\nDecentralized scale via replication and collaborative networks who work to build strong, autonomous and interdependent local economies. The vast network of small businesses and free lancers is the backbone of the American economy (which is actually what gave rise and continues to fuel the growth and power of these transnationals) is far better suited to achieve the goals and potential of social entrepreneurship and impact investment (please name me 5 VC model impact investments who have had 10x-20x exits) via models like @Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE), Shift Change: Putting Democracy to Work, Evergreen Cooperatives, We the Owners... and many other community economic development and local wealth creation models for strong, sustainable economies that benefit and include, as members of equal importance and co creators of value and wealth, all the inhabitants of a town\/city who wish to participate. \\n\\nI'm very interested in hearing other sides to this and further expounding of what I've laid out.

The point you make about crisis and how in these times the seemingly useful and rational distinctions of age, gender, sexual orientation, politics, religion etc seem to disappear into the background is pretty much what happens in any sort of sartori or awakening experience.

Sure, there are similar issues around the world, yet the US is the poster child for unfettered corporate activities, corporate influence in politics and untrammelled growth. It's a point of reference, nothing more, but an essential one for engaging a global audience.\\n\\nI believe the trick here is to transcend and include.

i personally would love to bring africa and appalachia together to learn from one another, how they overcome poverty and resource extraction to be resilient in these nature-based sectors. but in respect for local ways and means and ecosystems, we will have to see if that fits, and starting first with what i know. which is that from many years working in this region, i know how quickly one can be shut down and shut out if one is ignorant of the community and what is already working or not working: what kinds of problems are they trying to solve and what do i have that could help that's different from what they already have?

The big problem arises when this individual wisdom (signal) is not transferred to the global population and the process begins again with a new target.  \\n\\nOf course, mileage may vary, but the point is that the ability to use present knowledge to retroactively evaluate past experience *and* to communicate that evaluation out to the collective intelligence substantially changes the fitness landscape for sociopaths.  \\n\\nOne might go farther - periodic FMRI for everyone in the network for example.

He was essentially nothing like the political libertarians you might argue with - personality-wise he was more like a Muppet. But he'd spent over a half-century thinking through how human affairs could be structured entirely by voluntary association and negotiation.\\n\\nEven he felt that there had to be some kind of external enforcement mechanism for covenants. Basically, when you make a spot contract, when you agree to something with someone and fulfill the agreement on the spot with no significant delay in time between promise and fulfillment, formality isn't needed. But once you introduce a significant gap between the start and end of the transaction, moral hazard opens up.\\n\\nConsistent with this, if technologies and norms for co-ordination make it possible to take activities that used to be beset with delays, and to synchronize them so that explicit pre-co-ordination can be replaced by simultaneous spot co-ordination, then you can expect the need for explicit covenants in those areas to decrease.\\n\\nMobile phones have us all pre-co-ordinating our activities less. We can organize on the fly. This general pattern can expand to include more and more economically productive activity over time, but you can't actually take time out of reality. Turning minerals and crude oil into cell phones will always require co-ordination across time.\\n\\nStill, the impulse to do away with explicit agreements and to design for spontaneity is productive. Existing as we do in the time period where Moore's Law remains in effect, the potential for shifting many activities to flash-work or swarm-work is huge.

The sociopath\/provocateur can thus hide behind people's natural desire to not rain on the party. Unless negative\/constructive feedback is made a requirement, part of the daily routine, people will tend to avoid generating conflict and, possibility, being perceived as the provocateur themselves.\\n\\nFor example, in the project I was involved in, we used hand signals to facilitate discussions. Everybody was comfortable waving their hands (to indicate agreement without having to take a turn speaking), but the \\\"thumbs down\\\" was almost never used. (Side note: the \\\"occupy\\\" version of the \\\"I don't agree\\\", that I'll call the \\\"raining fingers\\\", is less culturally charged and might have resulted in wider use.)\\n\\nWe need both Yin and Yang. While I would agree that positive reinforcement is more motivating, and should probably be favored, constructive\/negative feedback is essentially as important in order to make informed decisions. Of course, going to far with this results in traditional corporate practices, where negative feedback and reprimands are the norm. As usual, the key is in finding a good balance. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that by making this constructive feedback systematic and structural, people are freed from some forms of counterproductive self-censorship. If\/when mechanisms require constructive feedback, the potential for catastrophic reactions is reduced. Otherwise, conflict only becomes apparent once they are at a boiling point and, often, have become intractable.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T15:30:37+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216115765142852\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kurt Laitner\",\"id\":\"554482123\"},\"message\":\"@curtis just as bankruptcy law has served capitalism well so shall forgetful systems serve the network economy\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T15:33:35+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216153311805764\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"message\":\"Curtis Faith - Alpha isn't on facebook, though i had coffee with him last week :)\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Curtis Faith\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-10T16:34:32+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"216157278472034\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bret Weinstein\",\"id\":\"82300937\"},\"message\":\"Yes.

So implicit rules could have been, hey I promise never to kick you in the *ss for no reason, or spit on you, etc., the list goes on. Explicitly, though, we made commitments. Ex.

So I will. For those that don't know Shareable has always been here for those of us working to build a sustainable - shareable future. As a solo-preneur in this space nearly four years ago I truly.....truly felt crazy and alone - very alone. I started hyperlocavore.com while caring for my father who was dying of pancreatic cancer. I started it mainly as a way to stay sane in the middle of such grief and pain...to ground myself as my father died slowly in front of me going from a lion of a man to an angry agonozed husk of his old self and the economy collapsed, and we lost so so much. My family was not supportive as they were in crisis.. and thought it a waste of time. My dad on the other hand, kind of got it....and then Shareable wrote about it...and I started getting some press. That led to a bit in Martha Stewart's Living...which to my Dad's side of the family is *complete* confirmation of legitimacy. So Neal, and everyone at Shareable...your continued success is very very personal to me. I was in the desert and you were a clear pond of fresh cool water.           Why do I say all this? Well because I pass a lot of things on, efforts which are all worthy in my mind of money, support, kindness, encouragement, press - all things that Neal and Shareable gave to me at a most crucial moment in my life. Neal is probably the pivotal soul for my entrance to this very special community and in my restored confidence as a human being who wants to make a big change..(along with David Hodgson who invited me here.) I want to return the favor and the love and hope that you all will consider helping them reach their very modest goal of 10K by December 31st. It's such a tiny amount in the scheme of things!

I can recall at least a few instances where I have good reason to believe think tanks and others have borrowed my work without any attribution. All of my own work is based on synthesizing things I've learned from others over time (although I always try to give attribution). Increasingly, I have been trying to invert my thinking related to this.  I am trying to focus on ideas and concepts that I *want* people to \\\"steal\\\" with or without attribution: such as the concept of designing for interoperability, focusing on what can be shared among participants, and developing innovations within communities that can benefit from them (as opposed to in isolation). My earlier experiences where I felt that someone \\\"stole\\\" my idea without attribution caused me to think about how I might start to change the way I am communicating concepts and ideas. I realized it is on me to make sure that I am at least getting the leverage out of my work that I want to get. As long as I can accomplish doing something with it, that makes it less of an issue for me if others are maybe taking what I am doing and owning it somehow. I think that these days my core values and propositions to the world are actually more valuable to both myself and others if more people are adopting them and evolving them. I mean, for example I was one of the founding members of the BarCampBank movement, and wrote about \\\"p2p ventures\\\", and \\\"open business models\\\" way back in 2004-5, and even created one with the author of http:\/\/xtin.net and presented about this at an academic conference in Nottingham-Trent University in 2007 and now we see lots of people talking about \\\"open companies\\\" and \\\"open ventures\\\" like it's a brand new idea ;-) This used to really bother me. But now I am over worrying about this kind of thing. I just want to see people succeed at *doing* \\\"open business\\\" or whatever they want to call it whether or not I get any credit for my ideas in this area.

In Bali, for example, I'm told (by Joyce Lavalle) that the locals all perform a brief ritual of gratitude every morning before breakfast. And I have friends who go around the table at dinner taking turns to say one thing or person they are grateful for that day. At the Bainbridge Graduate Institute, one of the fundamental social practices they teach their sustainable MBA students is how to make public expressions of appreciation and gratitude for the work of others. http:\/\/www.bgi.edu\/student-experience\/five-practices-to-save-the-world-a-look-at-the-culture-of-a-sustainable-mba\/\\n\\nRe ownership of ideas: As a jazz musician, borrowing or \\\"quoting\\\" ideas from others when you improvise is standard practice. It's the original form of sampling, long predating digital mashups. And it's tragic that the clash between this rich creative practice and our out-of-control copyright system forced early music samplers like the Digable Planets and the Beastie Boys to NOT acknowledge the hundreds of giants on whose shoulders they stood.\\n\\nIn my previous career as a journalist, other people's ideas were my stock-in-trade. I've never really accepted the concept of ownership of ideas. As someone said early on in this thread, ideas don't have any inherent value. It's the act of sharing ideas that gives them currency. Currency is about flow, moving energy from one place to another. So, if ideas stop flowing, do they lose their value?\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"736739458\",\"name\":\"Jean\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":18,\"length\":4}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-10T00:30:58+0000\",\"like_count\":4,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"180965228657906\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jessica Margolin\",\"id\":\"624377462\"},\"message\":\"i can only speak for myself, but when i feel possessive, i'm ALWAYS afraid. usually, i'm afraid about survival-level issues. i think the crux is how to share\/credit\/be generous when terrified. i think that addressing the terror first (via network, cultural norms for identifying and addressing fear, etc.) will lead towards integrity.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-10T01:49:52+0000\",\"like_count\":6,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"180966105324485\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Heather Vescent\",\"id\":\"503265579\"},\"message\":\"I wrote a couple posts about this exact thing a few years ago.

Social Media works because it gives people a sense of identity and belonging. But what about revenues and the way content is shared? People need to be empowered to be the individuals that they are! It's through fear of loss - financial and social - that society holds back. If we create systems that authentically share in reflection to what others give it, the people will come.

Software for building a distributed network, CM is simply a backbone for creating a network on which all else can grow and be shared. To be led by Michel Bauwens of P2P Foundation, the idea is to create a co-op that matches development needs with solution providers and crowd-sourcing\/investor system so the 'guys who get the job' can get paid (voluntary developments welcome too ;). \\n\\nBy 'development needs' I don't just mean modules\/apps\/software integrations, but non-digital needs as well. E.g. Facilitating Community Workshops for teaching Citizen Journalism or Permaculture in Zambia (Yes.. I'd be referring to Steven's amazing 'Water's Edge' project here.. which is nothing short of amazing by the way...).\\n\\nAlthough we still have some development work before we can release the code, CM is\/will be open source. One of the conditions to using the code, however, will be that any developments made will also be open source. Another requirement will be that the code is being used to help create a sustainable world. When someone wants to use CM code to create a network, they'll be asked (in some way or another) to share how their network contributes and why. \\n\\nHere's to BRIDGING VOICES ON THE EDGE OF FREEDOM!

You mentioned what I think is a key term here: Coordination. Other key terms: Planning. Execution. Efficiency.\\n\\nThe goal was to operate The Next Edge as a distributed process, the result was chaos and diminishing participation. Yet this problem was identified and communicated to the group and no one responded (except for 6 Likes).

I get it.\\n\\nWhat did Empires do when they were fighting wars, long before the appearance of the first computer? Well, they had communication networks, they had systems.. Optical telegraphy was used in ancient times, and what kind of signals do you think were most important to the people using them? They certainly weren't using the distributed optical telegraph system to warn people that Queen Kardashian farted.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not a process expert, but I work with signals. To work with a signal, I need to know what kind of signal it is. I'm not asking if it's a wireless signal or what its frequency is, what medium is being used. I do ask those questions, but most importantly, for the work I do, in any case, is identify what kind of signal it is. In my taxonomy of signals, the category of signal Mark gave is at the top of my list of signals I watch out for. It was indicative of something important, and was not heeded. That spells danger in any system that I know of.\\n\\nIf I have a fever of 103 and do nothing, I risk dying. In audio engineering, I watch to make sure the signal doesn't go \\\"in the Red\\\". That's the metaphor I wish to leave you with: \\\"in the Red\\\". Red lights mean Stop at an intersection. The Next Edge, in the case of Mark's post, drove through the Red light.

I propose we need TWO process\/models: 1) starting from the Here&Now (as accurate as possible) and 2) beyond the end game (our visions of a target state\/dynamics after we encounter the corporatist NWO). We need alternatives and rules for scientific competition of alternatives in both domains.  Then we need to work on what joins the models. For example, I believe a primary effort now should be for competency uplift (nu education) out of which new \\\"economic\\\" forms will emerge.  We do need companies for interacting with the existing economic system, but will \\\"companies\\\" be functional components in the new system to replace this existing system?\\n\\nAll this will take time and effort, and thus this complex of projects must be an intermediate objective.  Exploring models (2) will reveal hidden assumptions that limit our alternatives for models (1).  I imagine two domains for (2): transformation or metamorphosis (as more than metaphor). I forecast that the transformation models will prove impossible, but modeling is needed to demonstrate this. This is important as all (1) efforts appear to me in the context of transformation; and potentially a dead end.\\n\\nAs for models (1). Will they need to differ for whether Obama or Romney are presidents the next four years?  What are our alternative societal\/technological environments for the next few years? Second order planning calls for keeping as many options open as possible and not to fixate on one programmatic path. Emergents (by necessity to function as emergents) must mask most ugly contemporary news; which may result in questionable assumptions that their working societal environment for the next few years will be basically unchanged.  Although no one can accurately forecast our turbulent future we need to prepare for alternatives.\\n\\nAll this implies that our efforts must expand orders-of-magnitude. If we are honest about the real challenges we face, and consider the Law of Requisite Variety (Ashbey's Second Law of Cybernetics). our action\/plans must be commensurate with the magnitude\/complexity of our challenge.  In my estimation we need to quickly mobilize and \\\"educate\\\" at least 1\/4 of the global population to meet this challenge.  Our contemporary progress in this direction is not sufficient and there are no existing visions to even attempt such an endevour (other than my own proposals for UPLIFT).\\n\\nA PERSONAL NOTE.

And ultimately we need to learn to trust ourselves, to build trusting relationships with each other, and to create institutions that support us in those relationships.\\\"\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-01T04:19:19+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"345481975539563\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"id\":\"739008859\"},\"message\":\"It's worth following the Ellen McArthur Foundation, they are also supporting work on alternative currencies.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-01T06:57:20+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"345509172203510\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Chris Cook\",\"id\":\"671176264\"},\"message\":\"Michelle Holliday \\n\\nThe fact that Riversimple is an LLP was at my suggestion a good few years ago in meetings involving Patrick Andrews and Hugo Spowers, who was founding Riversimple at the time.\\n\\nOne of the key points of the structure was that Hugo wanted to facilitate a leasing\/use model, rather than to sell the vehicles, which in his (completely correct) view does not incentivise either quality or energy efficiency. \\n\\nThe other was to hold the intellectual property in trust, and to allow anyone to use it on an 'open source' (OS) basis.

I don't mean moving in together, necessarily, but certainly to work on what we actually can do for each other. As opposed to talking about what we're going to do out in the world. I'm not saying we're not working together, we certainly are. But we're not very much working together in the sense of actually depending on each other.\\n\\nIf this were an Occupy camp, some of us would be manning the kitchen. There would be a medical tent, staffed by some of us who have the required skills. There would be a conflict resolution section over there. There'd be workgroups for infrastructure, communication, etc. Every day a bunch of us would annonce trainings in a variety of survival skills we need. If we needed something, there'd be a good chance that it already had been organized.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not saying we're not doing anything, and that we don't have workgroups. But it is a good deal more theoretical than it would be if it somehow really counted. No insult meant to anybody. I just can't help but wonder whether it would be more useful if we got really concrete about what each of us can do for each other, or what we in small groups can do for the whole here. I.e. a more internal focus than what we seem to have at the moment. Like, if I personally had to look at what I could be available for in this group, which would be useful and valuable, it would probably have to be something a good deal more tangible than to provide good ideas and add comments and likes to other people's posts.

I'd relate the pretty negative to a few things:\\n1. The research that was cited around the acquisition of Instagram was all about how users spend more time looking at photos than anything else. So great, this whole images plus words thing is just a by product of our preference for shiny pretty things over engaging with more complex ideas than are typically found on these things. \\n\\n2. This meme has now almost completely dissolved into the eternal enemy of creative thought in any medium - the chain letter, in cutesy photo, banal text and unimpeachable liberal injunction. I'm sure the same exists on the other side. David and Saul you know what I'm talkin about. Kevin Edds is, in my humble opinion guilty of this. \\n\\n3. The user experience of Facebook has gone to pot. The iPhone version takes 60 seconds to load a page - probably because of all the images which, when they do load, are too small to read on an iPhone without zooming into individual sections of the photo. Trying to fight through the fire hydrant of stuff that flows through NE on mobile? Forget about it. \\nAs a result, Facebook has never felt more like a waste of time. It's never felt more browser based than it does now - that's the only environment it functions as it should...or where they make any money (no ads on mobile). \\n\\nSo what exactly do we have to celebrate, except maybe Saul's idea that it proves that people are fundamentally good eggs (which I happens to believe, independently and perhaps in spite of this meme). I'm being a bit over the top here for effect but is my Ux of this phenomenon really so different?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-07T06:57:39+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"327502514004176\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lori Kane\",\"id\":\"1131972354\"},\"message\":\"Yep, cool huh? :-)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-07T07:05:21+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"327502954004132\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Gunter Wehmeyer\",\"id\":\"541176492\"},\"message\":\"agreed...mental openness is important to me, but that doesnt mean necesarily being open everything and everyone on fb too\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-07T07:08:30+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"327530574001370\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"id\":\"1120956519\"},\"message\":\"Christer Hellberg - we were kind of playing with that concept on Pinterest - seems to have died down but we for a while were playing with emphasizing our visual sensory apparatus...lots of us are there!\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"824960674\",\"name\":\"Christer Hellberg\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":17}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-07-07T09:46:57+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"327535000667594\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Christer Hellberg\",\"id\":\"824960674\"},\"message\":\"Havn't really investigated that yet..

We discussed and applied this model to place-based partnerships and networks for health promotion and population health. Essentially, what was posited was the need to establish and\/or bootstrap the pre-requisite baseline requirements to enable the maturity and evolution of individuals and systems. The model as proposed talked about non-linear quantum developmental leaps (integration and evolution) using orienting metaphors (or intentional action states) from Competition to Communication to Cooperation to Coordination to Collaboration to Co-production to Co-creation to Community.  We noted that collaboration and democratisation wasn't always a neutral politics-free process. In addition to the Enabling Spiral (above) we also posited a Disabling Spiral from Competition to Compromise to Co-optation to Collusion to Cartels to Coup de Tat to Compost. This was a spiral, holarchical model.

This is the transformation that we need to make now as a civilization. The shift is from the industrial mindset to the living mindset. An organization is structurally dead, an organism is alive. Being part of something that is dead is a very different experience from being part of something that is alive. Being part of an organization means that you become a character in a play that somebody else wrote, being part of an organism means that you are instead engaged in an improvisational happening. In an organization you know your role, it feels safe, you relate to other people through this definition; in an organism, things can feel uncertain, because we are so used to being defined by a role (but I am not a number, i am a free human being..)\\n\\nOrganizations have value, but it is transient based upon the thing being produced.

They tend to be more effective where the problem requires a (relatively) large step function investment of resources before getting reward.  \\n\\nTo use a practical example, Apple iphone is a case study on where hierarchy can beat meshworks (and their use of the app store is a case study of where they must defer to meshworks).\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1063904902\",\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":16}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-10-29T16:13:46+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"176010919153337\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"id\":\"739008859\"},\"message\":\"This reminds me of a paper of Russell Ackoff on the mismatches between systems and their models that may offer a good basis for refining the characteristics of the various forms of \\\"orgs\\\" and innovation network: www.acasa.upenn.edu\/System_MismatchesA.pdf\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-10-29T17:29:18+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"176043685816727\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Richard Spencer\",\"id\":\"100000656768442\"},\"message\":\"David great thought.

One is Thomas Petersen's \\\"ghost protocol\\\" - http:\/\/000fff.org\/the-ghost-protocol-digital-identity-for-immortals, which points to the (potentially timeless) power of implicit forms to organize solid matter, and to make them virtually immortal. \\n\\nIf a well-loved, immersive narrative \u2013 say Lord of the Rings \u2013 were inspire individuals to organize in corporate (legal) form, one might speculate that this vessel would tend to animate adherents for generations beyond the life of its founders. If so, this would correspond to the way in which individual cells in our bodies die, yet are followed by successors that continue the personal storyline of our being.\\n\\nTo take it a step further, we might add into the mix the insights of Matt Jones in 'The New Negroponte Switch,' on the physicalization of intangible data: http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/schulzeandwebb\/the-new-negroponte-switch .  Jones opens the door wide open to the possibility that the virtual \\\"ghosts\\\" existing after our physical demise (as Petersen describes) may have nfluence the shapes and actions of solid, physical matter.\\n\\nI'm all for rescinding the special politically-granted privileges of corporations.  Yet voluntary agreements, as Yasuhiko Genku Kimura has described in earlier Next Edge posts, may give rise to (legitimate) contractual corporations that continue to exist for many generations.   Perhaps a collective consciousness may manifest across generations in such corporations, much as one emerged from the assembled short-lived cells comprising our bodies?   \\n\\nIf so, will corporate forms animated by an emergent collective consciousness themselves deserve legal standing alongside other sentient life forms?  cc Arthur Brock Helene Finidori Jean Russell Michel Bauwens Jordan Greenhall\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"100000656768442\",\"name\":\"Richard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":7},{\"id\":\"522885779\",\"name\":\"Yasuhiko Genku Kimura\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1327,\"length\":21},{\"id\":\"725829941\",\"name\":\"Arthur Brock\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1818,\"length\":12},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1831,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"736739458\",\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1847,\"length\":12},{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1860,\"length\":14},{\"id\":\"665043478\",\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1875,\"length\":16}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-10-29T22:55:43+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTc2MTI2NTc5MTQxNzcx\",\"before\":\"MTcyMzg5NTEyODQ4ODEx\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_227122344042194\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Venessa Miemis\",\"id\":\"630505808\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"i just got back from a trip to vermont to visit with Amy Kirschner about building resilient cities. she and Kyra Kristof Pincheira made this very cool \\\"Decision Tree for Vision Manifestion\\\" to map out an inquiry process to help people go from ideas to action. i've been working on transferring that to an infographic.

They defamed the speakers, in trying to justify the decisions, which they claimed were made by their anonymous scientific panel. They made claims about what the speeches purportedly said that were simply not true, and in fact they have apologized for the original reasons posted on their blogs for removing the videos (probably because their lawyers told them to do so to avoid litigation). In the process of rewriting their blog posts and publishing supplemental blog posts to explain their reason for (re)moving the videos, they actually dug themselves into an even deeper hole, as these revised arguments are even feebler and more offensive than the original ones. The argument that Hancock's video had to be (re)moved because it might be seen in schools as TED's approval for young people to be using ayahuasca (and hence exposed TED to legal risks) is absolutely preposterous.\\n\\nAs for the issue of removal vs moving, they were moved from the immensely popular TED YouTube channel, where most people go to find TED(x) talks, including full transcripts, to the TED blog, in the middle of the aforementioned weak and insulting critiques of them.

The NY Review of Books founding editor, Robert Silver, had a telling comment on this in the wonderful interview with him that appeared in New York magazine:\\n\\n\\\"If a novel is published, we have a novel review. If poetry is produced, if a play or a movie or a TV show is produced, there are the forms of criticism we know. With the new social media, with much of the content of the Internet, there are very few if any critical forms that are appropriate. They are thought to be somewhere partially in a private world. Facebook is a medium in which privacy is, or at least is thought to be, in some way crucial. The premise, at least, is that of belonging to a family, a circle of friends. And there\u2019s another premise, that any voice should have its moment. And so there seems a resistance to intrusive criticism.\\n\\nBut this means that billions of words go without the faintest sign of assessment. And yet, if one cares about language, if one cares about the sensibility in which language is expressed, and if one cares about the values that underlie our use of language, such as affection, privacy, honesty, cogency, clarity\u2014then these media, it would seem to me, should qualify as the subject of criticism. We seem at the edge of a vast, expanding ocean of words, an ocean growing without any critical perspective whatever being brought to bear on it. To me, as an editor, that seems an enormous absence.\\\"\\n\\nhttp:\/\/nymag.com\/news\/features\/robert-silvers-2013-4\/#print\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"516134310\",\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2013-04-16T07:19:59+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"440899259331167\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Hall\",\"id\":\"100004356039609\"},\"message\":\"Way to rock the comments, Dave!

TED thinking's got a hard determinism to it; a kind of technological hyperrationalism. It ignores institutions and society almost completely. We've come to look at these quick, easy \\\"solutions\\\" as the very point of \\\"ideas worth spreading.\\\"\\n\\nBut this seems to me to miss the point and power of ideas entirely. Einstein's great equation is not a \\\"solution\\\"; it is a theory \u2014 whose explanations unravel only greater mysteries and questions. It offers no immediate easy, quick \\\"application\\\" in the \\\"real world,\\\" but challenges us to reimagine what the \\\"real world\\\" is; it is a Great Idea because it offers us something bigger, more lasting, and more vital than a painless, disposable 'solution.' \\\"\\n\\n - Too True. This type of thinking is definitely pre-TED, probably the inspiration for TED's mission. It ignores the part of the process of innovation that is unknown (i.e. mysterious); sometimes you're just trying weird crap, without having any notions of usefulness or utility. Not every idea that \\\"solves\\\" a problem was conceived to \\\"solve\\\" a problem, maybe not even the most important ones (via Sheldrake, Hancock, McKenna, Whitehead, McLuhan, etc.). TED and institutions like TED encourage us to ignore the strange, peculiar and unlikely in order to focus our attention on the useful; all the while the strange and unlikely is where the \\\"solutions\\\" actually hang out, as history has shown time and time again.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2013-04-19T21:36:14+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"442773509143742\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"id\":\"1120956519\"},\"message\":\"...can you give a few examples John? of these solutions...?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2013-04-19T21:38:38+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"442798885807871\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Hall\",\"id\":\"100004356039609\"},\"message\":\"Here's one from the way back, when science was no more than the frivolous hobby of gentlemen scholars which they called \\\"Natural Philosophy\\\" and a decade before Galileo was ordered to come to Rome to stand trial over his outrageous advocacy for a very unlikely theory called \\\"heliocentrism\\\",  there was a young soldier sleeping in a shack in Bavaria, troubled by strange dreams...\\n \\n\\n'On the night of November 20, 1619,  [a soldier of the Duke of Bavaria], who was also an aspiring philosopher still in his early twenties, had a series of three dreams which changed the course of his life and of modern thought. He reports that in his sleep, the Angel of Truth appeared to him and, in a blinding revelation like a flash of lightning, revealed a secret which would \u201clay the foundations of a new method of understanding and a new and marvelous science.\u201d In the light of what the angel had told him, [the soldier, Rene] Descartes fervently set to work on an ambitious treatise called \u201cRules for the Direction of the Mind.\u201d The objective of his \u201cnew and marvelous science\u201d was nothing less than to describe how the mind works. For Descartes, who was to invent analytical geometry, there was no question but that the model for this task was to be found in mathematics. There would be axioms (\u201cclear and distinct ideas\u201d that none could doubt) and, connecting the axioms in logical progressions, a finite number of simple, utterly sensible rules that were equally self-evident. The result would be an expanding body of knowledge.\\n\\nDescartes never finished his treatise; the project was abandoned after the eighteenth rule\u2014perhaps because it proved more difficult than he had anticipated. He did, however, eventually do justice to the angel\u2019s inspiration in the famous Discourse on Method, which is often taken to be the founding document of modern philosophy. Descartes\u2019 project was the first of many similar attempts in the modern world to codify the laws of thought; almost all of them follow his lead in using mathematics as their model. In our day, the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science can be seen as part of this tradition, but now united with technology and centering upon a physical mechanism\u2014the computer\u2014which supposedly embodies these laws.\\n\\nThe epistemological systems that have been developed since the time of Descartes have often been ingenious. They surely illuminate many aspects of the mind. But all of them are marked by the same curious fact. They leave out the Angel of Truth\u2014as indeed Descartes himself did. For he never returned to the source of his inspiration. His writings spare no time for the role of dreams, revelations, insights as the wellsprings of thought. Instead, he gave all his attention to formal, logical procedures that supposedly begin with zero, from a position of radical doubt...'\\n-Roszak, Theodore.

Culture is the lifestyle practiced (mostly not espoused, though) by the large majority. So obviously if the culture should change, individuals lifestyles need to change. \\n\\nThat means in my view, lifestyle (as the meaning has been generally determinded here) is the aggregated behavior of a person; NOT what  we say, but what we do day to day constitutes our lifestyle. Or put in a different way: If what we say and what we do is in dissonance than part of our lifestyle is being hypocrits...\\n\\nHaving said this, obviously, the 'golden rule' to designing a wholesome (not dissonant but harmonic) lifestyle is simply: Say what you really mean, and do as\/what you say. If that entails \\\"living your dream\\\" as Alex is doing and talked about above, or Jean following her strategy - which is a very challenging one especially living #4 - ... that's what it is. I don't really believe there's much choice about lifestyle, especially once you know that you can't really avoid your inner sense of rightness (which tells you always what is good, true and beautiful and what isn't)...\\n\\nAlso it seems to me that since the US is built on agentive individualism the \\\"lifestyle on the edge\\\" translates into individualistic strategies (also forming groups of course) to counter the apparent slide into one of the many horror-scenarios from the grand collection that has been written in that last 50 years or so - of which a couple have somehow put on the back-shelf, like the very plausible horror-scenario of \\\"nuclear winter\\\" of the 80ies.

Immaterial values such as \\nsocial justice or environmental protection are accorded \\nso much importance that they influence the attitude \\nGermans have towards the economic system; for exam\u00ad\\nple, 88 percent of respondents think that the current \\nsystem is not suitable for taking environmental pro\u00ad\\ntection, resource conservation, and social redistribu\u00ad\\ntion, adequately into account. The majority would like \\na \u2018new economic system\u2019, and does not really believe \\nin the resilience and crisis resistance of purely market\u00ad\\ndriven  economic systems. Particularly younger Ger\u00ad\\nmans do not trust the market\u2019s self\u00adrestorative powers, \\nand call for improved compatibility between economic \\ngrowth and environmental protection. The survey sub\u00ad\\nstantiates that in Germany, postmaterialist thinking is \\nby no means limited to the well\u00adoff and educated.

All cells get what they need to thrive, and those cells doing the most important jobs are \u201cpaid\u201d more. Some even are given a \u201cstaff\u201d of supporting cells.\\n    Excess \u201cwealth\u201d is stored in community \u201cbanks\u201d (i.e., fat cells) and gets allocated based on the needs of the whole system.\\n    There is no \u201cborrowing.\u201d The body gets to use only the energy available.\\n    There is no \u201cinflation.\u201d The value of ATP had remained stable for seven billion years!\\n    In regards to government, the cellular system embodies the official motto of the United States, e pluribus unum, out of many one. Each cell is \u201cfree\u201d to thrive, provided it contributes to the well being of the whole system.\\n    Divisive and dualistic politics is unknown in the body. Different polarities \u2013 like proteins and lipids \u2013 cooperate to create an integrated whole.\\n    Unlike the human mass media, our bodies rely on accurate information, unspun and undistorted, so that our protection systems can distinguish between real and imaginary threats. \u201cDialogue\u201d between individual cells and the body\u2019s central voice goes on all the time, and the \u201cgovernment\u201d listens and endeavors to do what is best for the whole system.\\n    In a cell \u2013 or for that matter a human body \u2013 growth and protection mechanisms are mutually exclusive. Growth is represented by moving toward a stimulus with \u201copen arms\u201d in order to assimilate and grow. In contrast, protection is moving away from a stimulus and closing down. While protection is sometimes necessary to defend one\u2019s life, protection behaviors use the system\u2019s energy but do not provide the system with energy for survival.\\n    Consequently, an organism that spends an inordinate amount of time in the protection posture is by definition undermining its health. There is a biological truth behind being \u201cscared to death.\u201d While protection is necessary, an \u201covermilitarized\u201d body is expressing a pathology called \u201cauto-immune dysfunction.\u201d\\n\\nSource: http:\/\/www.brucelipton.com\/spontaneous-evolution-questions-partial-answers\/\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13},{\"id\":\"665043478\",\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":175,\"length\":16}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T12:55:15+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262287937192301\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"id\":\"736739458\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson See this article on ecosystem approach to providing solutions rather than products: http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/cs\/2012\/03\/amazon_vs_apple_competing_ecos.html?awid=5848553668940239991-3271\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T14:29:51+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262292797191815\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"id\":\"736739458\"},\"message\":\"Daniel F.

The use of a biological structure or function for a purpose other than that for which it initially evolved. 2. An evolutionary process in which a given adaptation is first naturally selected for, and subsequently used by the organism for something other than its original, intended purpose. 3. Exaptations \u2013 Features (such as feathers) that evolved by selection for one purpose (such as warmth) and were later adapted to a new purpose (such as flight).

I figure purpose can be deducted from evolutionary history of features, but how do we distinguish purpose as intent from just using what is available?\\n\\nMark Roest's response:\\n\\nUsing what is available is the line of least resistance (the Way of the Tao) of manifestation of intent. It is not necessary to separate intent and purpose. When a being or a flock of beings has intent to live and tries various strategies in the face of a category of challenge, some as solely an internal selection process and some through experimentation (trial and error, play), any yielding to effort will be pursued. Learning continues, and if successful learners survive at a higher rate than non-learners, the characteristics that made them able to learn well, in the new direction, will expand in prevalence in the gene pool.\\n\\nWe know that life has the intention to live; play is largely about learning patterns of successful ways to surmount challenges, and play is ubiquitous in mammals. Non-mammalian life forms also show purpose and directed coordination in their behaviors. The entire process of evolution displays meta-intention, prima facie. That meta-intention may have aspects of pure system artifact, and of Universal Intelligence \u2013 and everything between.\\n\\nWe are writing about millions of parallel, interactive streams of evolution on a planet with hundreds of eco-regions and thousands of ecosystems, in a surface area of about 198 million square miles <http:\/\/wiki.answers.com\/Q\/What_is_the_area_in_square_miles_of_the_surface_of_the_earth_including_land_and_water>, over a 3 billion year time scale. There is clearly room for multiple meta-systems of adaptation, motivated and perhaps guided by infinitely varied forms of intention and consciousness, to occur in parallel and over time.\\n\\nIf we are open to the metaphysical, we can also see (or at least learn about and tune in to, for me so far) a whole systems perspective which is not in denial of the unseen. Said denial was necessary for the emergence and domination of European practical science and the Industrial Revolution, which provided the necessary logistical and military advantages to enable colonialism as a multinational policy of empire.

But, and I think it partly because I'm not very advanced in these deep subjects, what I've been primarily interested in this thread is just to get a handle on the metaphor of ecosystem. And for me what's stood out is the part of the metaphor which deals with the dual governing by internal factors. T\\n\\nThere are many ways to model networks mathematically. However I don't believe--and I am terribly ignorant--that the how-to of modeling the dual governing of internal factors within ecosystems is anywhere nearly as mature as network analysis.\\n\\nJim Rutt, if I understand him correctly, is quite confident in a materialist point of view, to the extent that even raising metaphysics seems counterproductive to the conversation. However he helpfully points to Terence Deacon. You might also get some idea of the approach to causality as constraint in the work of Alicia Juarrero. Evan Thompson perhaps provides some measure of caution about a Deacon's materialist perspective.\\n\\nGotthard Gurther's Cognition and Volition is interesting because it seems he hit upon some logic which might be useful for the dual aspect of internal factors in ecosystems which are hard to model. And it's this part that makes me, as ignorant as I am, reticent to equate ecosystems with networks as Troy Camplin does. \\n\\nMy hunch is aligned with yours David, that ecosystems and networks are different.

Thus with differing definitions and meanings for key terms: metaphysical, network and ecosystem. I contribute from my own biases.\\n\\nI see a confusion between concepts such as network, system, ecology to reference 1) conceptual frames we employ in our language discourse and 2) implication of objective existence for entities so named. This takes us to the distinction between process and existential ontolgies, a distinction that can be important in some discourses and not important in others.\\n\\nI have come to distinguish between four distinct conceptual frames: nets, systems, holarchies, ecologies.\\n \\n NETS are the most primitive of the structures - but can be very complex. They are characterized by nodes (which can have properties), links (which can have qualities), and temporal relations between nodes over links.\\n \\n SYSTEMS have a core net on which constraints on process give it agency\/identity and a character where \\\"the whole is more than the sum of the parts\\\".  General Systems Theorists tend to use the term \\\"system\\\" to apply to anything.  I prefer to limit the use of the term to one level - the system composed of components, relationships between components, subsystems (important to distinguish from components), and environments.  With this limited use, components and environments are viewed \\\"classically\\\" and not viewed themselves as systems (with the exception of considering the interaction between small sets of systems that share the same environment).\\n \\n HOLARCHIES (Koestler's terminology) are nested  holons, where each holon is a system in the sense above.  James Greer Miller in his opus, \\\"Living Systems\\\" identifies 19 common (structural) subsystems in holons from cell to global societies - with a similar holarchy from atom to cell not covered by Miller). Miller distinguished between \\\"nested hierarchies\\\" and \\\"echelon hierarchies\\\". I find the distinction between system and holarchy very important.\\n \\n ECOLOGY is still emerging in my conceptual scheme.  An ecology appears to be a mixture of nets, systems, and holarchies with the addition of a fractal-like character.  Also, in an ecology a node\/component in one holon my relate directly with a node\/component in another holon. Temporality is essential in comprehending ecologies.  There is an essential tension between a \\\"balance of nature\\\" and \\\"evolutionary\/emergent\\\" processes (occurring at all levels) challenging the balance. Mutual aide, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis must be considered in changes in ecologies.\\n \\nSimple ecologies can serve as conceptual frames for human dynamics.  There is an issue whether pure networks can have agency beyond the sum of agencies of the nodes.  I use the term \\\"sysnet\\\" for a large network where smaller systems emerge among subnets, where the systems can later dissolve and the nodes return to being but subnets.  Most digital entities are sysnets. We can mistake our intention of expectant agency of our networks, as we resist constraints (re threats to our \\\"individuality\\\") that would enable more systems with agency to emerge (and often enhance our own agency using the systems for leverage).\\n\\nThe issue re \\\"metaphysics\\\" relates to how versed one is in the checkered history of science (as a human process) and whether one functions in the ideology of physics and reductionism or are open to an emergent \\\"science\\\" - with the proviso of not jumping on each exception as an excuse to over generalize.  I recommend Steve Fuller's \\\"Social Epistemology\\\" as an introduction to the human side of \\\"science\\\".  Those who correctly point out flaws in conceptual systems are not always competent in proposing better alternative conceptual systems.  In what sense does my use of \\\"conceptual systems\\\" fit into my above schema of four frames?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-27T20:08:20+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"266075253480236\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Paul Wildman\",\"id\":\"663226452\"},\"message\":\"David ecosystems also include hierarchy nature is full of them ie food chains.

For everyone: I am a current college student who is taking time off from university to explore alternative living and learning paths (read about my project at www.eduventurist.org). I recently returned from 4 months in europe where I learned further about schools of social innovation such as knowmads, imaginheroes, kaospilots, etc from various people I met. I also visited several of the hubs after becoming familiar with the SF HUB in my homebase of the bay area. This included attending THe University Project unconference at the new Westminister HUB in London. Additionally, I learned about the world of travel, work exchange, and community from engaging with a hostel job found through workaway.info and helpx.net. This learning experience was INCREDIBLY transformative and I am currently working on processing and writing up what I learned. As a young person in our society, I see problems with our current mainstream system of learning, particularly higher learning, as well as the pieces of existing networks, ideas, and methods that can act as solutions. With an interest in self-sustaining communities, co-working spaces, learning spaces, hacker spaces, inter-generational community centers, etc. I am very interested in this discussion. I myself have been contemplating trying to start a \\\"center\\\" such as this, since I have heard from dozens of my peers that they wish for more educational alternatives, but are nervous to try something different for reasons ranging from lack of community to lack of accessible funding for alternative learning endeavors. I have spent countless months researching, interviewing, and reflecting upon what needs to be and could be created to address these barriers. Coming from the lens of a student\/young person, social innovation enthusiast, and community-builder, I would love to engage further with whatever comes out of this discussion!\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":10,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-07T01:26:31+0000\",\"like_count\":6,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"179572662130496\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jessie Yancey-Siegel\",\"id\":\"1046160184\"},\"message\":\"Sophia M Wilkus Matt Robertson\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"905455286\",\"name\":\"Sophia M Wilkus\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"544485917\",\"name\":\"Matt Robertson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":16,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-07T01:35:29+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"179577712129991\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Venessa Miemis\",\"id\":\"630505808\"},\"message\":\"i'm getting very inspired by all the responses here, and the positive affirmation is a nice counterbalance to the response i'm getting from \\\"normal\\\" people who i share this idea with - who just tell me i'm nuts. ;)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-07T01:50:30+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"179582308796198\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"http:\/\/www.quora.com\/Creative-Spaces\/Is-there-a-global-directory-of-creative-spaces?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-07T02:05:02+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"179584422129320\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"CREATING A HIGH LEVEL INNOVATION LAB ECOLOGY - notes from a session within Radical Real Time. http:\/\/piratepad.net\/Nmb8Z2kTGv\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2011-11-07T02:11:33+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"179591135461982\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Vicki Randall\",\"id\":\"1000230131\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson thanks for bringing me in too!

It would be cool to see how it can also connect with people in the local region (I guess that would be New England in general and New York in particular). Now is a particularly good time to start laying the groundwork for helping people \\\"jump the gap\\\" from collapsing 20th century systems to evolving new systems. There are so many ways that something like this could help impact thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of lives,if the activities that happened within had a focus on helping people improve their livelihoods and communities by evolving out of the existing systems they are now stuck in. Imagine if all of our work amounted to a pathway that many others could follow and help to guide each other down (or we help to guide them down). This could be dynamic, evolving, and very inclusive of what everyone here is doing. The challenge would be to put it into a context that someone can work into their lives. How would someone replace their children's schooling with learning coming from the work we're doing? How would they replace their sources of energy with energy systems that emerge out of our work? Same for food, economics, etc. How will people create sharing economies and commons around resources that are better shared than sold in a market place on local levels? This requires all new ways of approaching economics, community co-governance, etc. etc. The answers to these questions become apparent when you connect with people in communities, and put the theories into context. So it would be awesome to see that happen with this center for disruptive innovation. To see it connect with the communities that surround it and drive change in the region it is in around various things, and the product that is created is a path of practical guidance towards doing what we are talking about.

A center like this could not only brainstorm and look at what is possible, but also guide and steward the change by helping (for instance) companies learn how to create trust and found community with their customers and users, helping governments learn how to turn more control back over to their citizens, helping communities learn to bootstrap resources for themselves where others have abandoned them. \\\"Disruptive innovation\\\" in the 20th century meant a new idea or technology that always really only changed part of the \\\"game\\\".

When I lived in Peterborough NH in 1990's driving to it through Wilton NH was along river like this with waterfall with the abandoned paper mills etc on the other side.\\n\\n I always thought why are not those mills active for something and why are we Not Using this force of Nature WATER POWER that runs so freely in NE !!  Using Abandon Mills around the NE is excellent way to build infrastructure of Our research etc into rebuilding USA from the inside out. From the Emergent Beauty of rich natural resources. \\n\\nI lived all over the NE so I am very familiar with this History.. My favorite Mill area is a sweet little community outside of Hartford VT and Hanover NH.. Near Woodstock VT called Quechee .It is the site of the Quechee Gorge on the Ottauquechee River and is also the home to the Quechee Lakes planned community initiated in the late 1960s, which also brought to the community the small Quechee Lakes Ski Area in the 1970s. \\n\\nThe History of WHY Quechee was created in first place in 1700 to build Mills using this Powerful water and it grand falls to generate the Mills that made all kinds of products with the most recent being Glass . Quechee is now home to Irish glass blower Simon Pearce purchased the former woolen mill in 1980. The building that drove the village economy for about 100 years again took on a new commercial use, this time for glass blowing factory and pottery produc tion and fine dining. I believe Simon Pearce is using the Power from the Water to operate their Mill for glass blowing and pottery making  !\\n\\nStarting in Chatham NY there is potential to  start the inhabitation of building new communities as there are many empty mills and old wonderful history from 1600 1700  like this all over the North East ! Bringing life to them will bring attention to the fact these mills were run by the water power which is so glorious in aliveness ! \\n\\nQuechee was also known for a picturesque covered bridge at the site of the old Quechee mill, which now houses a commercial glass-blowing facility. The bridge was severely damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene (2011).\\n\\nThis unexpected flooding due to rains of Irene last Aug 2011 was due to having a harsh winter of much snow and ground still saturated but more so it was due to the fact our ecosystem of water movement in USA is very unhealthy due to so much is polluted as the water makes it way down the USA into Everglades for drainage out into the seas.. It is Everglades that is really messed up which is big part of problem to creating back up like this that does this flash flooding around country.\\n\\nEarly Town proprietors saw the value of river land. In 1765, they voted to grant 600 acres adjacent to the river falls as an incentive to attract saw and grist mills. They envisioned mills bringing the Town job and growth benefits. By 1774, the Town conveyed land to John Marsh providing he establish a saw and grist mill within two years. Both mills were built and operational within four years. Over the next forty years, the mill property changed hands many times.\\nQuechee Historic Mill District - Town of Hartford Vermont\\nwww.hartford-vt.org\/downloads\/492\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-03T11:19:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"336258166461944\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Cassandra Rose\",\"id\":\"100001388966789\"},\"message\":\"The author of this is  Michael Forrester is a spiritual counselor and is a practicing motivational speaker for corporations in Japan, Canada and the United States.

The man-made rules and regulations that are used to govern the people are necessary only as long as the people don\u2019t know how to live in accordance with the natural laws of life, for lack of self love. This trend is shifting fast and the turbulence that is gripping mankind is all part of it. Humankind is waking up, and there is nothing that can stop it now. Love will replace control as the dominating power of life on earth.\\n\\nThe importance of the Collective Consciousness will be attributable to the following:\\n\\nNo Government Control - The Internet is point-to-point communication. No government can control all points.No Language Barriers - Advances in software afford almost simultaneous translation across multiple platforms.No Friction - Business models based upon lack of information will fail.No Spin - Multiple access points means less opportunity for special interests to control people by spinning information.Infinite Collaboration - Think it, design it, share it, fail and start again at high speed.Commonality - People discover that they really are not that different after all, which aligns interests.\\nTraditional government will soon fragment. The existing government as we know it will change rapidly. Today\u2019s government paradigms worked for getting things done for the last century with methodologies that cannot operate with the upgraded thought processes of collective consciousness. The people of earth have decided it\u2019s time for a shift and governments will have to either adapt or be left behind as archaic and outdated controls. If they do adapt it will be government 2.0 for the people.

How will emerging leaders essentially give back enough to the system that supports them to ensure continued support?\\n\\nA: The institute will be based off of systems of mutuality rather than reciprocity. People who give to the Institute (providing housing, resources, contacts, mentorship, etc) will only give that which they have in abundance and can give freely. Reciprocity implies that one offers something with an expectation or hope of positive future responses. Mutuality operates from a basis of abundance where people who offer resources to emerging leaders do so not because they expect increasing returns, but because they offer something they can give of freely that simultaneously supports their own intrinsic motivations. For example, an anti-homelessness activist providing free housing to an emerging leader working on homelessness issues.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"587572171\",\"name\":\"Kevin Jones\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":11},{\"id\":\"725829941\",\"name\":\"Arthur Brock\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":274,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:26:35+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340893695998391\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"id\":\"904115122\"},\"message\":\"We need to learn how not to quantify things...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:29:50+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340893979331696\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"id\":\"121300030\"},\"message\":\"Suresh Fernando we need to learn how not to quantify all things\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"904115122\",\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-17T21:31:10+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"340894869331607\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Suresh Fernando\",\"id\":\"904115122\"},\"message\":\"It's also important to understand that in the modern world many people are trapped in jobs and circumstances that prevent them from doing things they would like to do like helping others.
