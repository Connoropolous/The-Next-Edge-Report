 The Middle East in one chart I am curious if anyone in this little group is paying close attention to the unfolding issues related to Fukushima - and does anyone have good data on radiation levels in the ocean (from Japan to Cali), air radiation (since the Japanese are burning and melting most of the waste around Fukushima), radiation in the fish (including Tuna and Salmon) etc. 

Also, anyone have good scenarios for if they are not able to contain the ongoing water flow what this would look like for us on the West coast?

My sense is this is the most urgent and critical global crisis facing us immediately - and I feel like most of us are ignoring/unaware of the true danger this represents for us!

Just looking for good data to help develop some scenarios. Greetings Next Edgers. anyone have anything compelling to share about the impending situation in Syria..thank you each for being here. xo One Community is designing and open source free-sharing plans capable of rebuilding the world in a way that works and supports everyone. To accomplish this we are creating what is necessary to establish self-replicating sustainable teacher/demonstration hubs that build, teach, and comprehensively address food, energy, housing, education, social injustice and inequality, and more. They also provide a more fulfilling lifestyle that is foundational to helping this model spread globally. This is our weekly progress update (#26) covering One Community’s progress and accomplishments for the week of August 19, 2013: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/rebuilding-the-world/

~ One Community I know, everyone posts their prediction on December 31st.  I put this together in 2010 - call it a 3 year check point (3:30 minutes). thoughts? http://youtu.be/hgvmH3QSlbg DON'T be alarmed, but you have alien DNA in your genetic code. Science says so. We've raised a tiny strategic patient capital (no exits needed) fund for our two platforms; the hub and SOCAP. We are doing due diligenc as mutual business development with other platform businesses. http://kevindoylejones.tumblr.com/post/59439986108/due-diligence-as-mutual-business-development This is a terrific article that brings the reader up-to-date on this critical national debate. The first part of the article asks the challenging question about where President Obama and Treasury Secretary Lew stand on the issue of pushing forward with banking reform during the remaining years of this Presidency. I found the comparisons to France’s Mitterand as well as Clinton very useful in gaining a historical perspective of the forces at play. But certainly the most compelling part of this article is the analysis of Wall Street’s political power and how banks and bond merchants manipulate access to capital for their own ends. You won’t find a better case than in this article for how to harness alternative sources of capital to serve the public good. The discussion about how some local banks such as Bank of North Dakota have gone in an alternative direction provides a glimmer of hope that we can reduce our dependency on Wall Street and establish a more diversified financial system.

I've been actively involved in what I'll call 'Freedom-Building' for about 20 odd years now.

This work has brought me from "England" to the "United States", Neo-Tech writing to Terra Libra work and Landmark courses to my current project.

I have a deep interest in business and various forms of technology and their application to solving all life's challenges.

Anyway, I'm enjoying the perspective I've seen so far in 'The Next Edge' and look forward to sharing mine and perhaps collaborating with you all in some capacity moving forward.

#Machinelearning the meaning behind words 

#Google #opensource

http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/08/learning-meaning-behind-words.html Our communities ARE currencies. I see the "Next Edge" as a (deep) currency and the people who participate in it, 'Gaiazens'. That's 'me' talking. You can ignore that. Or listen. I don't care either way. It's all about generativity and the conversation. 

But like I said, I longer see (The "Next Edge") it as something... else. Something which defines us as something we are not.  Something which makes us unique, different, but separated from the rest of humankind. 

That creates Friction. Friction and stress are things which are natural when it comes to collaboration (as it can lead to growth) but corroboration and grokking are VITAL.

The "Next Edge" can't afford to forget that, or it will become irrelevant to its own existence. 

At least to me, Your all interesting beings. You are You. We are us. I am... this, at least for now.

What's Next? The Edge is not as important as the people who become it. 

It's not about winning. It's about meshing. Ferananda Ibarra Fear-based vs. freedom-based leadership. http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/presidential-meeting-signals-catastrophic-event-there-is-a-crisis-unfolding-somewhere-in-the-background_08212013 You can't win something (i.e, the Edge) that is always emerging. You already have it. 

The Edge is the resources, commons, visions and understanding that we already have.

The point is to share it. Be the gift that makes the difference in another persons life. 

That's the Next part... to let it morph into the ubiquitous. I no longer see the Next Edge as the "Next Edge", but as a group of brilliant and compassionate people who excel about disagreeing about things, to the point that most don't notice. My friends at Free Range Studios, the master storytellers behind The Story of Stuff, The Meatrix, and the book Story Wars, are offering a series of e-workshops this fall. It ain't cheap.

If you have questions about One Community, please feel free to call in and I will be happy to answer them. http://www.wingmakers.com/index.html Indios of the Amazon: Are we killing the future of medicine? Read more at www.sustainablebrasil.com Art has always been to some degree a form of social dialogue where perspectives and propositions can be floated and acted upon democratically as a form of bricolaged popular legislation without intermediaries or proxy representatives. This aspect appears to be coming more to the fore of late. I have a car that can be autosufiscient just need some-group that can fund it no gas and it can go on & on with no charging ,just leave me a not if you want more explanation , you'll be trown of your seat Food Yield Projections (22,000+ pounds total) for each of the first 6 Houses of One Community's Phase I Food Infrastructure are now finished and added to the site here: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/aquapini-and-walipini-planting-and-harvesting/

For even more open source information, click the link above the projection summary tables to visit each of the related GoogleDoc spreadsheets with complete details. 

Hoop house production and food forest production will produce even more food. Hoop house projections and space needs are coming next - right after we finish posting the Zenapini 1 and 2 maps. We hope to have all of this done tomorrow.

Where to purchase all plantings is also currently in the works. This will be additionally helpful because many of the plants our botanist and horticulturalist have chosen are rare and endangered. In accordance with our Highest Good for All philosophy and our open source botanical garden model ( http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/botanical-garden/ ) we are addressing this comprehensively and have done the research so others can address it comprehensively too.

~ One Community i want to respond to yet another utopian revolutionary funding platform idea on FB: you are delusional and not very interesting. i am not. instead posting it here. leaving FB again. Interesting quotes from a 2009 TED talk on "the danger of a single story".

“The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.” 

cc Kevin Jones Martin Montero Are you interested in co-creating a 'social game' that enables a conversation of action?

We are entering a phase of co-designing a 'happening-hangout' where a network decides in one hour what the greatest social impact they can produce in the following week, within a budget comensurate with the size of network. e.g. 100 people gather and decide what to do with £1000. In this way, we learn the skills of alignment, consensus and collaboration, through direct social effect.

https://plus.google.com/events/cu5ecupd6fv2cisqfnptk0hcqmc

A bit like World Cafe. We are looking for co-designers now, and for potential networks to trial this *conversation of action*. Two years ago, Wired Magazine reported that Neil deGrasse Tyson would host a sequel to Carl Sagan's Cosmos which originally aired on PBS three decades ago.

The producers of the new sequel say the new series will tell “the story of how human beings began to comprehend the laws of nature and find our place in space and time.”

This also creates a parallel opportunity to review our place in the story known as “The Advance of Civilization.” Gaming the System

Politicians, lawyers, and well-heeled lobbyists are uncommonly gifted at gaming the system.

To that list, you can add sheriffs, prosecutors, judges, and other local and state law enforcement officials.

The concept of gaming the system was put on a rigorous mathematical foundation in the 20th Century, with the development of Chaos Theory, Game Theory, and Drama Theory.

It’s been more than a century since Henri Poincaré came up with his path-breaking results leading to the development of Chaos Theory. And it’s been more than half a century since John von Neumann and his colleagues developed the Theory of Games.

Today anyone whose business involves the Rule of Law understands the art and practice of Gaming the System.

The Rule of Law has been thoroughly hacked and is now well past its sell-by date.

But while the Rule of Law is now kaput, the same 20th Century mathematics that trashed it also provides the model of the successor to the now obsolescent Rule of Law.

The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded in 2007 to three researchers who developed a novel economic theory known as Mechanism Design.

Mechanism Design is a branch of Game Theory that investigates how to design economic systems which induce participants to play both optimally and ethically.

That is, in Mechanism Design, there is no advantage to Gaming the System.

Our existing legal system is manifestly not crafted in line with the principles of Mechanism Design. Indeed, it is ridiculously easy to game our conventional system of law.

In our present model, it is generally not illegal to game the system, but it is manifestly unethical because it clearly defeats the purpose of having a functional regulatory system in the first place.

Or to put it another way, we do not have a functional regulatory system. We don’t even have anything close to one.

But it is theoretically possible to build one from the ground up, using 21st Century concepts in Systems Science, Cybernetics, and Mathematics. I am not very active here anymore as focusing on survival ! But Barry Kort has a strong background in Systems thinking and has worked through many scenarios via his education in math, science     Stanford University Class of 1975 · Doctorat (Ph.

Barry's blog http://moultonlava.blogspot.com/ "It's not charity.It's empowerment." Read my interview of Cristiane Pedote, Managing Director of Barclays, at www.sustainablebrasil.com "With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves.

Loomio breaks down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.

Collaborative decision-making balances individual autonomy with the collective good." The top 20 places in the US where there should be a social entrepreneurship/innovation incubators and accelerators and impact investment funds: http://bit.ly/13VvGWS These things are most often in cool hip cites and nice or trendy, hipster parts of the cites. Often quite rather removed from where all the major, systemic social, environmental and economic problems exist. 

Here my challenge to any one who is part of (or wishes to be) of the above mentioned fields. Set up shop in one of these 20 neighborhoods. Build community there and partner with the people who have lived there for years if not generations to work on these problems and find real solutions to them. In partnership with the people of those neighborhoods. One Community is a solution model that creates solution creating models for The Highest Good of All and we just finished a simplification and update of our Purpose, Values, Mission page: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/purpose-mission-values/

We're also happy to report that behind the scenes we've finished food projections for all of the 6 houses that are part of our Phase I food infrastructure and we've finished updating the cost analysis details for the earthbag village homes, 3-dome clusters, and complete 67 home village too. All these details should be added to the site this week and we'll announce them here as soon as we do!

~ One Community: For The Highest Good of All Hey Team! We just updated our Community Contribution page that explains how a sustainable community model can provide an environment where nobody ever has to work a regular job. http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/community-contribution/ I feel this is one of the biggest benefits most people are seeking from a sustainable lifestyle. Our organization is also really focused on showcasing this as a path to engaging a broader audience in wanting and investing in sustainable infrastructure. 

Something of note that isn't included in our page is that true projections show it would really only take about 20 hours a week to keep everything operating once the foundational infrastructure is in place. The BUILD A HYBRID RBE COMMUNITY NOW group is a model focused on finding a place with existing infrastructure because it would save a ton of time and get everyone involved to the less-hours-of-input model much faster. 

In our case, however, we are seeking those who enjoy contribution and the process of making a difference enough to commit to a 40-hour model long-term as the extra 20 hours will be invested in on-going open source creation and sharing... a process our organization is purposed to engage in and lead indefinitely.

He advocated for a personal relationship with God, unmediated by a church, he declared every man a priest, and took reading, selecting, interpreting, teaching and preaching the Bible away from an expert, professional, mediating priestly "calling", and from within the context of structured rituals with their symbols, arts, and traditions, and put it into the hands of each person and their own sensibility, if not sense. 400 years later, his experiment has failed, and the most powerful, visible, and influential version of Christianity is found in biblicist fundamentalisms, which are themselves tilting toward a very real fascism. Luther would be appalled by this consequence, but he unintentionally unleashed it. SO, how do advocates of open data, P2P, sharing, and assorted post-state, post-capitalist, post-religion forms of life propose to avoid a similar outcome in the unimagined future? In what was is today's tech-driven data democracy scalable to better human outcomes?

http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html I felt inspired to write this today after a recent meeting with a pollster who is damaging the climate movement...

http://www.cognitivepolicyworks.com/blog/2013/08/09/why-most-pollsters-are-delusional/ Gift economy folks - an article linking the sociological analysis of the gift with philanthropy. What is the edge of love? Has anyone followed these double slit experiments and the impact of the discoveries... beyond the "Through the wormhole" documentary series narrated by Morgan Freeman? lol. Anyone with an understanding of or interest in multiverse theory perhaps? Does anyone believe that one could consciously choose to move into a reality where more of the electrons travel a desired/believed/willed path? How exciting... 

__Here is the share at: https://www.facebook.com/FreewillUnlimited__
"So, the "quantum physics" double slit experiment has shown without a shred of doubt that we influence our perceived reality simply by observing it with our own system of beliefs.

To summarise, electrons (energy) act like a waves and explore all perceivable paths when their journey is unobserved, but act like matter and only explore one perceived path when their journey is observed by people.

I wonder if an extension of this experiment could help people identify themselves as conscious creators, with the ability to wield free will and to choose which of the infinite realities to move into at each moment :).

A simple extension of the experiment would be to put conscious will/belief into the electrons exploring a desired path to achieve desired results (e.g. more going to the top left), and to observe the feedback to help measure growth."

As policy makers around the world search for better models of health care, consumer cooperatives in health are flourishing and new social enterprise models are emerging. Globally, there are many locally-generated membership-based health organizations that link consumer ownership and empowerment with holistic, preventative, and integrated health care. 

In Quebec, there are 20 health cooperatives running primary care centres. In Australia, there are 9 cooperative hospitals and 58 cooperative pharmacies owned by consumers, and 24 mutual health insurers. In Poland, Spain and Brazil there are many worker cooperatives of health practitioners running primary care and day surgery services. The Japanese Health Cooperative has developed networks of thousands of mutual support health groups (HAN groups) in neighbourhoods across the country. 

Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, USA is a cooperative of 800,000 consumers which runs two large hospitals, a network of primary care clinics and pharmacies, and a consumer-governed health insurance fund. It has consumer-governed structures at all levels of the cooperative, with a Board made up entirely of consumers. 

Health cooperatives like this have evolved in many countries, with no template, and no coordinated development. As an alternative to both provider-owned and state-owned health care, the consumer cooperative model in health care has great potential for development. 

An International Working Group to coordinate development of health cooperatives and social enterprises internationally has been created, and is seeking expressions of interest from consumers, practitioners, health innovators and funders in participating in its agenda. 

We would like to hear from people with interests in: 

primary care 
chronic illness management 
mental health 
local hospital and acute care services 
pharmacy 
consumer-governed electronic health records 
peer-support models for good health 
self-directed services and individual budgets 
health insurance funds and financing 

We aim to develop several models of consumer-based enterprise in health care that can be developed around the world, with supportive international networks and collaborating agencies. 

In the next 20 years, consumer cooperatives and social enterprise should be able to become as prominent in global health care as provider-owned and state-owned models.

http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/tips-success-collaboration-economy Hey guys, I wanted to share this project I'm working on. It would be of particular relevant to the other Aussie's in this group but is perhaps an interesting model for everyone to check out :)

The Changemakers Festival is coming up in November and we’d like to invite you to be part of it by organising a local event. As a distributed festival the Changemakers Festival will be made up of hundreds of events in every state and territory hosted by local organisations. These events will range from conferences to film festivals, workshops to webinars, arts events to yoga for changemakers. The event could be something you’ve already got planned that you promote through the Festival or it could be a chance to create something new.

To find out more about the festival check out www.changemakersfestival.org and hit the “host an event” button to tell us about your idea.

And if you need to raise some funds to make your idea a reality you’ll be interested in the Changemakers Festival Crowdfunding Challenge on StartSomeGood, which is offering over $5,000 in bonus funds to those running crowdfunding campaigns to fuel Changemakers Festival events.

But if you want to take advantage of this opportunity you need to be quick! You’ll need to submit your idea by August 16 and be ready to launch your campaign by August 21 to be part of it. Find out more about the challenge here: http://bit.ly/CMFchallenge Since January, all Creating the Future's planning meetings and board meetings - and today, a project debrief meeting - have been held live online, where anyone, anywhere, can not just watch, but participate. Hard to believe it's only been a few months; it has quickly become "just the way we be."  And the results? Just check out the tweet stream from the debrief meeting we had today. Total awesomeness!!!

http://www.p-ced.com/1/node/175 Great project in Oakland, if you are in the Bay Area take a look and help push this one through! more details of what happened at the P2P Foundation here at 

http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/statement-of-separation-with-franco-iacomella/2013/08/06

In summary, the following has been documented:

* Franco Iacomella has forged letters purporting to be from the Right Livelyhood Award Foundation to make sure Bea Busaniche of Via Libre could not attend two events

* he actively blocked the skype communication of Michel Bauwens of the P2P Foundation (at least 7 people) and filtered 55 strategic relationships in the gmail account of Michel Bauwens

* he faked emails by Michel Bauwens to Shareable and Zumbara Time Bank to recommend himself falsely to advisory board foundations, and then proceeded to block email communications between the organisations and Michel Bauwens

* he intercepted lecture invitations to invite himself in the place of Michel Bauwens

* Internally; he would block communications between Michel Bauwens and perceived “rivals” to block the further growth of P2P-F activities.

* he falsely claimed academic credentials at the FLACSO open university in Buenos Aires and used unauthorized signatures to obtain funding from CLACSO Does "Learned Helplessness" play a role in the broader public's attitude about politics?
 
Learned helplessness occurs when an animal is repeatedly subjected to an aversive stimulus that it cannot escape. Eventually, the animal will stop trying to avoid the stimulus and behave as if it is utterly helpless to change the situation. Even when opportunities to escape are presented, this learned helplessness will prevent any action.

While the concept is strongly tied to animal psychology and behavior, it can also apply to many situations involving human beings. When people feel that they have no control over their situation, they may also begin to behave in a helpless manner. This inaction can lead people to overlook opportunities for relief or change.

http://psychology.about.com/od/lindex/f/earned-helplessness.htm Good Guardian piece on applying systems thinking to the multiple problems facing humanity. Mapping and Story Telling are key!

I only recommend one essential book for people to read these days: "Systems Thinking - A Primer" by Donella Meadows, a brilliant teacher and author of the controversial Limits to Growth Report in the early 70s, who sadly died too soon. Every person working in an organisation or for 'system change' should read and re-read it. I often take it on trips and show it to people!

http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/revolution-underway Here's one way to spread sustainable ideas while addressing personal financial needs through a financially viable sustainable communities model. While there is a significant movement happening to move people away from the monetary system completely, computers, machinery, raw materials, insurance, etc. are items that still need to be purchased for the foreseeable future. There is also the issue of (most) people still having significant debt that they need to address. 

One Community addresses this with an eco-tourism resort model that shares the sustainable community concept while offering significant value. The model is also duplicable.  

Thanks to sustainable infrastructure, we will be able to price the One Community experience so that it is comparable to a Best Western or other mid-range hotel with the added value of including all meals (see Highest Good Food), recreational activities (see Highest Good Society), and more (see Highest Good of All page). We've just finished updating our rental revenue projections page showing our first 5 years of revenue projections: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/rental-revenue/

As a non-profit organization, all revenue generated will be invested back into forwarding our global Highest Good for All goals including expansion, starting additional sustainable models, R&D and increasing our output of open source resources, etc.

~ One Community a new Edgeryders video, video is a great way to share the message :) Why create sustainable communities, villages, and cities? It seems the most important reason is because it can provide a way of life that most people would consider more enriching and fulfilling than current models.

A new paradigm is possible and movement towards this paradigm starts with just a few people spreading the idea. If enough people want it, it will happen.

Sharing our overview page for potential funders is especially helpful: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/funding-overview-page/

http://www.p-ced.com/1/node/38 Since some of you folks know me... http://edgeryders.eu/system/files/EconomyApp-DetailedDescription.pdf

From Matthias Ansorg, the Economy App will be deployed for testing via the UnMonastery Living Lap project in Matera Italy. 4 year old Leena set out at 6am to beg on the freeway where more than 10,000 cars pass by her pregnant mother and little brother sitting on a median with their legs hanging over into the street. Whenever the traffic begins to slow down she weaves through the cars and bangs on the windows with her hand out. She saw a lady in a mercedes who looked like she had a kind face and moved vibrantly toward her car window only to have it rolled all the way up by the time she got there. The lady on the other side moved her hand back and forth in order to signal Leena to go away.

After approaching 15 or so cars, the traffic sped up and Leena, like an expert, walked in a straight line between the cars without the thought of being hit. She took a sharp right in front of a speeding car that did not slow down even a fraction while Leena bolted back towards the median to reset her walking path. Making eye contact with her mother who was sitting with her hand held out and her little brother leaning on her eating a small piece of bread that someone had given them out of his car. For her efforts, Leena had received a couple of pieces of bread and a handful of change.

Around 10am, my wife and I were riding in the back seat of a mercedes that had been rented for us along with a private driver. It was a courtesy that was given to us while we were in the country. We had just brought our grocery for the day when, while on the highway Leena spotted us in the car. Obviously, we stuck out as the Americans in the bunch. She approached my wife on the passenger window behind the driver and my wife handed her all the grocery we had. The traffic was slow, so Leena was able to make her way back up to the driver’s window.

Leena held up the bag of grocery and, in the local language, asked the driver “what am I supposed to do with this? I need money not this stuff”. Then she shoved the bag towards the driver and said “You buy it from me!”. I thought to myself, this girl is just another one of those people using begging to make money. Shame on her lazy mother. She is nothing but a liar.

Two years later I found myself walking below that highway overpass that Leena, her pregnant mother and brother sat on. I saw a chubby little Leena, slightly aged but obviously her, begging in front of the stores. She had obviously been eating all that food that people had been handing her. I took comfort that my previous thoughts about Leena were right. That some people just chose to live this life of begging in order to avoid the difficulties of living responsibly.

I looked around to see if I could spot her mother and brother. I was curious to know if she had given birth and if this horrible woman had the little baby out there as well. That is when I saw it, the truth of why Leena was on the corner, why her mother was pregnant, why they were risking their life and turning away food and demanding money. He looked to be in his 40′s, a very healthy rough looking man stood over Leena’s mother as she cowered down in fear with the small child in her hands while reaching up one arm to hand him the money from the days worth of begging.

Stupid me! how could I be so near sided? If she was still here had noone stopped to truly ask her about her true condition? My heart filled with rage and my eyes began to tear up. My first thought was to go and kick his ass. But then I thought of the consequences. Leena was most likely this man’s daughter and this poor woman had most likely been the victim of constant abuse. This is all they knew, and without the ability to completely change their life, I would just be making more trouble for them.

Which one of us take the time to really understand people’s problems? Which one of us stops on the street and drinks tea with homeless people? Which one of us takes the time to follow the prostitute back to her house to confront her pimp? Can you sincerely pride yourself on having any real impact if you do not know the depths of the people’s problems? How do you even design a solution to help someone when you don’t have all the facts? Is your social venture – really a social venture – or just a band-aid that fills Leena’s belly instead of freeing her from oppression?

You gotta touch Leena’s life to know her. I will take you www.geeksgoneglobal.com/lets-go Two Psyop Operations Targetting the P2P Foundation - They would make use of technical help or donations My final appeal for those who are up.

~ One Community Where else besides banking do you see this happening? 

"So if all this is commonplace, what's the next big disruption? In my opinion it's peer-to-peer, the ability of two or more entities to share data and do business without a central orchestrator. P2P changes everything. It changes product and service offerings, it changes how companies are organized; it fundamentally changes the business models we are used to. This is very quickly leading to a "fragmentation of everything": the fragmentation of work, of applications, of hierarchies, of states."

Thank you for all your support! More of the inevitable future of sustainable transportation... emergence We've completed all sections of the open source and free-shared curriculum component of the Education for Life program! 

The purpose of the Curriculum for Life component is to clearly outline everything we believe should be part of the human learning experience for any age. This includes all traditional subjects (math, science, reading, etc.), life skills (emotional awareness and responsibility, integrity, healthy relationships, communication skills, etc.), and subjects typically reserved for college (public speaking, business skills, psychology, etc.). Our primary goal is to provide all people, at any age, with a curriculum guide to being leaders, freethinkers, amazing, creative, and world changing people - “ambassadors of the future” - with maximum choices for how to apply themselves in the evolving world.

This is the culmination of over 6 months of weekly work by 3 members of the One Community team. Here is the portal page to all 12 categories: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/curriculum-for-life/

~ Sustainable Lives Hey Next Edgers... further to the comments below, let me know if there are any people or organizations you think I should connect with!

Amongst the various things I am working on I'm excited to be joining Colleen Hardwick and the https://www.placespeak.com/ team to take public engagement to the next level!

We're all tired of governments and related institutions not listening to the voice of the people. What movement builders need to do commit to infrastructure that will enable us to directly engage and empower citizens... to effectively mobilize them! This requires an infrastructure that supports dialogue, polling, surveys etc... at the least.

We need to be notified of consultations within our community... so that we can engage more actively and more directly...

We need to be able to identify topics that are of interest and to stimulate community dialogue on our own...

... and we need to know that those that are participating in the conversation have a stake in it... that they are residing in the communities where the conversations are relevant.

Eventually we need to be able to vote directly...

This is the first step... Here's a live interview I did today for the The House of Hidalgo Show. Topics of discussion include what it takes to design an open source sustainable village, what it means to create for The Highest Good of All, One Community’s property and permitting process in process, food infrastructure details, earthbag village details, straw bale village details, creating emotional sustainability, and more. Listen to the interview here: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/live-interview-creating-transformational-global-change-through-open-source-sustainability/

~ One Community a pleasure to appreciate Bill Veltrop and friends' innovative and visionary thinking/practice about leadership and organizations/communities. Excited to see this fresh distillation and expression of a grounded, generative and deeply loving PRACTICAL approach to transforming our systems. Live on line right now... Hey Everyone!

I'm going to San Francisco to attend the Integral Theory Conference. Read past my request to see my intent and offering. :-)

https://foundation.metaintegral.org/ITC

I'm asking 245$ for the ticket and $100 for emergency funds.

Help out here:

http://www.gofundme.com/ITCzaq

I'm super excited to be going with Gary Ruiz and connecting with Mikyö Clark to help lay foundations for a more close knit Integral Millennial community. We are interested in connecting with other resonate minds, finding the common threads that bond our group together, and having our voice represented in the larger community.

If you are in San Francisco, and want to connect with us, let us know. We will be hosting lunches and holding space throughout the conference around this intention. =D

Right now, I've been blessed to find a ride and places to stay during my visit, and am needing a support in buying the actual ticket. If I can't raise the money, Ill still go and do what I can when I get there. I'm asking for help in getting the ticket beforehand, because in doing so I would be less stressed and could focus more on the intention of the trip.

***

I want to help you all for helping me. Let me be your eyes, ears, and mouth. If you need me to ask a question, connect with someone, or report on something. Let me know. And, I extend this offer to everyone. Feel free to ask, even if you can't offer monetary support.

Lastly, if you are strapped for cash, like many of us are, you can also help by spreading the word and inviting others to this event.

~ One Community "Original Instructions" thread.  This is a spin-off from Seb's posting of the "What Would a Down-to-Earth Economy Look Like?" link.

The piece relies on a notion of "original instructions."  I agree that, from the article, it is easy to construct this as being about a kind of "return to nature, become an indigenous, abandon technology" approach.  No doubt, I think that's what many people will actually joyfully use that phrase to represent.  Another criticism of the idea could be that the idea is pre-rational, or that it is essentially religious in character.

I present an alternative explanation and challenge, in the language of the Geosphere, the Biosphere, and the Noosphere.

The GeoSphere -- this is the world of rocks, ocean, mantle, -- the physical infrastructure of the planet.  You could also include the sun and the fabric of the universal spacetime, if you wanted to go deeper with it.  But basically, the material substrate of life.

The BioSphere -- this is the world of bacteria, plants, animals, -- in short, biology.  This is where Darwinian evolution, a composite of both competition and cooperation, lives.  (I refer all those interested in the metaphorical construction of Darwinian thought to "The Darwin Project" -- http://www.thedarwinproject.com/ .)

The NooSphere -- this is the world of feelings and thoughts, of communication, signaling, relating, knowing.  Ideas and dreams live here as well.

Now, the question is, "Where do the 'Original Instructions' come from?"

I think the presupposition that many people make is that "Original Instruction" corresponds to the BioSphere.  "We're destroying nature with our technology, to get back to right life, we need to get back to nature.  This whole Noospheric thing was a mistake;  We need to get humble, stop making more machines, and spend more time with granola, if not wholesale picking up bows and arrows and put our days to remembering the names of mushrooms."  I have indeed heard this idea floating around out there.

I just don't think that's what "original instruction" is, or at least should be, about.

I *do* believe that there is "original instruction" within the biosphere, and that it is very important (a subject for another day,) but what I want to talk about right now is the original instruction **within the noosphere.**

Here's where I think people kind of go crazy.  "What?  What original instructions could reason possibly produce?  There are no original instructions in reason.  All we have is:  **Breed.**  Find pleasure, avoid pain.  You know, the Biospheric instructions at work within the human body/brain."

I disagree very strongly, though.  I think that there *ARE* original instructions inside of the NooSphere.  We just don't have consciousness about how to access it.  We are kind of like -- have you ever met a person who was completely avoidant of their feelings, or a person who was completely avoidant of reason?  I certainly have.  What I propose is that there is a similar condition, of being completely avoidant of **dreams.**

I am not talking (only) about dreams at night, but also including things like Martin Luther King's dreams, or the utopian dreams of a better world.

My argument is that the "original instructions" are the inner desire, that we all know about, for a better world.  This could also be called "the desires of the heart."

All people who ever pose an argument, are always posing an argument towards a preferred end.  A person could say, "That's so BAD!", when they really mean, "That's a really great and amazing thing!"  They just want to make sure that it is not understood to be good in the 2-dimensional moralities that are, actually, bad -- just inarticulately so (in the moment.)

My argument is that idealism, dreaming, wishing, open-hearted hope, and also intelligence, wisdom, power, communication, and all of these things -- as essentially the substance of "original instruction," as experienced in the Noosphere.

Within the biosphere there is the desire for food, sexual love, and myriad other things.

But "original instruction" does not mean, "Abandon your minds and your hearts, become a primitive," and all of that.  Original instruction can mean no less than your whole-hearted showing up and participation in life.  We need to, individually and collectively, ask ourselves, "What vision of the world can I serve whole-heartedly and completely, with my entire life?"

When you have found that, you have found your "original instruction." This is a great song and a wonderfully talented singer. The Pitch Parties in Asia are going to be something special http://ow.ly/mZ6OL According to the idea of a local living economy (which sounds a lot like anarcho-syndicalism, or might I dare say, anarcho-capitalism), would a small-town economy that thrives off of tourism pass as one? I'm finding it hard to believe that my hometown of Beacon, New York is actually thriving. What's happening? I am realizing how much I like culture design, in all its dimensions. It's the 'truth' that has eluded me all along. It's what I have been working on for the past two years and my unrelenting pursuit of it didn't make sense to anyone else. Especially with my life being ambushed with bi-polar 2 and domestic dysfunctions that literally prevented me from going back to college.

In the meantime I still tried to design and am still designing SuperHero Schools and Resilient Cities. FreeSpace Differentation Centres. Agile TerraForming. Cultural Transformation. GameShifting HotSpots. 

It does to me know. This is a quote that was posted in relationship to the CultureCon Conference last year. I tried to get it in concert with Koru Conversations and Free Money Day. 

"Culture is the sum of all forms of art." Culture is the natural cure to 
unawakening. It is what we use to 'fight' all forms of enslavement. 

It is our human will manifested into actualization. 

Like the FreeSpace. Or Heartsongs. Or Collabotories. Or Emerging Leader Labs. Or Liquid Currencies. Or MetaCurrency. Or Streamscapes. Or the New Currency Frontiers. Or Agile Learning Centers. Or Story Wrangler. Or Play Nexus. Or being Eccentric. 

I'm a MetaCodex-LifeHacker. A new breed of elementalist hacker. Someone who codes the radical and unconceptual. A culture hacker and designer. NOW THAT: is what I want to do and what I am doing now.

Differentation is my Education. It is also my Lineage. There are plenty of those who came before. And I have always kwown I am some sort of polymath. (Hence why I call myself a Polysmith at times) I also believe in polymedia and cultural liquid-aquatic polymorphism. 

It all makes sense now. I would not dare to call myself avant garde. That is someone else's job. I have enough to do. 

Is is not plain to see? It was hidden in plain sight! Wish me 'luck'!

I don't need luck though. I have culture.

The Politics Behind The New Winklevoss Bitcoin Fund, In: Fastcompany's fastcolabs,  Ciara Byrne interviews Michel Bauwens about value-sensitive design and protocollary power

"Developers don’t always consider the values embodied by the systems they build--but one peer-to-peer theorist thinks they should. We spoke to him about the politics behind disintermediated networks, and what a system’s design can tell you about the worldview of its creators." Hi Next Edgers, I'm posting this call for help on behalf of Michel Bauwens, founder of P2P Foundation (at his request, as he's madly organising this) - some of us are organising to send what we can via PayPal to a central point (tbc), in order to expedite funds via Western Union:

dear friends, this is an appeal for emergency financial assistance or a loan.

if you happen to know someone who could advance me EUR 1,500 to prepay a ticket to Paris in the next 3 days ... (return tickets to thailand are going fast, hence the urgency to secure the ticket very soon). In order to arrive in time, a money transfer service would have to be used. In the case of a loan, it would have to be repaid over time. In any case, small donations would be useful at present to bridge a difficult transition time.

I need to go physically to Lunenberg in Germany to sign a official research grant as well as other documents, (dep. 25/7) and attend on the way back my daughter's wedding party. Return has be in time before August 8.

Expected lecture fees are not coming on time and it would be really bad news to lose a major research grant on digital democracy for lack of finding the money to prepay a flight.

The reason the timing is important is that the return date is important, but the travel agent says empty seats are rapidly disappearing because of the holiday season. On a personal note, I missed my daughter's wedding because faulty ticketing had me stranded in the airport a whole night, so missing this 2nd occasion would be very disappointing.

Thanks for any support or suggestions, and write me an email to ask for bank or money transfer details.

Michel Bauwens

Most of it never has to exit the network, but of course there is also the connection to the internet we know today, and to friends who live far away... The SEC opens up hedge fund advertising as per the long awaited implementation of the 2012 JOBS bill. No mention of Crowdfunding

I wonder if this new declaration will be as far as it goes for the JOBS bill. What happened to opening up the Crowdfunding market? This decision seems to be nothing more than "more of the same" benefiting Wall Street finance.

What about a small or medium sized business that wants raise money in their local market via a Kickstarter type exchange that would offer equity instead of just T-shirts. All this does is lessen the reporting rules for the hedge funds. It does nothing for "Main Street," and everything for "Wall Street." ~ http://onforb.es/14JzCfW An absolute Must See!!

Papers and presentations are invited which examine the emergence of a New Global Politics based on the empowerment of civil society and the dispersal of economic and political power. 

Contributions are invited on both the conceptual, historical and philosophical foundations of the New Politics, and its expression in diverse organisational, entrepreneurial, and electoral projects and movements.
____________

Around the world, we are all searching for a new politics: new ways to empower citizens and communities, build new forms of enterprise and association, and develop new models of public governance. 

Throughout the 20th century, political parties, governments, and public policy focussed on states and markets, and ignored social connectivity, voluntary association, social modes of business, and self-employment. The Right worked to increase the role of the market, the Left worked to increase the role of the state. Together, Left and Right supervised an expansion of both states and markets and a steady concentration of economic and political power. 

This century of imbalance between civil society, states and markets is finally coming to an end. New forms of association and enterprise are emerging around the globe which challenge concentrations of power. They are bringing with them a New Politics.

The New Politics is in formation. It needs a new public philosophy built around the strengthening of civil society and the widespread distribution of power to displace the twentieth century's exhausted traditions. What will this new public philosophy look like? What form will the New Politics take? How will it express and organise itself?

This international conference will explore these issues, with a focus on strategic perspectives which guide the development of ideas and projects to propel this movement forward. 

It has a particular interest in four historical movements that may inform the New Politics:

1. The Distributist tradition associated with Belloc and Chesterton in the 1920s and 1930s, which sought alternatives to both capitalism and communism, based on a widespread distribution of the ownership of property.

2. The Cooperative tradition, with its vast global network of member-owned enterprises, which entered the political arena in several countries after 1917.

3. The Populist tradition associated with movements of farmers, small producers, family-based businesses and artisans, which moved in and out of political processes in various forms.

4. The Slow movements, associated with local produce, local economies, sustainability, and conviviality in human association, now emerging around the world. 
________

Papers and presentations are invited which examine these issues, either on a global or regional basis, or with a single country focus. Presentations may be papers, workshops, exhibitions, or proposals for strategic or organisational initiatives. Deadline: 31 August 2013.

Further details: http://www.civilsociety.org.au/CivilSocietyPolitics4.htm For those into politics and systemic change, this week's virtual roundtable is about as good as it gets. Lawrence Lessig anchors it and puts a hugely important question on the table: how do we scale up outside public pressure enough to crack big money's hold on politics. 

We're never had such an illustrious group of roundtable participants. Every one is a star in their own right: Internet pioneer Tim O’Reilly, Change.org Founder Ben Rattray, Moveon.org Executive Director Anna Galland, VC Brad Burnham, Executive Producer of TED Media June Cohen, Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent, and Markos Moulitsas, Founder of Daily Kos.

Some of the folks in The Next Edge have participated in earlier roundtables, and we hope to have more of you in. If you were ever going to check one out, this would be it: Thursday, July 11th, at 11 am Pacific. And you can always check out the package of videos and writeups after the fact too.

"The Tropical Atrium will be the multi-functional center for the earthbag village (Pod 1). It will be affordable to build and provide a beautiful and comfortable place to host classes, grow a diversity of tropical fruits, re-use the greywater from the showers (for both watering plants and passive heat), and it will expand our botanical garden model. In accordance with our open source goals, the entire structure is being built for maximum heating, cooling, humidity, and overall structural modification. It has also been designed so that it will be beautiful to see and use even before any of the internal plants and trees begin to flourish."

If you'd like to help us build this, sharing pages like this one is more helpful than most people realize. Sharing our Overview for Funders would be even more helpful: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/funding-overview-page/

~ One Community Updates Open source sustainable food infrastructure hub now updated, simplified, and complete! 

One Community's initial food infrastructure consists of 6 different aquapini and walipini structures that we are open source project-launch blueprinting. There are three primary designs: Large-scale Production Aquapini, Aesthetic and Diversity Focused Zen Aquapini, and the Maximally-affordable Walipini Greenhouse Design. Each of the 6 structures will provide a different internal environment and grow a different variety of food. The structures will be the Large-scale Production Tropical Aquapini, Zen Aquapini #1: Cloud Forest House, Zen Aquapini #2: Tropical Moist House, Walipini #1: Frost-free Arid Zone Desert House, Walipini #2: Borderline Subtropical House, and the Walipini #3: Tropical House. These 6 structures will be a part of our botanical garden model and will produce a diversity of delicious and nutritious food far beyond anything found in a typical grocery store. The details are on this newly updated page.

~ One Community Updates The open source botanical garden page is now complete! Botanical garden creation and propagation is something we consider for The Highest Good of All and we believe that any community can make an important contribution to biodiversity and earth-regenerative practices by adopting this botanical garden model. There are rare and endangered plants in every state, bioregion, and country of the world; if local communities become aware of them, and provide for their protection and propagation, many extinctions could be prevented, and the global web of life strengthened. In support of this we will be incorporating the infrastructure for a botanical garden at One Community and open source project-launch blueprinting the process to make it as easy to duplicate as possible so those interested can join us in supporting and regenerating the world’s diverse plant species for all the individual, environmental, and economic benefits a botanical garden can provide.

~ Transformational Education Can anyone here comprehend the below article? It attempts to show a viable alternative to money, and a justification of why one should exist, an explanation of how we can transition towards such an alternative, and provides a vision of how people will be able to live in a future without money.

I would love to hear any specific thoughts upon any expressions within the article, or questions if anything remains unclear :).

Thanks! Slavoj Žižek is at his best in this article. His culture stuff is fun, but it's more interesting to me when he sticks close to politics and economics, and reads the dynamics of symptom and repression there. For me, it's the best overview of the political economic moment I've read in ages.

http://www.lrb.co.uk/2013/06/28/slavoj-zizek/trouble-in-paradise

Reactionary criticisms of popular uprisings in the past few years fault these movements for lacking clear aims, platforms, policies and objectives. The lack of these things may be a problem in reformist times, but as Žižek points out, it's normal that revolutions don't know what they are yet as they happen - because what they "are" is itself emerging in the many breakdowns and struggles.

Today, he points out, we get uprisings, with diffuse aims, some seeming progressive, some reactionary - because global capitalism and democracy are "divorcing" (economic liberalization is accompanied by Islamicization in some places, or Confucian authoritarian paternalism in Singapore, and even single-party state socialism in China). In Egypt, there was a rebellion against a secular tyrant supported by the Western powers. In Turkey, there is rebellion against an Islamist government, but actually it's also a rebellion against increasing privatization - as in Greece. It is no longer the case that any particular political system inherently accompanies a set of economic arrangements, and furthermore, parliamentary democracy no longer seems like a functional democratic model anyways.

His quote from Brecht's ‘Hollywood Elegies’ at the end is brilliant, when Brecht asks us to consider that "God, requiring a heaven and a hell, didn’t need to plan two establishments but Just the one: heaven. It serves the unprosperous, unsuccessful, as hell."

It's a reference to Hollywood as a social region, but applies globally to our current moment. The more successful the virtuous cycle of Adam Smith's invisible hand, the more intense it is as a vicious cycle, simultaneously. It's just a single thing, not two things. Observing a global awakening seems next edgy. Thoughts welcomed :). Here's something for anyone with kids. The One Community open source Education for Life program continues to move forward and we've finished our initial population of the Teaching Tools for Life page using the suggestions gained from studying the Montessori Method, Waldorf, Orff, Reggio, 8-Intelligences, and more. Take a look and submit your own ideas to make this page even better: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/learning-tools-and-toys-for-life/

~ Transformational Education Cypherpunks unite. Technology shall liberate us.

http://telecomix.org/ One Community has completed the open source Teaching Strategies page for the Education for Life program. The purpose of this page is to develop and provide a globally collaborative archive of teaching strategies that are:
● Available to everyone
● Adaptable to almost any curriculum
● Part of a global collaboration of indefinite evolution and expansion (add your ideas here)
● Used within the One Community Education Program to teach the Curriculum for Life Component

The purpose of these strategies specifically within One Community is to create a tool that can easily be combined with the Curriculum for Life component and the Learning Tools and Toys for Life components to creatively generate endless Lesson Plans for Life in relation to any subject or topic to be learned. Others will be able to use these strategies this way too. Check them out!

~ Transformational Education Did you know One Community is also creating an all-ages open source and globally accessible education program? We are and we have just completed population of our open source foundations of leadership, teaching, and communication page of this "Education for Life Program" with the foundations of the primary alternative education systems! Check it out: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/foundations-of-leadership-teaching-and-communicating/

To create this, we have started with components from the philosophies of the well known alternative teaching methods of Maria Montessori, Waldorf, Carl Orff Schulwerk, Reggio Emilia Approach, Howard Gardner’s 8 Multiple-Intelligences, Bloom’s Taxonomy, and Study Technology. The page is not done, however, and we are now 3 weeks into additionally studying all of the greatest non-education industry leaders of communication, leadership, motivation and more!

Take a look at the page and share your own ideas with the links there if you'd like to make it even better.

I hope some of you will help, here is the plan: first we find volunteer writers and artists to create simple 15 minute cartoons. These cartoons should be culturally neutral and appealing to a wide range of ethnicities, with simple but fun story lines. Then we locate points of contact in each minority community, they will translate the cartoons into their language and find voice talent to create these cartoons. This way we can create each cartoon in all our target languages. We create 24 cartoons, each 15 minutes in length. THis will give us 6 hours of cartoons for children in minority languages. These cartoons will be completely online, so that we pay nothing in packaging and production, all services are donated and we can offer these to each minority community for free. This gives a leg up.
second phase, we find investors, and have this 6 hour box set sold to interested people outside the minority community, this could be linguists, professors, hobbyists, students, etc. With the funds we create books in the same fashion, which we supply to the minority language communities, at cost, and sell these again back to our base outside the minority language communities, we can use the funds to further produce materials for free and at cost for the minority language communities
This would feel a huge need for media that is lacking in these minority language communities, allowing the next generation to have something to look to for inspiration.
If we network and work this properly, we could eventually produce a large amount of materials, at very low cost and bring the minority languages together in cooperation. Whitehouse launches stunning inaction plan on climate change. 

Ok - so what exactly is there in the plan
I had to scroll down past a lot of graphics to find the first sort-of action but all that was is that the EPA is instructed to work with states and industries to establish standards. 
Then 2014 - promise to increase funding for renewable energy .
Then a set of goals way beyond his term - so no actions there.
Fuel economy standards - again 2018 so way beyond term
Then - yes something - 2013 increase in funding for rural energy efficiency.

There really doesn't appear to be anything significant here, no price on carbon, no caps on emissions, nothing at all within the life of this administration as far as I can see, so basically only vague goals that the next administration will reverse if they are bunch of deniers.

And far from the US taking the lead in international efforts, its taken the lead in blocking them - my memory of Copenhagen for example was that it was the US that resisted all the movement forward. And never mind the expansion in renewables that have taken place largely DESPITE lack of action from the administration, what about Keystone - where environmentalists have had to spend huge amounts of their money & effort to try and stop the whitehouse approving climate damaging infrastructure

Pretty disappointing really, and the positive response in the blogosphere just goes to show that its cheaper to spend a little of their paymaster's money to convince their supporters that they are doing something, than it is to risk losing some of the bribes - oops, I meant campaign contributions, from the fossil fools who don't want to see a carbon price and want to see keystone approved. My new favorite line ever: "Co-owning the task of recreating the world." The last of our three funding pages has been edited and updated. This page discusses exactly what we are seeking now. Please take a look and share your feedback with comments. Once we receive this final round of feedback and comments, we will begin another push with a couple specific investors that we feel we are a perfect fit for and have the means to completely fund our project. We also have a contact at NPR that we are hoping to get a feature from using these pages.

One Community is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization practicing the for The Highest Good of All philosophy as its foundation for all decisions. We design and open source free-share comprehensive sustainability components so people have access to these resources anywhere in the world. To facilitate transformational global change we are putting together all the sustainable elements necessary to build seven comprehensive sustainability village models that will provide what we feel most people will consider a more fulfilled way of living. The components of these models will be able to be duplicated modularly or as complete and self-propagating teacher/demonstration communities, villages, and cities. These communities, villages, and cities will not only be model solutions, but solution-creating models that provide even more research, blueprints, and necessary support for successively easier and more affordable and creative duplication everywhere.

If you agree with our philosophy, please help us share this page and spread the word.

~ One Community Updates We've just completed adding the "attracting pollinators" section to the open source aquapini and walipini planting and harvesting page. We've also completed the addition of another 9 plants/trees (about 25 more to go) to this comprehensive open source guide to planting this structure. Check out the great new additions: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/aquapini-and-walipini-planting-and-harvesting/

~ One Community Updates I know some of you here are interested in philanthropy and so I thought I would flag you on Thursday's Reinventors Roundtable. 

I worked for many years with the anchor for this roundtable, Katherine Fulton, at Global Business Network. Few people in the country know as much about philanthropy and its potential for change. Few people have as good a network to bring together to think this through. 

Katherine will be sure to put on a fantastic roundtable, and the people she has assembled are all top-notch. This 90-minute session could easily be a whole series of roundtables - and, you never know, it might become one. We'll be looking at all the key forces transforming the field - new tools, new resources, new metrics, etc. 

Join us at 11 am Pacific on Thursday, tomorrow. We'll be sure to add the best questions and ideas to the flow of the video roundtable. Check it out.

~ One Community Updates To all in Germany or speaking German: das neue Projekt "Berlin Innovation ConSensus" lädt alle ein, praktische Projekte und Chancenfelder einzubringen. Es besteht sogar die Gelegenheit einen Themenbereich mit zu bestimmen. Der Ansatz kombiniert Elemente aus dem Copenhagen Consensus von 2004 und dem Bürgerdialog der Bundeskanzlerin 2012. Das Fortschrittszentrum ist Botschaftspartner und hofft, dass viele soziale Innovationen sichtbar werden und gefördert werden. Prozessdesigner sind die von uns hoch geschätzten Jonathan Imme und Bernhard Krusche. Hoffentlich interessant für Sabine Amend, Bernd Nurnberger, Ralf Lippold, Willi Schroll und andere. At the edge One Community has completed 10 more plants on our open source aquapini planting and harvesting page. The goal is to demonstrate a duplicable structure that produces a year-round combination of quality, volume, and food diversity that significantly exceeds what most people have available to them at the grocery store. Our botanist and our horticulturalist are superstars. Check out the updated page to see what we mean: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/aquapini-and-walipini-planting-and-harvesting/

Can you help by sharing the campaign with people who care about food systems at a human scale...tended by humans...who are stewards for seven generations and not just for short term quarterly earnings?

Doing this work is a vocation with little to no protection....there is no "margin"....

http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/mortarboard/2013/jun/20/why-i-started-a-feminist-society Have you heard of Rippln? What do you think of it? Futurist and Design Scientist Melissa Sterry explains the goals of her project Earth 2 Hub, why she's a big fan of body-hacking, her concerns about the recent issues between TED and Graham Hancock & Rupert Sheldrake, and what it's like to hang out with Neil deGrasse Tyson. A little perspective... After first third part of this adapted version of the Les Mesereable, young Ahmad from Egypt stands on an elevated plateau and sings “the victory of the revolution is coming”. He is followed by Assaf, the Gaza refugee who won Arab Idol last night, who sings these words “Only freedom unites us. I can hear the voices of the oppressed and the heart beats of millions that become our song. Don’t fear, stand with the oppressed people, and stand against the oppressing tyrants”. Imagine a world where international organisations actively owned the consequences of their actions. What if enough noise can be made internationally that FIFA does the right thing and changes the venue for the 2014 world cup away from Brazil?

Fellow Edgers, today I'm asking for your support in one of two forms;

Join the event and invite all of your contacts, aggressively market for awareness on this issue. https://www.facebook.com/events/563911436985582/

Or,

Sign the petition and put your name behind the cause. Add your voice to the questioning of FIFA's moral values. 
https://www.change.org/en-AU/petitions/fifa-2014-change-the-venue-of-the-2014-world-cup-away-from-brazil-2# Breaking news across the Arab and Islamic World: GAZA WINS ARAB IDOL.. Well Done. The Underdog WHO CLIMBED A WALL WHEN DOORS OF AUDITION HAD BEEN SHUT Just won Arab Idol.. Assaf kissed earth then stood and thanked the CROWD from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian-Parsian Gulf and up along the Mediterranean that voted through SMS for him. Well done. Well done.. Value based identity wins today in the most troubled spot on earth.. I believe in you Cradle of Civilization.. Power to the People. Power to creative underdogs. Centralized oppressive authority take a hike. Dear all, there's a question on my mind that lingers for some time now. Supposedly we want major economic chance; how come that the topic of a Basic Income and the German and Austria Grundeinkommen movement is not covered and picked up by other countries. Thus this means we all are so biased that we not dare to openly talk, write about a concept that could,might or be willing to spark what this group and others are about. Making a real accelerating change? Enlightment has travelled Europe once. Why is economic enlightment so hard? Did we make ourselves powerless at the top of the financial game? The news and media? One can only get good concepts by experimenting and the exchange of ideas. The porting of those ideas are crucial. But somehow we face a language barrier because the German language is not the mainstream English. Are we therefore missing vital information on the edge of ideas? The mission of the James and Grace Lee Boggs School is to nurture creative, critical thinkers who contribute to the well-being of their communities. The school will be opening in September 2013 with kindergarten through fourth grade classes. Your support will fund the Boggs School’s field trips in and around Detroit!

Any help with this kind of thing would be a huge help: "There is a lot of discussion around the world about both deliberative and direct democracy. Many of us want to have both. But the most common form of direct democracy in the US is the initiative. It is in about half the states and it has major effects. And it is clearly not very deliberative.  Now cities are starting to adopt the initiative. This discussion is about whether that will serve democracy, and if so, in what sense. I think many cities are of such a scale that their initiatives will also be very plebescitary and not very deliberative. Hence I propose here a form of deliberative agenda setting. This might even be more practical at the city level than at the state level. Here are my thoughts as part of a group of essays today in NY Times on this phenomenon of the initiative spreading to cities. " (Dr. James Fishkin)

http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/06/18/ballot-initiatives-at-the-local-level/initiatives-are-not-the-best-way-to-bypass-stalled-officials The two things I like most about the Singapore governments serious approach to supporting impact investing: they are factoring in both climate risk and the risk to wealth holders of poor folks getting fed up with how the good stuff is shared. And then there is the fact that they are becoming legal home to the best Bitcoin startups. Can anyone here assist me with a line to FIFA management? 

Imagine the benefit to their reputation if they chose to stand up and change the venue for the world cup away from Brazil. The harm this is causing the under privileged is unacceptable.

~ One Community Updates To hold on to institutions that are clearly not acting in your best interest is naive at best, and fatal at worst. It is tantamount to leaning on a broken crutch.

However it is not necessary to overthrow these institutions ... but rather find other means to provide the services they were designed to provide.

And these means are us! ~ http://bit.ly/Ujn07n A Sustainable Future is Possible! One Community's weekly video progress update (XVI) to open source create it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_9q-z85m98&feature=youtu.be Written blog with images and other details coming in a couple hours...

We will be building groups of entrepreneurs (lovingly referred to as Geeks :)) from all over the world to go all over the world. 

American Geeks in Africa - Chinese Geeks in South America - European Geeks in Asia - Oh the mix goes on and on. Each trip designed to fuse collaboration with hundreds of events, conferences, co-working, incubators, accelerators and tens of thousand of social ventures and startups

This is all about cross polenization and connections. I would love to coordinate with everyone and anyone in this group on these innovation excursions. Let me know if you would like to play a part in any way. This is about making our efforts that much stronger. Creating a safe and just space for humanity.

Come on, now is the time. Please. I beg. What is an "EMPLOYTEER"? 

What I had in mind this morning was that having some formal way for individuals like myself to serve as an unpaid volunteer for some ongoing project and having unpaid volunteers work on parts of my project COULD be be structured as a way to create a "mutual benefit network" and to build personal "social credit" by volunteering and recieve benefit by posting assignments of your own for volunteers to complete.

As I am imagining it, it could be constructed as a way to construct part of a CV/Resume, build a portfolio of accomplishments and the potential to further estabkish yourown reputation with ratngs and help to further the reputation of others by posting recommendations on their page. 

I'm neither focused nor organized enough to follow through with such a project, even if it actually represented anything practical, and I can't see that it would require an entire insitutional format anyway. It could well be adopted ad hoc by anyone who found sufficient use for it, if/when and how they chose and simply be spread virally with each person/group deveveloping a customized version that reflects their needs, offers badges or whatever.

Interesting enough to talk about?

There is a limit of 10 participants, so join early and keep checking in to grab a spot as they open up. The meeting usually lasts an hour, but sometimes people want to talk for longer. Stay as long as you like.

Here's a link to the hangout on google:

To change the community you have to change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. Especially in the inner city. Plus you get strawberries."  Ron Finley The http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_finley_a_guerilla_gardener_in_south_central_la.html It's amazing how important structure and policies are; at this point, we have no all male sessions at SOCAP13. We're working on other kinds of diversity, but solving for gender inclusion this time successfully so far. Is a Transition Enterprise People-Centered ?

http://dha.com.tr/dhayayin/ "Team Themis (a group that included HBGary and the private intelligence and security firms Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies and Endgame Systems) was effectively brought in to find a way to undermine the credibility of WikiLeaks and the journalist Glenn Greenwald (who recently broke the story of Edward Snowden’s leak of the N.S.A.’s Prism program), because of Greenwald’s support for WikiLeaks. Specifically, the plan called for actions to “sabotage or discredit the opposing organization” including a plan to submit fake documents and then call out the error. As for Greenwald, it was argued that he would cave “if pushed” because he would “choose professional preservation over cause.” That evidently wasn’t the case." Dear Edgelings and Earthlings, the cultural Prince of Sweden nails it. 
http://youtu.be/-bZhJFBNvDw Surprised no-one's posted this here yet. Arguably to be expected - indeed it's been joked about by the Onion - but confirmation matters. It changes the shape of the narrative and of how much people can just ignore it. And the companies are denying it, which is interesting and means it will run and run.

We're therefore extra grateful for help sharing and liking the page because we'd really like to get these numbers back up to show the people we are engaging related to funding that there is public interest and support for what we are doing.

~ One Community Updates Hi all, would anyone have access to frequent flyer miles they would like to donate toward getting a 'young changeant' (me) to ELL in a weeks time? 
I'm happy to have been accepted on the lab and not quite willing to turn it down without exhausting all of the possibilities, and so I'm crowd-sourcing flyer miles. This is a litmus to see if people reckon its even possible to raise a 100,000 flyer miles in a week. So what do ye think, will he make it, will he fail, if you have an opinion, or can help sway the ballet, post here :) Thanks folks.

STICKS ... AND PERCEPTION

What’s a pile of sticks?

To one it’s an eyesore. “Why don’t they just haul them away.”

To another, it’s heat … or maybe even a piece of art.

And maybe to the person who put them there – it could be cleansing, a moving ahead. It’s that yard work that finally got done.

Sticks, like anything … can be anything. New hypothesis: Presence is what is left when what you think is 'you', leaves. Another big depression is inevitable! – Steve Keen on BBC HARDtalk
 - by knowledgEnabler on 2013/06/13

Avoiding through: right off the debts, bankrupt the banks, nationalize the financial system – START ALL OVER AGAIN!

Capitalism is not dead! It has been ill-gotten because of wrong interpretation of what capitalism stood! We have to listen to the evolutionary economists (post-Kenyans to understand that capitalism is still or still has the creativity to resolve itself).

We can no longer just relax!
The system has failed, not the individuals!
We need to resolve a financial mistake which has been going on for 40 years…
Debts that cannot be repaid will not be repaid!
Parasitic banks can no longer be kept alive!

Unchain the monsters slipped into capitalism!

Instability in capitalism is part of why capitalism is creative – capitalism has to resolve its own down-turn into lasting resolutions, promoting the creative instabilities, avoiding the financial destructive instabilities of capitalism.

We need to go to a harmonious society (not like the old fashioned socialist style), overthrowing capitalism and regain a society we can all trust in!

There is an essential need for political and other leaders to reverse the vision and approach from the creditors to the debtors. Politicians need to start listening to what is really breaking society as we have known it. It is becoming a dead END for politicians to be re-elected at current speed and continuation of the crisis.

An intelligent modern jubilee on debt has to happen in a systemic approach, by which to increase government created money and decrease the level of debt finance in the economy! Writing off private debts through raising government money creation and rather than given it to the financial sector (that has been proven ineffective), give it to the debtors. Personal debt is the first to be eliminated!

Implementing the systemic working process of debt write-off has to include regulations to no longer allow for banking operations to include Ponzi-scemes – no longer allowing to gamble with money, which has caused assets to rise beyond proportion (= parasitic behaviour of the banking sector in the past 40 years). How do we ensure the resilience of change makers themselves beyond chronic coping and why does this matter? 

Come help flesh out the #burningedge session and join us on October 29-November 3 at the worlds first unMonastery!

Using low-cost routers (often donated or recycled) mounted on rooftops, we're currently building the backbone of the mesh throughout downtown Oakland, from West Oakland to the Fruitvale BART and beyond!

Mesh networks are awesome because they don't depend on the existing centralized Internet Service Providers to function. Though they can be connected to the Internet as we know it now, a mesh provides a decentralized means of communication with our local community. We view mesh networks as a means of reconnecting to our neighbors, supporting local businesses, and enabling grassroots community collaboration. In the event of disaster or government censorship, an active mesh network is a resilient means of communication and sharing of information. How is "hospicing" practiced within our work at The Edge?

~ One Community Updates Thought-provoking piece by Joel Dietz. Abundant energy anyone? I have personally tested the substance described (MMS, not on malaria, though) and observed the effects Jim Humble describes in his literature. Including sickness if you take calciumhypochlorite with too little water. For me it drove away head colds in 15 minutes.

Via e-mail list.

Malaria
Finally Defeated #2

The worst disease of mankind, malaria, a disease that has killed more humans than all the wars of mankind, was finally defeated and the defeat was proven a fact by the Red Cross on the 16th of December, 2012. The location was Africa, in the country of Uganda, Luuka District.

The test was conducted by the International Red Cross, the Uganda Red Cross, the local health authorities, and other Uganda scientists and laboratories. Total scientific testing was maintained throughout the 4-day operation. There were doctors to sign off on the blood tests, malaria test strips to show malaria, and official microscope technicians to even verify the number of malaria parasites present in each malaria victim. The microscope technicians have officially identified malaria parasites on a daily basis. Other personnel present were nurses to help the doctors, video technicians, people to serve as observers, and various other personnel.

Klaas Proesmans, a prominent Red Cross figure and CEO of the Water Reference Center of the International Red Cross, told me that he had wondered if there might be some truth in the claim by the Genesis 2 Church that MMS (chlorine dioxide) actually killed malaria and returned health to malaria victims. He finally decided to personally finance a full scale malaria clinical trial in the jungle on actual malaria victims rather than laboratory rats.

Klaas Proesmans came to our seminar in Mexico that teaches the use of chlorine dioxide to cure diseases. He arrived here in Mexico about 2 months before the actual clinical trial of the 4 days that was from the 11th to the 16th in the month of December, 2012, in Uganda. He said to me at that time that he really didn’t think chlorine dioxide worked to cure diseases but he felt it was his job to prove it one way or the other. At the time of this clinical trial many diseases were treated, but the disease of interest was malaria. And 154 cases of malaria were given doses of MMS which, of course, was chlorine dioxide. All 154 cases were free of malaria within 24 hours of taking the dose, with only 11 cases requiring a second dose. This was all recorded on DVD and on paper with signatures of doctors and technicians. There was no chance of mistake. One hundred and fifty-four cases of malaria were made well. We have the original DVD’s, plus copies of the DVD’s, plus copies of the signatures or even actual signatures, and copies of all papers. All of this will be recorded on YouTube.

I would like to point out that Leo Koehof was invited to act as a MMS consultant and observer of the operation by Klaas and at one point where the operation reached a serious snag, Leo was able to point out their error and the operation continued on schedule. Leo has been a major player in the use of MMS for curing various diseases of Africa for more than 5 years. Leo saw that videos were made for the Genesis 2 Church of this entire malaria project and made sure that all records were kept safe during and after the project was completed.

There was some worry about possible side effects to people taking MMS, but since chlorine dioxide is used to purify water in thousands of municipal water purification stations and used for treating vegetables around the world, there are numerous tests showing the safety of ingesting chlorine dioxide. Millions of people have been ingesting chlorine dioxide for nearly a hundred years. At this time as many as 10 million people have used chlorine dioxide to overcome diseases. For the 15 years since I first began to treat people for diseases, there have been no recorded deaths or permanent damage to a single human being.

Some further details: I can’t praise Klaas Proesmans enough for his forward-looking, personal responsibility towards the human race. That he would personally finance this malaria clinical trial by insisting, and then financing the clinical trial, is monumental. If the information gets used, Klaas will have saved thousands of lives, many thousands, even millions of lives. These malaria victims, children and adults who are at this moment dying, are no less valuable than all the other people of the world. Who knows, one of them might grow up to save the human race. We can save them so why don’t we?

The greatest cause of poverty in Africa is malaria. The millions of sick people are needed to work in the fields. Without malaria, poverty will be almost nonexistent. Imagine if there were 80 million people sick with malaria in the US. We could easily soon have the same poverty rampant in America. So we need to save those lives.

But to save lives we need your help: We must get this information out to the world. If you never help ever again, this time humanity needs your help. Mankind must know about this development. This is one time that what you personally do will have a direct effect on saving lives, not theoretically, actually. It is so important that we get this information to our friends, magazines, newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, web radio stations, and government officials such as Mayors and Governors, because thousands of lives depend upon it.

More than 3000 children die from malaria every day. Science has proven again and again that it can solve any problem presented to it. The idea that we need to allow our children to suffer to death because there are too many people on earth is totally repugnant, but there are people who suggest it. I know that there are medical people who would spend years testing MMS while children and adults die from malaria, but ask any one of those who are dying if they would rather die than have some minor side effect that has not yet shown up. And of course, you will find that no one wants that. So since I have already tested it for 15 years, are we going to go ahead and save those 3000 who die each day or do we spend another year testing while more than 1 million die from malaria?

You know the answer to that. We have to save all that we can save right now.

But the real question is, WHAT IS THE RED CROSS GOING TO DO?

I’m not going to say a lot right now because we want to give the Red Cross time to do the “right thing.”

Let me ask you again but a little more to the point. Please, please, send this NEWSLETTER out to as many people as you can. This is one of those few times that what you do will make a difference. No matter who you are or where you are, if you will send out this newsletter to friends and just anyone, the chances are 99% the chances are 99% that you will affect at least one life in Africa. They could be saved and that would be at least one person who no longer need to suffer. And chances are very high it would be a lot more. And maybe, just maybe, the letter you send out will go to the right person and it will cause a million lives to be saved.

Please understand. Right now we are dealing in human lives. This NEWSLETTER is dealing in lives. What you do now will determine how many live and how many die. And I mean you. Of course I know there are thousands of others besides you, but you will still have a direct effect. I am not begging for a few dollars, or a couple of dimes. I am asking you for someone’s life that will cost you only a few moments of your time. THE RED CROSS HAS HAD THE ANSWER TO SAVING THOSE LIVES FOR 5 MONTHS NOW AND NOT A SINGLE LIFE SAVED SINCE THE TESTING. If enough people learn about this, a voice will go up loud enough to get something done, and there will be people who want to do things themselves to help. If you have never sent any kind of a humanitarian letter anywhere, and if you have never given a beggar a dime, or helped an old lady across the street, and you will never do a thing in the future in a humanitarian way, then now is the time to do just this one thing. Do something; send this letter out to as many people as you can. That’s all I am asking, send this letter out, please.

http://www.naklenyayin.info/ http://www.quora.com/Survey-Questions/What-do-you-wish-someone-would-ask-you/answer/Brian-Fey https://www.facebook.com/ObservandoAlObservador Economic journalist Thomas Friedman questions growth further. He asks, “What if the crisis of 2008 represents something much more fundamental than a deep recession? What if it’s telling us that the whole growth model we created over the last 50 years is simply unsustainable economically and ecologically and that 2008 was when we hit the wall—when Mother Nature and the market both said: ‘No more.’”

This is more evidence of what we are seeing as the insperable relationship (of holonic self-interest) between the part and the whole, the human and the organization, the organizational methodology and the ecosystem to which it belongs. This is not a mechanistic or distinctual situation, but a holonic relationship of complex part-whole inter-relationships. Encouraging article: http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/05/22-trillionthe-oil-backyard/ Hello nextedgers, tough question: what are the best/most advanced methodologies for value accounting, strategy and management of opportunities/value creation in horizontal organizations?

~ One Community Updates "Native American and First Nations peoples have an important tool. We are the keystones in a hemispheric social movement strategy that could end the era of big oil and eventually usher in another paradigm from this current destructive time of free market economics." How much value all the gift economies combined produce per year?
World wide, in some key countries, and/or specific markets. Can social media save the world?

http://www.p-ced.com/1/node/120 http://nirgalhel.blogspot.fr/2013/05/apocalypse-now.html http://nirgalhel.blogspot.fr/2013/05/netention-personas-development-and-open.html Last week in the UK we experienced a very public demonstration of terrorism on our streets. It's my assertion that a self-interested elite have ignoried and marginalised activism for social end economic justice at the root of terrorism.      

http://www.p-ced.com/1/node/119 Looking for feedback on a tool I have been thinking about:

I was speaking with George Por at the Economics and the Commons conference last week and he asked the question repeatedly: “How are we going to continue the conversation?”
This got me thinking and later that night I was serendipitously fortunate enough to have a conversation about Zooniverse, a site where the universe is mapped using photographs which are subsequently sorted by people in realtime as a ‘crowdsourced’ effort. They do the same with the geological features of the surface of Mars. The premise is one we all know. Computers cannot sort identify features from photos, and so humans have to do the work, so the situation is somewhat gamified such that humans sift the content and make it usable.

The same model can be applied to audio content from conferences, unconferences, meetings, events, podcasts and so on where audio is recorded intially. Then people are engaged in much the same way as with zooniverse to go through the content and transcribe it. This process is a fantastic way to learn to type and also to learn the subject material of any particular field of community endevour or study.

Once transcribed to the language of the conversation the material can then be either ‘machine translated’, up/down voted , and/or linked to similar content via tagging.

At this point people can then review machine translations and improve them.

The aim is of course manifold. For the transcriber, the role is that of community collator of information. The reward is in the learning primarily. Still I think that given certain communities, say the Commons/P2P commnunities, there should be some kind of reputation or time based accredation of the effort involved that can later be synched with the emergence of alternate currencies of value exchange.

From the community perspective we can see that the result is an ability to take segments of text, tag them according to subject material, make subsequent comment, and upvote them accordingly. This results in a tissue of quotations with the ‘cream’ of conversation rising to the top and creating the ability to create content (think ‘books’) of collaborative material. Essentially this can have the dissipative and reversed effect that the printing press had on identity with the signing of works and the condensing of the
‘homo-autographicus’ and create fully collaborative texts, tissues of quotations, such that the impersonal aspect of ‘cutting edge thought’ is consolodated into artefact form.

It also solves the question of how to save the golden nuggets arising in these settings, and allows many people to enter into the conversation and the chance to learn from and contribute to the leading ‘overmind’ of the field. I need a necessary surgery, that I can not afford, it costs 22,600 dollars. If anyone wants to help me, I can verify this is not a scam and provide the number to my doctor and to any references needed. Please help. I prefer to keep the details to myself for now, but I am more than willing to share my condition with a serious person who will help me with the surgery. Thank you. Here's a simple idea calling for a little support! Take a photo of yourself, holding a piece of paper representing your entire democratic life from this moment on - one cross for each election. It's a shockingly low bandwidth to express all that good stuff you have inside of you!

Get your kids involved, your friends - spread the word. We need better richer democratic interfaces. So let's register our protest ahead of PDF New York, PDF France and the TEDx talk at the Houses of Parliament on June 14th! What part of the Operating System for the Good Economy (OSGE) is already in software? We are starting with tech innovations coming of Ghana to find out. 

http://bioculturalresilience.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/mapping-the-operating-system-for-the-good-economy-from-farmerline-outward/ What are communities for potential future Next Edgers, but people who aren't quite there yet?

When you're having a conversation with someone who you can see is at the cusp of starting to understand and accept some of the concepts that Next Edgers perhaps take for granted (importance of collaborative economy, maker communities, social systems, etc.), what are the references that you give them or the communities you suggest they join to help them along the path to becoming 'edgey'?

Couple of my favourites are Sacred Economics and Schumacher's 'Small is Beautiful'. HELP!
I need to make a list of DIY communities and open hardware communities that operate as gift economies. Good examples are: Open Source Ecology, Public Laboratory, openMaterials...  NOT good examples are Arduino and Adafruit Industries, because they already have what I call a hybrid sustainable business model. 

I want to build this list because I want to offer these communities to look into the "open value network" model, which can help them exchange some of the value they create on the market. That is by using a "value accounting system", an Exchange Firm, and more. 

I see these open communities that run as gift economies going into a crisis. Some of them, the most mature ones, are now realizing that they've created value (some device that has market value), and that sharks are starting to turn around them. These sharks are opportunistic (classical) companies, who can put these devices into a shiny box and sell them at 10x the fair price, without giving anything back to their creators/designers. This creates tensions within these communities, and some voices are already calling for protective measures - licences and so forth. When we look at it, these opportunistic companies have all the rights to do that because there is a void that they can fill. These gift economies have no means to bring the value they create to the market, and the market needs these device. In my opinion, a model like the one adopted by SENSORICA offers the solution, which is to extend the gift economy with a market component, as well as manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page

NOTE 1: the open value network is a hybrid between an gift economy and a market-based economy. It is, in my opinion, the best compromise, one which maintains the spirit of the gift economy, maintains all the system of intrinsic motivations intact, but is also capable of offering the value created to these individuals who don't have the time or the skills to do everything themselves. The market component of the open value network funnels resources (financial and others) back into the gift economy.

NOTE 2: see more on the distinction between hybrid business models like Arduino and Adafruit and the open value network

Is it surprising to know that the average "Arab" mindlessly consumes American media products like "The American Idol". But this time, this is taking an interesting twist: The two young people competing for the "Arab Idol" now have "underdog" stories defined by tragic current affairs that influence collective consciousness in that part of the world: Gaza under Israeli siege and blood shed in Syria. http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/maysoon-zayid.html cc.

* The Soldiers who died serving our country
* The Patriots who died protecting their country, from those who serve ours
* The Civilians who died in the fighting between the Soldiers and the Patriots
* The Mothers & Children killed by the Poverty created by War
* The Politicians who sent the Soldiers to kill the Patriots
* The Companies whose theft of resources causes the need for war
* The Companies who make the Machines of death and destruction
* The Companies who bought the Politicians so they could profit from the war
* The Engineers who built the Machines for the Companies
* The Soldiers scarred by killing the Patriots and the Civilians for the Politicians and the Companies
* The Priests who think "thou shalt not marry someone of the same sex" trumps "thou shalt not kill"
* The Churches who support the Politicians who kill while professing their faith.
* Us who vote for Politicians who pursue wars in our name
* Us who worship in the Churches whose Priests fail to speak out against killing
* Us who buy the products of the companies
* Us who pay taxes for the Politicians to give to the Companies and the Soldiers

A day to remember those who die by war.
A day to remember those that cause war.

I have been stalling on making new business cards for myself and part of what keeps tripping me up is titles -- once I start making titles for myself I feel like I either have too many or too few. 

Then I have considered simply having no titles at all, just name, links, info.

And/or there's the possibility of a quote, or quotes.

If you were to give me a title or titles, what would it/they be? Any thoughts on the having of titles vs not having any? I appreciate your candor/ideas/suggestions!

~ One Community Updates He makes a really good point about the change in attitude and the sort of questions it raises about the future. Entrepreneurs define risk differently. Not doing it is risking the prospect that nothing changes. Entrepreneurs break things to create value.

https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fshar.es%2FZBl0I&t=Entrepreneurs+Define+Risk+Differently "... corporate leaders need to ask themselves 4 questions if they hope to lead the new economy:

Do I understand the feedbacks in my market?
Which ecologies am I in?
Do I have the resources to play?
What games are coming next?

Now, there are many answers to these questions but I think there is a really easy rule that all these companies seem to exhibit -- the feelings of Wall Street is only slightly material, if at all, to their plans.
Wall Street is useful for getting money to do what they want. But as for advice, well, Wall Street can pound sand for all they care.
The companies I mentioned all understand one thing -- Wall Street is not a feedback. They know that their ecologies depend on empowering people, not making Wall Street richer. They generally create their own resources by their own creativity than by relying on Wall Street to provide the know how. And they know what games are coming next because they are creating them." -- Richard Gayle

Friday night public talk! Open to all for a low price!
Weekend workshop: scholarships available!

http://carboneconomyseries.com/workshops-2012-2013/gardening-like-the-forest-workshop/ http://m.guardiannews.com/science/2013/may/23/eric-weinstein-answer-physics-problems Hey, fellows on the edge. I backed this crowdfunding campaign today. Scott is a smart, dedicated guy working towards a truly sustainable economy and his young organization needs a big boost. Can you join me? Hello everyone!

We are doing a thunderclap.it campaign for the orchard we are working to save out here in Eastern Oregon. Thunderclap is a tool for social media campaigns. We need to find friends who will commit to sending our message out via this tool. It's super easy to sign up and it will be a MASSIVE help to the Cordtz's who are TONIGHT - again - trying not to fret over the sub freezing weather coming in to the valley. My chest tightened up as I covered up my vegetable starts thinking about what is left of the orchard.

Growing food is a shockingly tenuous career. People do not do it to get rich. It's incredibly hard work. So many in our area are living in fear tonight of losing their livelihoods.

IF you use Facebook (yes!) or twitter you can help just by signing up to this thunderclap campaign. No donation is required. The folks at the orchard are busy tending their land - They do not have a lot of time to be online. We can be of great service to them by getting this message out.

Can you take two minutes to sign up for the thunderclap? It will be an immense help to their campaign:

We have until Jun 05 at 12:00 PM EDT to get 100 people or more to sign the pledge here:

https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/2275-save-our-only-organic-orchard

IF we do not hit that target - the message does not go out. So it's a challenge and it's ON!

To learn more about the orchard go here:

For anyone that would like to help us there are 3 HUGE ways we could use your assistance. As part of this migration we have simplified all the URLs, streamlined navigation, and are attempting to post an edited and updated page a day for feedback, questions, and comments to make the site more usable and easy to understand and navigate. The three ways we could really use help are:
1) Reading the pages as we post them and just commenting here if you find any edits
2) Reading the pages as we post them and asking any questions that come up so we can make the site as clear and comprehensive as possible and further the development of the "Frequently Answered Questions" section we're adding to the bottom of every page
3) Liking and Sharing the content if you like and/or support the ideas and would like to see them spread.

#3 is especially important to us at this moment in time because transferring the site led to us losing ALL of our "social media love" in the form of likes and shares (some pages had over 200) as these numbers were all reset to "0" when we moved the site. We're therefore extra grateful for help sharing and liking the page because we'd really like to get these numbers back up to show the people we are engaging related to funding that there is public interest and support for what we are doing. 

Thanks everyone for all your support and help!

That last one, "impossibe", flies in the face of how I see an expert. An expert in a subject by definition knows what is possible and knows the limits of his knowledge. Does not need said keywords. Embraces logic we non-experts can follow and stays clear of any of these:

What was once "onecommunityranch.org" is now: http://www.onecommunityglobal.org/

For anyone that would like to help us there are 3 HUGE ways we could use assistance. As part of this migration we have simplified all the URLs, streamlined navigation, and will be additionally simplifying and posting a page a day for feedback, questions, and comments to make the site more usable and easy to understand and navigate. The three ways we could really use help are:
1) Reading the pages as we post them and just commenting here if you find any edits
2) Reading the pages as we post them and asking any questions that come up so we can make the site as clear and comprehensive as possible including the development of a "Frequently Answered Questions" section we'll be adding to the bottom of every page
3) Liking and Sharing the content if you like and/or support the ideas and would like to see them spread.

#3 is especially important to us at this moment in time because transferring the site led to us losing ALL of our "social media love" in the form of likes and shares (some pages had over 200) as these numbers were all reset to "0" when we moved the site. We're therefore extra grateful for help sharing and liking the page because we'd really like to get these numbers back up to show the people we are engaging related to funding that there is public interest and support for what we are doing. 

We'll additionally continue posting all the new open source infrastructure and design details as well as we continue to develop them and complete them piece by piece.

Thanks everyone for all your support and help!

Pushing this from my personal wall. Seemed like a TNE conversation. I want to help build a community of social impact leaders and changer makers who are I-5 corridor operatives. I have some ideas for the structure, but it's an early impulse. Welcoming input. This is a long game concept.

To be clear, I'm talking about people who are regularly active in more than one of the 5 major change leader west coast cities (south-to-north: LA, SF/Bay region/Portland/Seattle/Vancouver) and the more rural centers we rely on for our work (the ones I know off the top of my head: Whidbey Institute and Hollyhock, but I know there are others around Big Sur, etc.)

PS: The impulse here partially comes from my experience in the DC-Philly-NYC-occasionally Boston corridor culture. Lots more to say, but I'll leave it at this for now. I want one of these - I ride an electric bicycle, and love it, especially in combination with public transit, but its bulk means I often leave it at home, especially if traveling at rush-hour and using public transit for part of the trip. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152684006950694 You are the result of trillions of cells working together in collaboration.

http://www.salon.com/2013/05/14/can_you_patent_someone_elses_genes_partner/ The conspiracy mindset does seem dismal, and goes well with a scarcity mindset.  I prefer the mindset of the incorrigible optimist, the abundance mindset, where I see myself and my frends as one big pronoia conspiracy.  After all nature is itself a conspiracy, the very word suggests that we breath together, all of nature breathes with all the rest of nature.  So I see a kind of conspiracy of people conspiring to do good, conspiring to create the future, conspiring to raise awareness , conspiring to set our collective intention, conspiring to shift focus towards an abundance mindset, conspiring to do away with the engrained habits of dysfunction, conspiring to build a better world, conspiring to uplift one another, conspiring to break the cycle of suffering, conspiring to elevate humanity , conspiring to chart a course to utopia rather than oblivion.  By all means if there isn't a conspiracy then let us start one.   Let us who have seen a better way come together and lead the way into a new age of abundance....

Dear Wall Street Journal,

I am writing you in shock and dismay at your article of May 8, In Defense
of Carbon Dioxide. Mssrs. Schmitt and Happer are sorely misguided, and way
out of sync with the rest of the scientific community, in trying downplay
the effects of CO2 pollution on our atmosphere. I would respectfully point
out to them both that:

* observations of the earth's temperatures and weather patterns have shown
consistent WARMING, globally. Claims to the contrary are pure fantasy.

* the earth's atmosphere is slightly more complex than a commercial
greenhouse - for one thing, the increased levels of CO2 in our atmosphere
cause increased moisture, which wreaks havoc on rain levels and weather
patterns

* every major scientific society in the world has confirmed that, in fact,
there IS a correlation between CO2 and climate disruption

* our human civilization was built on a set of environmental constraints
that are about to be radically altered by all this extra CO2. So while
dinosaurs and pleistocene-era plants might have found a hot earth comfy,
and while they might have been unphased by the radically different
coastlines and geography from those we all know today, human beings and the
billions of other life forms (C3 and C4 systems notwithstanding) with whom
we share our current-day planet may find it hard to adapt to such a
radically different climate, with such a radically different geography, in
such a short amount of time

* the RATE of change we are experiencing due to CO2 pollution is the most
significant problem we are facing. It took the earth millions of years to
get hot the last time - but this time it is happening within decades.
Plants and animals, even those as clever and adaptable as humans, are
unlikely to survive such a massive and cataclysmic change happening in such
a short amount of time.

* while plants may do nicely with increased CO2, the oceans can't keep up
and are rapidly becoming acidified, with terrible effects on marine life.

* analogies to crop yields during the dust bowl are disingenuous and
totally irrelevant - crops planted during the 1930s were utterly different,
genetically, from the crops we plant today. The amount of CO2 they are or
aren't absorbing is the least of their differences.

To publish such a load of nonsense, at a time when CO2 levels have reached
cataclysmic levels, is nothing short of criminal. These two gentlemen are
either delusional or in the pocket of big oil, or both. Mr. Schmitt in
particular, as a former astronaut, should be particularly ashamed of
himself. As one of the few people given the privilege of seeing our fragile
spaceship Earth from space, he should be doing everything in his power to
protect life on our planet - not sabotage the work of so many who are
trying so hard to save it.

Sincerely,

Vanessa Warheit

Your thoughts?

http://www.salon.com/2013/05/12/jaron_lanier_the_internet_destroyed_the_middle_class/ Just how bad is the first post bitcoin bubble hack going to be...how shocking and how much will people lose? I saw the dumbest tweet about it today.... "Bitcoins are the only form of wealth the government can't confiscate from you." 

HERP DERP The Universe often times makes me chuckle. Having decided to make MindTime open source as a global standard for understanding people, and opted to use kickstart to fund the effort to launch this, what do you think the email I got from kickstart said? Given that we map people within the framework of time . . . well, what do you think? Wow!! Does anyone know anything about podcasting? We're trying to develop a strategy and identify a platform to use. The best user interface I know: How can we find out whether useful seeds of sustainability and employment get hidden here? Thousands of inventions government-validated and hidden by secrecy orders. 

"So is the next Google hiding behind a secrecy order? It seems highly unlikely, but because of the shroud of secrecy, no one can know for sure, said science historian Alex Wellerstein.

He said even one hidden technology carrying possible benefits for society that are not defense-related is enough to undermine the purpose of patents — encouraging invention. He and other experts want at least the criteria used for issuing secrecy orders made public."
http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/04/gov-secrecy-orders-on-patents/ Be careful what you wish for! "Unintended consequences ... gun control's Pandora's Box" ~ bit.ly/16u0CDe Knowing people here to be receptive, mature and intelligent, I have spent a while formulating my thoughts in anticipation of offering a, generalised, idea or what could possibly be some useful advice. 

First a small disclaimer; if you're not a fan of philosophical meanderings please feel free to just skip right by. 

At first I found myself wondering why, at times, I had difficulty following some of the discussions that happen here. This lead me to considering if I had lost some of my own mental faculty or if it had more to do with how the ideas were presented. This is not a question easily answered, so I have decided to address both conclusions. As my journey to evaluating ongoing mental faculty will be a personal one, I have but one small thought, small discussion to share here.

At times people use words frivolously, which I understand, I too enjoy words and the benefits of having a large vocabulary. That said I would like to present an analogy; words are rather like traditional currency (and should be spent wisely). When we consider money as barter representation we are left with something that represents much more than it is itself; instead of actually carting my 100 chickens to your place of business, I bring a piece of paper to represent those chickens. Words can be said to have the same, intrinsic value, especially adjectives. 

Applying Occum's razor to vocabulary seems to work well for me, especially in regards to clear and concise communication. I feel this is important here because the great minds that casually cruise around these threads are attempting to communicate very advanced thoughts. 

Anyway, that is just my two cents for the morning, the product of late night mental ramblings. 25% of the world's population is between 16 & 30-- this cohort
a- can read (90% literacy)
b- increasingly has cell phones and is online
c- is unemployed more than their parents (in the industrial countries, at least)
d- is at risk of climate impacts, including pandemics, high food prices and resource wars

Can they use the new technologies to "unionize" and act in cooperation with each other for their common future? I came to the realization, that many games like Apples to Apples or Taboo could be used to simulate or even ACTIVATE ideas like Liquid Democracy. 

It is just in their nature. 

More details soon (enough). A good look at developments in a sector of human experience apparently little understood in many circles (including this one). The occupy generation and interspirituality:

-- Julia Ward Howe

In an era of increasing global chaos, how might we continue this work further?

MOTHER'S DAY PROCLAMATION
~Julia Ward Howe

"Arise, then, women of this day! Arise all women who have hearts, whether our baptism be that of water or of fears!

Say firmly: "We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.

We women of one country will be too tender of those of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says "Disarm, Disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice."

Blood does not wipe our dishonor nor violence indicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plow and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of counsel.

Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take counsel with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, each bearing after their own time the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women without limit of nationality may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace."

Trans humanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as study the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies. They predict that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit the label "post human". Trans humanism is often abbreviated as H+ or h+ ("humanism plus").

IMPORTANT EVENT for the p2p economy: 

Tomorrow, Mai 1th, 8 teams of business students from 8 different Universities from around the world will present their reports on SENSORICA. They have been studied SENSORICA intensively since last Sunday, helped by their respective professors and by 4 coaches from HEC (Montreal business school). Their mission has been to understand the "open value network" model, to identify (potential) problems, and to propose solutions. No stone has been left unturned. We have offered these teams total transparency, including access to our financial data. They have analysed our open value network along 4 main axis: finance, marketing, entrepreneurship and human resources. We are open to their constructive criticism and will consider, very seriously, their recommendations. 

If everything goes well with the technical team this event will be streamed live over the Internet, starting at 1pm, Montreal (Canada) time, here http://igchec.com/ 

If you are in Montreal, you can participate in person at Decelles Building, 5255 Decelles Avenue, Montreal, Quebec (look for IGC or International Graduate Competition). For those of you heavily involved in nonprofits, here's a story that might upend your assumptions about how to fundraise. 24 nonprofits crowdfunded together raising $80,000 in a day. Here's how they did it:

"We are living the paradox that we need radical answers but, however, we must adopt methods that are familiar to the status quo, to eventually generate the disruptive change."

"It is meant as a diverse, constructive interaction channel between European young people and our democratic institutions, and designed along theprinciple of Internet-enabled massive open collaboration. Its goal is to produce a shared vision of how Europe’s young citizens could claim a stronger influence on our common future – and a larger share of the social responsibility that goes with it."

WE ARE THE HUNDRED PERCENT.

ExSt: "How can we as artists work with the information that we're given. Why is non-informational media so crucial in making this movement really work?"

VR: "Because activists so often think that, you know, the facts will be enough. And they really aren't.

Because we're bombarded with facts. And the facts are really depressing, too, if you just look at the statistics. If you want to know how bad things are, they're bad. They're worse than you actually know. You want to talk to someone who's depressed? Talk to a scientist. So the facts are really bad. But at the same time, there's the idea of hope and the human heart.

And art can really reach the heart.

And the hope, I think, for humanity and the planet, lies in a paradigm shift, a consciousness shift -- because all actions begin as thoughts. We need to affect people on a deep level -- dare I say a spiritual level -- and that's what art can do."

It also argues for corporations making a profit from solving social problem, ie Profit from Purpose.

"Between two and six thousand years ago something unprecedented began happening in about six separate places around the world: The people of small chiefdoms in places like the Nile Valley, Mesopotamia, the Peruvian Andes, Mexico, China, and the Indus Valley began uniting to form the first large centralized states. It’s not known what triggered these transformations. There were no scribes yet to record the transition from villages to states and, until very recently, there wasn’t enough information about these first complex civilizations to make detailed comparisons." The Journey Network (www.journeynet.net) is a new project with a big dream of offering an 'educational platform' for the journey that is not so much supported those days - the heroic, initiatory journey of uncovering ones true self by taking distance, looking beyond the status quo and deeply inside. 

We're looking for 10 courageous seekers to prototype with us this summer.

Some of them may "pop out" or "come to mind" when a novel or unexpected event crosses his mental threshold. Some sort of catalysis has taken place. This all indicates dependence of the gift of serendipity upon the total (even forgotten) knowledge and training of the individual.

The movement grows, despite (for example) the impacts of Islamophobia on communication across cultural differences. (btw imagine a 10-20 year transition based on fundamental policy changes like pricing carbon.) What sorts of problems are you trying to solve? There are two types of problems:
1. Regular problems (of which there are a very… very large number!)
2. Metal level problems… aka ‘systemic’ problems

What is a metal level problem? One that, if solved, can provide more capacity to others that are trying to solve problems. Or… ones that, if solved, provide substantial leverage. 
Meta level problems are much more complicated and require 

1. The engagement of a wide number of constituencies
2. Us to challenge our assumptions… to ‘think outside of the box’

Two meta level problems that I am interested in are:

1. How do we mass mobilize… really come together as one?
2. How do we solve the chronic problem of the absence of resources for change agents? http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay13/different-economy5-13.html Geeks Gone Global Africa 2013 Day 2 - Seeking White House Alignment http://ow.ly/kHG9F Dear Students/Graduates,

~ One Community Updates What does living courageously mean for you? Does courage matter, or is it an old-fashioned concept? Tell me more about the "edge." We live in this world together.

https://www.upworthy.com/a-ted-talk-that-might-turn-every-man-who-watches-it-into-a-feminist-its-pretty-fantastic-7?c=mrp1 YEY!  We are getting ready for the next spiral of Emerging Leader Labs. Come play! The-Essence-of-Society-Is-Peacemaking: On the Centrality of Physical Space

One might ask why, at this particular juncture, am I working on developing the SGEI concept? This seems like a fair question especially in light of the fact that I have done so many things in my life…  build a $30 million brokerage business… a investment banking group… worked closely with revolutionaries activists and movement builders during Occupy and on subsequent anti pipeline/tanker activity…

The reason I am working on SGEI is that what change agents need is a sustainable physical footprint. Why?

One thing I learned during my Occupy experience is that our experiences of the world, although similar in the ways in which we have been oppressed, manifest in vastly different ways. We have radically different life experiences that result in our framing problems in different ways. We might view the issues from a race based perspective, a feminist perspective, a class perspective etc… We might, at some level, recognize that the source of our struggles originate from similar places, but we nevertheless find it difficult to think beyond our own perspective and short term priorities.

My experience is that there is a very large gap between the desire to work collaboratively and the ability to work collaboratively.

Collaborative work is very human work. It requires developing trust…

Trust requires Time and Patience   

Time and Patience requires Presence in relation to each other

Space needs to be our number one priority because it is in showing up every day to the same location that we will really get to know each other.

It is in this context that we will see who shows up every day… who treats everyone else with kindness and respect.

… who is working on projects that might be a fit with my goals… hopes… dreams…

… who I might be able to work with on some far fetched idea currently residing in the back of my mind...

It is SPACE that allows to unseen and unexpected to EMERGE… Have you constructed a life constrained by limitations and the restrictions of others – constrained by ..."Fences!"

www.ComeAliveWith.Us Wondering what your thoughts are on this hybrid education model.   

The idea comes from a former Internet executive who thinks social interaction is as important as the kind of customized learning that high-tech online classes promise.

The school—named after the Roman goddess of wisdom—is still in its planning stages and isn’t scheduled to open until the fall of 2015. But it has already raised $25 million from investment firm Benchmark Capital, making it one of the best-funded higher education startups of its kind, and announced a yearly $500,000 award that aims to be a Nobel Prize for teaching.

~ One Community Updates Hey all, did you catch the new PewInternet report on civic engagement in the digital age? Here is my stats summary: http://bitly.com/pewcivic

Here is a Facebook group to go in-depth:
  https://www.facebook.com/groups/newvoicesdigital/

It suggests to me the "Next Edge" is going to be less equitable if we continue along the same path. Here is one stat from the report with my editorial:

Very Good: In 2012, 43% of SNS users decided to learn more about a political or social issue and 18% took action involving a political or social issue based on that they read on those sites

Not as Bad: The racial gap in “learning” about issues is less here than in other areas (of digital civic engagement) – the 43% breaks down to 46% of Whites, 38% of Blacks, and 34% of Latinos

Really Bad: Taking action based on SNS “learning” drops almost in half from 20% for Whites and 12% for Blacks and 11% for Latino

...

If action is what leads to power and influence, we have serious problem looking for some innovative and equitable solutions. Nonconformity is the road to success! 

"Find your own weirdos, and amplify them" ~ http://bit.ly/10VgblZ It's good to remember As some members here are aware, I'm devoting my energy/life towards creating real liberty through www.freewill.im. The Beta release of the portal will be live soon :D, and I am now seeking help to identify how best to develop the next stage.

Users will be able to sell products and time through the web portal, with 10% being used to offer $0 products on a fair access basis (share more time with other users over shared interests = increase ability to access to limited offerings), and to fund users shared Dreams.

The challenge currently faced is deciding how this 10% should be collected from sales made through the web portal?

Should Freewill process the payments somehow and then pass 90% on to users, or let users collect the funds and then try to collect the 10% after, or is there an even better way? The more details and reasoning that can be provided the better.

The key to constructive conversation is perspective, especially having the perspective of that of the person you're trying to communicate with. All too often, in fact most times, we become myopic. We look at things only the way we always have, influence by people that are, well ... like us. It's easier that way.

Maybe it's time to break away from this myopia. In other words, we need to create our own personal Renaissance. ~ http://clayforsberg.net/2010/09/09/the-medici-effect-2010-version/ Here's the One Community written blog of progress, new design images, links to new open source pages, the video blog of the same information, etc. for the last week: http://www.onecommunityranch.org/how-to-help-humanity-for-the-highest-good-of-all/

http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672447/why-on-earth-would-apple-sign-onto-the-volkswagen-ibeetle#1 When you see progressive change happening in the world, what assumptions do you see at work, creating that change?

I noted in a comment in a thread started by Venessa Miemis that from our own research and development work, we have found a core of 6 assumptions that have, across the millennia, led to significant and permanent progressive shifts, and that we have labeled those assumptions The Pollyanna Principles. 

I noted in that thread that we (myself and Creating the Future as a living laboratory) are continually seeking to determine "Have we missed anything?" and "Is there a 7th or 8th or 9th assumption?" and "What are the sub-assumptions within those 6 - or 7 or 8?" and etc.

And so I'm asking here: When you see positive, progressive change happening in the world - in the present, or over the course of history - are there assumptions at the core of that change that are NOT represented in these 6 principles? People say it can't be done, but then they said man would never fly. Special reduced rates (and I have a number of free passes) for edgers http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/view/news/foundation-reveals-details-behind-new-market-driven-run-clean-mechanism-for-the-economy-58438 http://www.p-ced.com/1/node/93 Investment Management 2.0: Yasuhiko Genku Kimura From Solution to Resolution (2003)

Einstein's oft-quoted saying, which states in effect that a problem cannot be effectively solved at the same level of thinking at which it was created, does not address the most critical question: how to transcend the level of thinking that created the problem. Einstein himself, however, with his two 1905 papers, not merely solved a set of problems vexing the world of physics at the turn of the 20th century but also, more precisely speaking, resolved them by proposing a new vision of the universe wherein the laws of physics were invariant, the speed of light was constant, space-time was relative, and the ether as theretofore supposed was not required. Thus, Einstein demonstrated through his work what it meant to transcend the level of thinking that had produced the problem, which was resolved at a higher level of thinking.

There are two distinct approaches to problem solving: the atomistic approach and the systemic approach. Our normal approach to problem solving is to seek to formulate a solution particular to the problem at issue. This is the atomistic approach in which problems are identified locally in isolation from the whole system and particular solutions are formulated to solve them. A solution thus formulated requires for its existence the very existence of the problem to which it is a solution. For, to have an existence means to have an identity. Therefore, the solution's existence is tantamount to its identity as a solution to a problem. That is, the atomistic existence of the solution depends on the atomistic persistence of the problem. No shift in worldview has taken place; the problem and the solution co-inhabit the same world wherein the problem has arisen in the first place. Besides, solutions atomistically formulated tend sooner or later to turn into additional problems to be solved.

There is a different approach to problem solving, the systemic approach, which involves a higher level of thinking than the level of thinking at which the problem in question was created. This approach requires (1) that we envision a whole new world or a whole new system wherein the problem at issue does not exist to begin with, and (2) that we take necessary action to systemically and systematically create that new world. Another of Einstein's insightful statements, that “imagination is more important than knowledge,” directly addresses the difference between these two approaches to problem solving. In the symbolic space of images and concepts, creative imagination constructs a future, whereas informational knowledge reconstructs the past. When faced with problems, we habitually seek solutions inside that which we already know—the domain of our knowledge. However, the kind of knowledge we have, the kind of being we are, and the kind of thinking we use constitute the kind of world we inhabit, which produces the problems we have and the solutions we formulate.

The systemic breakdown of integrity that underlies the existing problems of the world is symptomatic of the kind of world we inhabit, and is therefore symptomatic of the kind of knowledge we have, the kind of being we are, and the kind of thinking we use. To resolve this systemic breakdown of integrity, we must create a new world where systemic integrity and coherence is present. Viewing a particular breakdown of integrity as a holographic manifestation of a systemic breakdown of the whole, we can systemically approach a particular problem. However, even when we deal with a particular problem, we must first envision a whole new world wherein breakdowns of integrity are absent and systemic coherence is present.

In the systemic approach, as Einstein demonstrated in his work, we envision a new world, a new universe, free of the problems at issue. The difference between the worlds of scientific theory and human action (praxiology) is that in the latter the envisioning of a world wherein the problem does not exist is not the end point as in the former but it is the beginning of necessary action for the realization of that world.

The vision of that new world beckons people to come forth in alignment. The intention to create that new world engenders alignment. In envisioning a world wherein the current problems of the world do not exist, we have resolved the problems inside the symbolic space of imagination and ideation. This symbolic resolution of problems through envisioning evolves into an aligned resolution for the creation of that world in reality.

As the new universe envisioned by Einstein required a new set of mathematical equations, the new world envisioned by an alliance integrator requires a new set of praxiological equations proper to that world. That is, the principles of human action and the design of human alignment for the realization of a new world need to be those of that new world, not of the current world, in order for that world to become a reality. We are required to be and to act in accordance with the principles and designs of the envisioned world, not of the current world. Gandhi said this eloquently: “Be the change that you want to make.” We must be before we can become . This also corresponds to the profound but seemingly paradoxical Buddhist insight that to reach the other shore ( nirvana ) from this shore ( samsara ) one must come from the other shore.

Opinion by nature is of this shore, and therefore no opinion, no agreement, will ever lead us to the other shore. It is aligned intention alone, empowered and enabled by the vision of the other shore, which can lead us to the other shore. Designed order of creative alliance comes from the other shore. Spontaneous order unfolds in the intentional re-creation of the other shore as this shore. Alignment evolves in the creative dance between the designed and spontaneous orders. Aligned, we remain in but not of this world, because we are of the other world of our envisioning, for the creation of which we are together engaged in transformative action.

~ One Community Updates --- WHAT A SHAM --- SHAME ON WHOLE FOODS --- BOYCOTT GMO ---
When I first heard whole foods had announced that it was going to unfold a plan to require all 300 of its stores to label all food containing genetically modified ingredients I admit, I got a little excited. Finally, I thought, a major player is standing up to these biotech giants that are laying waste to our biosphere in such an insidious fashion! The plan, we are told, is to be phased in over the next five years, at which point all products that contain GMO would contain information on the packaging for all scrutinizing eyes to see. Then I watched this video. I can't believe I fell for this marketing trick. What a scam, duping unsuspecting consumers who are trying to eat healthy intentionally conducting an under the table handshake with Big GMO companies.

https://vimeo.com/59319130 Hello Fellow Edge Members,

After 3 long years, I've finally released my book, "The Producism Manifesto: A New Game For A New Economy" and I would like to share it with this group and get feedback.

You can read the entire version online by paying with a tweet, facebook, or linkedin post

Thanks in advance for any feedback you can offer!

http://producism.org/manifesto Edgers, 

so here is both a question/challenge to ponder and an ask. 

I been working on various things in Detroit for the past few months. Most recently culminating with some scout work for SoCap and helping coordinate a 5 day social innovation institute there. I've done 3 prolonged visits to Detroit and have been beyond delightfully impressed with the caliber of people and their innovative work there. Much of it blows out of the water what various social enterprises in the east and west coast are doing in terms of their work having a legit economic development, job creation, empowering effect for folks there who where devastated by the cities financial collapse. 

The snag for this institute is two fold:

1. Candidates from outside of Detroit who can afford to pay are very apprehensive about coming to Detroit. (this is very interesting observation of those wishing to get in the space and who talks and who walks) 

2. The Detroit folks who are exemplar of what a fellow is can not afford to pay.

Due to the nature of the institute and where it's held it attracts certain folks who are into a more gritty version of social innovation. So looking for those folks to get them to apply. 

Also working on ways to find scholarships for the folks who live there and cant afford to come. One is a crowdfunding option to spread all over and a few other options.  Any tips and observations are welcomed.

"Private sector dynamism versus public sector inefficiency has been a dominant political narrative of the last few decades. It has supplied the excuse for upheaval in many of the public services that we rely on. Yet from healthcare costs to train company subsidies, evidence of private sector superiority is thin. The public sphere in its broadest sense – including voluntary, mutual, cooperative and social enterprise models – can be more efficient and more effective."

Wondering if that story - how the US got into energy efficiency - needs to be told more often. "Is it our current challenge to find new methods of working with networked (rather than linear), distributed (rather than single source) and dynamic (rather than static) knowledge.  What we make in the world is increasingly collaboratively built, perhaps we need to see how knowledge can be collaboratively built also? And how can we ensure that we inject existing wisdom and insight - the kind of deep knowledge currently often held by academics, but perhaps needs to be embedded more deeply into our work and organisations? How do we move on from trust building practices to developing more deliberate, structured, and potentially more powerful ways of knowledge building?"

That's the basic truth, it isn't our fault that our schools are literally built from the ground up to work against us. But, if we are not fighting to change that system every day, from whatever position we hold in education, that is our fault. If we are educators, we begin that profession with a commitment to children, and that is a sacred trust.

The change needed is radical. It is essential that we redefine almost everything about our schools, which is a very difficult task to undertake, but we have a system that is somewhere between 50 and 120 years behind the curve, and that should promote some urgency."

STFU for a minute. We're building a modest first iteration of an online collective intelligence tool to help us figure out how to institute our 10% gender lens bias in due diligence for early stage deals. I hope to institute a gender lens 10% bias to women run enterprises for early stage deals in our next fund. The data says women run enterprise are 15% more likely to be profitable. So I am being conservative and say I will only weigh the gender lens 10 %.

We plan to set up a collective intelligence process using some software we are developing that will let people weigh in on where that 10% should be addressed across four different vectors. Getting better terms from vendors because they understand a more relational view of value exchange, higher margin from customers because they listen better to what their customers want and give them the things they value the most, in employees, retention, quality of workplace, etc. and in the network of partners and ecosystem members they associate with and build value with in a range of partnerships, from evolving past Barney deals; i like you like us, into we plan to do more together in the future, in jv's and other come to market strategies that are shared, and relationships that lead to mergers, acquisitions or sales or partial sales or royalty deals. 

Using that criteria, how do you recognize the relational discount you get from funders, the relational premium you get from customers, the lower training and replacement costs you have among employees, and the overall growth and health of the relevant commons and non financial value your business is creating. Megan from our staff is holding the process in this project until we find someone else. Liz Krueger is overall project manager on the event, and I'm just looping her in. I am looking for a women run group to run with this idea. To be the third party validator for it. It's kinda lame for a big old white straight guy to be the one leading this kind of thing. But I just got tired of people saying how do we use a gender lens? Let's just do it and see what we learn. The numbers says it's a way to reduce risk and increase return. Justice is just a positive externality. This paper show how team work between participants can be facilitated through the use of principles from autopoietic theory and modern WEB2.0 technologies like social networks, forums, semantic wiki systems, podcasting as well as social tagging in order to provide a suitable environment for knowledge management. Argue that leadership is an important factor for autopoiesis  emergence as well as project success. How does Holacracy compare with "building the field" for emergence of collective intelligence and coherence, as described in this beautiful article?  This has always seemed to be the missing piece from what I understand about Holacracy.  cc Brian Robertson

This is an adaptation of an article we wrote for the Aquaponics Survivalist Communities Magazine: "Let’s be our own architects of the future and create a global cooperative for The Highest Good of All. We think that most of us sustainability-minded people know and agree that the technology and resources exist on this planet to feed, house, and supply energy for every man, woman, and child. We think most of us also know and understand that a much more ecologically friendly way of living is possible too.

Working with the Achuar and others, a team of students and faculty (including my brother Oliver Utne) is designing a sustainable transportation system aligned with local cultural values that will protect a biodiverse ecosystem and be an innovative model that can be replicated around the world.

Next Edgers: something kind of incredible happened last night.

In short, I wrote a post on Facebook imagining what it would be like if we treated Watertown residents with the same carelessness that we treat Pakistanis when we hunt down terrorists in their neighborhoods with missiles. 

It went viral overnight. In Pakistan.

If you go to the post now, you'll see that thousands of Pakistanis have shared it, and hundreds are engaging in thoughtful dialogue. (An retired U.S. Navy guy even had a change of heart after talking with them for awhile.)

I'd love it if you joined the conversation. :) For those of us who still feel in the dark after that 1,000+ comment thread: here's Brett Reginald Scott explaining Bitcoin to grandma. Hi.  What's the modern hip way to say 'Clarion call'?  What word(s) would you use if you were trying to create a clarion call? Just got off a nice TNE conversation with Luke Stanley and Lion Kimbro -- the three of us had a number of things in common, all a bit noetic. Sorry the rest of you didn't show up, but a little glad also, since three was just the right number to be unhurried and never interrupt each other. Indy Johar on building the "indie, local, social and open economy":

"This reinvention must go beyond the local co-working office. It must reach every corner and saturate every aspect of the local economy – from the local builder, the garage, corner-shop, bookshop/library, local baker, restaurant , urban farm, school – embracing an indie localism from DIY, food, farming, music, craft, 3-D digital fabrication, robotics, tinkering & remaking. This indie localism cannot be and must not be a rare act performed by a few but a common happening in which just about everyone participates. Unless we rebuild this last mile, we risk structurally split our economy in two pieces – with no way for the next cycle of wealth to transmit thorough the entirety of our socio-economic system." “… somehow his has the good fortune to come last, and when he places his stone the arch stands self supported…. Such individuals had no consciousness of the Idea they were unfolding… but they had an insight into the requirements of the time – what was ripe for development. This was the very Truth for their age, for their world; the species next in order, so to speak, and which was already formed in the womb of time.” (Hegel, Philosophy of History – p. 31 – See Will Durant- The Story of Philosophy – p.297) Happy Earth Day everyone!

http://www.resilience.org/stories/2010-03-05/tyranny-positive-thinking In Honor of Earth Day -The Overview Effect, first described by Frank White, is an experience that transforms astronauts' perspective of the planet and mankind's place on it after viewing Earth from space.

Common features of the experience are a feeling of awe for the planet, a profound understanding of the interconnection of all life, and a renewed sense of responsibility for taking care of the environment.

OVERVIEW is a short film that explores this perspective through interviews with astronauts who have experienced the overview effect. The film also features insights from commentators and thinkers on the wider implications and importance of this understanding for humanity as a whole, and especially its relevance to how we meet the tremendous challenges facing our planet at this time.

I also add qualities to these components, and Ishan is also working on adding quantities. After that, we'll use filters and graph algorithms to selectively reveal patterns.

Liam Black nails it as usual! very well said and excellent advice for the whole of the sector. http://www.pioneerspost.com/news/20130410/letter-young-social-entrepreneur-the-poor-are-not-the-raw-material-your-salvation?goback=.gde_3827697_member_232934613 Thinking about not starting a fight Why aren't more conversations in our community about our community? 
We have (what has the potential to be) one of the most interesting hubs/networks of people on planet earth here, but I don't see that being talked about in a self-reflexive way. I know full well that many of you see this also, I am speaking to you, and others who increasingly see our full potential. 

Many have commented 'we could start a distributed consultancy'. I don't think that we are there. I think we need to create a *stronger*, *more well-formed*, *more well managed*, *more focused and intentional* community of practice. If any online group on Earth has the potential to do this right, isn't it us? 

We have the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience here, the systems and design thinkers, the metacogs, the hackademy... experts (or at least the closest hing to) in every domain that we would need to construct the most well-formed, well managed, daresay collectively intelligent online community of practice to ever exist. 

We have been growing the core trust networks. For many of us, familiar faces appear everywhere online, and our trust networks extend online from everyone that we've met face to face and built trust with to the people that they have met face-to-face and built trust with to the people that we've never met, but assume can not possibly be impostors/faking it because you *just can't fake it* in this community, those who don't contribute meaningfully fail to gain reputation and credibility. I had many powerful experiences of this last year, where I encountered (in-real-life) many many next edgers. I can only imagine from a systems perspective how many other encounters like this took place online and offline, and how much social capital was generated. I believe that in this way above any other, we are sitting on an immense treasure trove. 

Every day here I am seeing conversations between the most incredible, distinct and remote thinkers. Most recently I enjoyed a thread between Dave Pollard and Michel Bauwens. A new era of the Next Edge may be possible, after all, 'the next edge' has been teetering on this edge for quite some time! (If I had to estimate, at least 14 months). 

Chronological linearity, and non-threaded commenting. 
They sound harmless enough, but I believe that *every single day* we are robbed of more beautiful outcomes by *the constraints of our platform*. I propose we mobilize a facebook exodus, a community transplant, and carry this community forward onto greater things! (If you're like me, the next edge is the only thing keeping you on facebook). 

...

'Ok,' says you, 'but where to?'

It seems appropriate that I make at least one proposition, although I still maintain that the most important thing we can establish is not 'how we will do it', but that we have the collective motivation to. I know that if we set our shared intention to something, there is very little we could not do. 

That said, having scouted the waters of Drupal Commons I am mighty impressed, and can hardly think of a more fitting platform for the migration. With all (to my knowledge) the crucial features that facebook offers (likes/upvotes, posts, questions & answers, polls, events (which we don't use collectively here), it quickly exceeds our constraints here with rich-text posts, threaded comments, subgroups, better user and activity following, wikis, the list goes on.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check out HUB OAKLAND, and please please please consider leveraging some of your cash abundance towards stewarding DEEP ABUNDANCE and THRIVING in our community. ~ LOVE & WONDER http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23594261/ Vinay Gupta and I have privately agreed that we'd like to discuss his article here at TNE:

http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/other/we-cant-have-nice-things-because-hakim-bey-and-the-pope-will-molest-your-children-1938

We agreed that we really are after the same thing - drilling down to the truth, even if it's painful. And to do our best not to attack the character of the person making their points.

To me the article boils down to this tenet: radical decentralization has some major weaknesses because "bad people can do bad things" in an unaccountable way without some kind of authority or some kind of "something" to keep it in check. I agree with the something part, but not the "authority" or centralized part. I'm sure Vinay will be able to expound and or clarify this if I've got it wrong.

I don't agree that radical decentralization is something that translates into everyone becoming isolated/Balkanized off in their own little pockets, temporary (or permanent) autonomous zones. But before I explain why, I think it's important to at least see how a mature radically decentralized world might actually work. I did that a couple of months ago in my position piece here:

http://www.radicalabundance.org/innovating-our-way-to-a-peaceful-and-liberating-anarchy/

Please read it before responding, because it forms the bulkwork of my point of view on this issue. Also, even though Vinay's article brings up the serious problem of pedophilia, I think we should stick to the bigger problems of "bad people doing bad things", instead of getting side tracked by pedophilia, which is another, more deeply charged issue. I think the entire debate boils down to what I call the "sociopathology problem of radical decentralization", and my article above addresses that problem head on. The short answer to sociopathology is STIGMERGY. 

Already Vinay, by publishing his article, has raised the alarm bells on Hakim Bey, as well as well as the article on Libcom. The problem however is he has never been charged with a crime, and there is no way to know for certain if these serious allegation are in fact true. And to me that is the greater danger of Radical Decentralization - mob rule. It is my contention that "truth will out" in a sufficiently decentralized, fully disintermediated radical transparency. Please see my essay above for further details.

Vinay, you yourself, at the conclusion of your article, said it better than I could, "Beware the concentration of power in the hands of the few." Indeed! All the more reason for a radical decentralization of power.

Vinay, you're turn. :-) 3D work coming together on the Tropical Atrium thanks to the help of John Bassist. Thank you John!

~ One Community Updates Social Good Ecosystem Incubator

Concept

The Social Good Ecosystem Incubator (SGEI) is a unique and highly innovative incubator model the objective of which is to solve a systemic problem. The absence of funds for very early stage (pre proof of concept) social ventures.

The idea is to think about all of the projects within the incubator as being a part of an ecosystem. In doing so, we can think about allocating resources to the entire ecosystem, not just to one project at a time.

In packaging up projects in this way, we can bring together some projects that are financially viable with others that are not financially viable (maybe don’t even aspire to generate funds). If we are able to identify the right mix of projects, the entire ecosystem becomes financially viable.

What is An Ecosystem?

The idea of an ecosystem offers a great deal more than an opportunity to offer resources (financial and in-kind). It also offers a framework to think about relations between projects that might lead to collaboration opportunities, as well as a way to think about incubation spaces much more holistically.

Extending the Ecosystem: an ecosystem currency

Of course, we can think about the ecosystem as extending beyond the boundaries of the incubator; to the community of people and organizations that it serves. We can think about exchanges of value within this extended ecosystem as being quantified by its own currency, thereby fostering and deepening relationships between organizations within the ecosystem.

The Paradigm Shift

The SGEI concept shifts the playing field in two specific ways:

1. It shifts the funding/resource allocation paradigm away from the enterprise centric model (one project at a time) to a system centric model; one ecosystem at a time! This is consistent with how the world works… think permaculture!
2. It connects two resource allocation models (incubators and early stage funding) and merges them into one concept. Intuitively this makes sense since they are both resource allocation models!

If we can start shifting our thinking away prioritizing one individual… one project which only serves to reinforce the capitalist paradigm of competition versus cooperation, towards a model that thinks about connected systems first, we can completely change the game.

This model, as I will demonstrate, has the ability to unlock large sums of capital and in-kind resources for early stage projects, thereby making it possible to seed the world with more people that are focused on making the world a better place! We continue to simplify our website and clarify our message: Want to transform the planet and significantly impact all of humanity? Here's our 4-phase approach to doing it: http://www.onecommunityranch.org/sustainable-communities-strategy/ 

This is not something we're talking about, it is something we are DOING right now and ANYONE can help create this with us -- or on their own and in a different way using everything we are free-sharing. Help spread these open source ideas!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6LkWrh5zCs&feature=youtube_gdata_player How do you "Share Culture"? II

I have heard that culture is everywhere and everything. I have heard and ethnic student in the college of education explain that, as an American, THEY had no culture.

Economics are cultures. Businesses have cultures, Establishing new economic foundations supporting human transactions and relationships in a "New Economy" is, in part, culture building.

Postmodern culture, even in rebellion, reflects the shared conservative/liberal concern for the individual and anxiety wherever any imaginable choice is made by anyone other than the user. Thus Culture tend to be perceived as moral preserve of  free minds and souls to make for themselves.

But the use of English represents a shared cultural bias as does a largely unspoken minimally codified user agreement largely assumed and lifted from other cultural experiences.

Culture is MOSTLY invisible and its operation by all of the individuals who make up a culture most often proceeds unconsciously. Only when we find ourselves living in a new culture do we understand the current necessity of being mindful of the culture we are embedding ourselves into, and of its myths narratives and rituals.

We are here, in this forum, met as a small part of a greater war against an empire and its culture of oppression. From here we send forth our ideas and creations to serve us in displacing that empire.

I am here as an advocate for culture and to support, in as much as possible, collective mindfulness and intent at this stage and to promote at very least a consideration of accepting a vague, distant, and unobtrusive random noise to inform our proposed universe.

Coming as we do from the empire, focused as it is on establishing and controlling to achieve the requirements of its investors it is all to easy to assume a proposal that comes from an empire of standards and practices and to anticipate a set of requirements to be built and checked off.

I am here to support a disconnect from planners and order and to restore what I understand to have been an autonomous, self-organizing, open-source, cultural model operating on the basis of an open operating system (like linux) that anyone who cares can tinker with but not control or obstruct alternatives.

I use a version of Linus Torvalds' OS (Ubuntu)  not as a programmer by any means but not as a "set it and forget it" passive-user either.  

Likewise, open source systems are not the creation of the masses who use them but a small group of people who care but who also come at the central nproblem from many directions with a variety of solutions to choose from.. not quite is exotic as a wandering taoist or zen monks, but almost.

A sustainable world is served by a sustainable culture; not by a gutted culture designed to support a divide and conquer economic paradigm that sets each individual against the other like crabs in a bucket to assure as little cooperation and mutual engagement as possible. When no one has your back no one can  intervene to stop you from going over the cliff. The empire is only just beginning to sense the flaw here.

Does culture ANY part in nurturing the rebirth of a sustainable world?

"Together, let's discuss:

How are institutions changing? Which are the successful ones?
What's shifting underneath that's causing these changes?
Are new models of leadership emerging? What are they? " Is anyone going to the WSF in Tunis in March, 2013? If so and if you are interested in engaging with Occupy and 15M organizers that are collaborating on the organization of sessions, please let me know. One project that is gaining momentum is the organization of a Camp so that we have shared space to interact and deepen relationships. One can imagine, in addition to the myriad of important sessions that we can partake in, the ability to eat, drink and dance together! Joel Spolsky on "Things You Should Never Do, Part I" http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html
Joel's advice transcends computer code.  What do you think? This is a message for the 2,000 plus who don't post anything here. While there are some sincere people who post, I think what we're mostly seeing here is an ensemble performance by a swarm of persona who are pushing a new world order agenda of global governance, along with lame ideas about influencing transnationals to become do-gooders. Tom Atlee writes, "I found "A Eulogy for #Occupy" profoundly insightful and sensitive, exhibiting a rare integration of journalistic integrity, unflinching critique, and deeply personal vulnerability and compassion.

...

I am posting this to honor the courage of those who do messy hopeful experiments on behalf of the rest of us and the rest of life. We need more experiments like that, and more appreciative critiques to help us learn what to try next..." Of Henry George, John Dewey wrote, “No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker.”

http://wp.me/p2LkON-kv What Hurricane Sandy (and to a lesser extent Katrina), and the idea that these kind of events are the new global normal (Asia has ~80% of pop on coasts), tells us is that the political economy of floods will decide the course of the 21st century. Who loses and wins, in the event and in the aftermath, and how does government contribute to or ameliorate anyone's situation? 
Does anyone know of any work on this? It would be an interesting project to think more about it. Collaboration needs conflict to come up with something new. Use controversy to get over a hump, disruption to spark something unexpected. Perfect for an end-of-year reflection: this important talk by Bret Weinstein with some very fundamental ideas on market feedback loops and collective interest. Didn't get everything? Watch again. How do you "Share Culture"? We all belong to a number of cultures, some we even have a sense of and advocate "for" or "against" ( e,g. I am "more" for indigenous culture and more "against" consumer culture)

As yet I am not seeing any science on how humans MAINTAIN culture.. but I suspect that at the moment we MAY be living through the social collapse of a few contemporary and "modern" cultures.

Looking back, I have begun to notice how my cultures have influenced me and how I have come to feel responsible for nurturing and passing on some of them in better condition than I found them in. For one thing conservatism has become a train-wreck.. not even an on going one just a smoking pile of slag and I regret that deeply and have begun speaking out about the values of traditional conservatism I revere and the values of modern conservatism I believe have crashed the system.

For a long time now I have advocated bonding with the ideas you love most and nurturing preserving restoring and sharing them. Until very recently I had not seen that the kinds of "ideas" I was thinking about were largely part of the category "culture".

This entire "Next Edge" thing is a set of interpenetrating "cultures" all of us value explore and want to advocate for but I am not sure how many of us if any are looking at the challenge from this same perspective or considering how such a perspective has utility or could help us to extend our influence. 

What are your thoughts? How DO you or how COULD you come at this proposed perspective? Anyone here that has some more insights around this subject?

http://rabbitisland.tumblr.com/post/38555747325/1545-pennsylvania Stowe Boyd - important insight for understanding the "postnormal" era.

"Surveys that collect measures of life satisfaction in conjunction with measures of social capital provide evidence that social capital (measured by marriage and family, ties to friends and neighbors, civic engagement, trustworthiness, and trust) is strongly linked to subjective well-being (Helliwell and Putnam 2004). The research so far has largely ignored life satisfaction and social capital in the workplace. Given the fact that workers spend about half of their weekday waking hours on the job, this omission is too important to ignore"

"Recall those ideas when you are reading the prattling of year-end prognosticators: there are some ideas that are timeless, and one is that trust trumps everything else at work, if we only have the eyes to see it.

Very inspiring What does the future of manufacturing look like?  What happens when you build a car using "pair programming" and "agile software dev" principles?

This video: http://vimeo.com/51781311 

In this “OuiShare Talk,” Joe Justice, team leader of Team Wikispeed (wikispeed.com) explains how using Extreme Manufacturing methodology a team of 150+ volunteers around the world managed to build a car in 3 months. This involves pairs of people building stuff (like “pair programming”), object-oriented engineering (everything is replaceable), and agile principles (including a backlog for ‘things to improve team morale’). This car also runs on 100 miles per gallon and is extremely fast. The event was hosted at FabLab Barcelona fablabbcn.org

https://www.torproject.org Making Your Community More Resilient (Hint: It's about people. And connecting. And it's easy.) Edgers, I got a conversation I would like to have here that has been driving me up the wall with frustration from the worlds of social entrepreneurship & impact investing. 

The inane infatuation with scale and the adoration of transnationals their CSR initiatives. The whole line of we should partner with them because they have such vast resources and scale and *POTENTIAL* for good. All sound like the do gooder version of republican rhetoric of "Job creators" and "trickle down" 

I think a basic understanding on economics, systems and sustainability shows that the core model, the DNA, of transnational corporations makes it impossible for them not to be extractive and exploitative. To always sacrifice value creation over profit maximization. Wealth creation for the execs and largest institutional shareholders over legit economic development.   

As Paul Haken says "To maintain the American way of life [and/or the transnational model] we would need 3 more planet earths. 

Also the false duality that only the venture capital, Investment banking or private equity and the transnational model can bring about the changes we are looking for since they are the only one with enough power and scale to do this. 

When a large amount of the reasons why social entrepreneurship needs to exist is the systemic problems that such dense concentration of wealth and power have created and the ecological, cultural and economic disasters it has created.  And the white gloves, cuddling culture of such systems which grants them above the law and immunity from consequences for their actions.  

Why we can not properly prosecute the people who violate the laws and regulations at such a massive scale (Wall st & Mega banks) because they fund both the politicians who write the legislations and decide who gets prosecuted and the do gooder community who comes to their aid citing CSR and all the good that could be done with their vast resources and scale. and they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. 

There is another way to achieve legitimate change on a global scale in a far more powerful, lasting and fundamental way these top down models could ever even dream of. 

Decentralized scale via replication and collaborative networks who work to build strong, autonomous and interdependent local economies. The vast network of small businesses and free lancers is the backbone of the American economy (which is actually what gave rise and continues to fuel the growth and power of these transnationals) is far better suited to achieve the goals and potential of social entrepreneurship and impact investment (please name me 5 VC model impact investments who have had 10x-20x exits) via models like @Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE), Shift Change: Putting Democracy to Work, Evergreen Cooperatives, We the Owners... and many other community economic development and local wealth creation models for strong, sustainable economies that benefit and include, as members of equal importance and co creators of value and wealth, all the inhabitants of a town/city who wish to participate. 

I'm very interested in hearing other sides to this and further expounding of what I've laid out.  Thank you for reading. Cheers! http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2013/01/sacrifice-meaning-and-spontaneous-orders.html Not sure if I should laugh or cry... http://youtu.be/WfGMYdalClU Here's something you might find interesting. I'm curious what folks here think of this.  I see it as a sign of the mainstreaming of the sharing economy. How is that not good news? Of course, there are probably a million ways Avis could f--k it up. This could just as easily be cooptation in order to kill competition (a la the electric car). But Corporate America adopting and scaling sharing business models as fast as possible has got to be part of the picture if we're going to effectively shift to a more sustainable economy and make the already-unfolding impacts of climate change a little less catastrophic. http://bit.ly/Uk1JLr (Martin Montero, feel free to weigh in) Great post today by Chris Corrigan.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v4mbrD802I&list=PLFFD6769A72B7F0DC http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2013/01/i-am-shaman.html David Hodgson posted a link yesterday to this alarming article by Naomi Wolf, asking all of us to read it. I second that request.

Let me say up front that I'm not surprised by the content of the revelations, but I'm quite surprised that they have begun to emerge on the scale of years rather than decades, and I am wary that the emergence may be a feature rather than a bug. As Wolf points out, the revelations constitute a major deterrent to future potential protestors. The same logic, I would argue, applies to the abuses of police power we frequently saw during the protests. The article is here:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy

Liz McLelln asked a very important question in response to David's post, and I want to focus attention on it, because I think it is a very large elephant, in a fairly small room. The question was, if you didn't participate in Occupy, what will you do now that you understand the immense jeopardy still faced by those that did?
 
The vast majority of Americans did not Join OWS. The reasons varied widely, and many were, of course, legitimate. It is also important to acknowledge the fact that Occupation movements around the country did not play an intelligent game with respect to bringing a wide range of people on board--a hazard of leaderlessness, perhaps. 

But that's water under the bridge. Now we find ourselves in a very different landscape. The curtain has been pulled back by surprising year's end emergence of documents whose existence had been long been denied by the FBI in response to prior FOIA requests. The most surprising revelation in this release is that DHS/local police/the FBI/and private financial interests had (and presumably still have) a disturbingly direct, explicit and bi-directional relationship, the implications of which would be well worth unpacking, though I won't do it here. Even more frightening is the fact that the within this unholy alliance, a secret claim was presumed to be self evident--that occupy was in some way connected to terrorism. That connection renders our now literal emperor, metaphorically naked. 

Does this sound hyperbolic? Read on. 

Last December 31st, The President signed the NDAA in Hawaii (with the entire world ahead and therefore distracted by new years celebrations) which granted  him the 'right' (legally active as of last March) to have any human removed from any location, anywhere in the world, and to 'detain' that person 'Indefinitely' with zero right of the detained person to judicial oversight or review, zero right to know the charge, zero right to even have the basic authority evaluated on constitutional grounds. Only one condition need be met to trigger the draconian provision: "material support" by a person of any group engaged in "terrorism." 

Lest we derive any comfort from the fact that there is *some* threshold that must be crossed by an individual before they are extraordinarily rendered, consider the fact that the executive also gets to secretly define the terms "material", "support", and "terrorism", each absurdly vague in their own right. 

How long could detention last? According to the new law, until "the end of hostilities", which presumably means some moment when terrorism is no longer a risk. Even "indefinite" fails to capture the punitive power at the president's discretion.

Not only is this the language surrounding these powers pure Newspeak, It is also check and mate against all traditional approaches to change. Protest and protestors are no longer protected. Even torture is presumably on the table. And if I might sharpen the point a bit, what rights does a person actually retain if they can be hauled away, forever, on the sole authority of the executive who is entirely free to secretly define all the terms? The third amendment, might endure? But every other right is effectively demoted to the status of a privilege, revokable at will by an uncheckable and unbalanced secret authority. 

So back to Liz's question. If you woke up one day and discovered that 1) a totalitarian state had cryptically replaced the American constitutional democracy with tyranny, and 2) the fact of this transition was, to the extent it was being covered at all, only being substantially addressed by off-shore news agencies, and 3) the totalitarian state had secretly targeted people engaged in reasoned, peaceful assembly and protest with a label it engineered to allow problem persons to be permanently disappeared... what would you do? With warmest wishes to everyone here, and with gratitude for the exploring and creative environment that is this group. The machine appeared
In the distance, singing to itself
Of money. Its song was the web
They were caught in, men and women
Together. The villages were as flies
To be sucked empty.
God secreted
A tear. Enough, enough,
He commanded, but the machine
Looked at him and went on singing.

-- R S Thomas Happy new year!  Some inspirational thoughts from TED, PopTech, and a New Year's Resolution:

www.ted.com/talks/israel_and_iran_a_love_story.html
When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent, Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message: "Iranians ... we [heart] you." Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and Iranians responded in kind. The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like "Israel loves Iran," "Iran loves Israel" and even "Palestine loves Israel."  Ronny Edry of Israel accidentally created an online movement for peace in the Middle East when he posted a Facebook image that declared "Iranians, we will never bomb your country."

PopTech talk by David DeSteno
www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/10/22/david-desteno-compassion-resilience-poptech/
People who focus on the similarities between themselves and others – even those who cheat (in the laboratory) – act with more compassion.  This was measured by the amount of hot sauce given to another participant in a “taste test”.

The active practice of compassion can take a lifetime to master, in many hours and years of meditation practice.  But what’s happily surprising is that the “shortcut” from psychology research is that focusing on similarities means that you can get to a similar result.  

So that’s my New Year’s Resolution.  To actively re-focus my attention on the similarities between myself and others, when I’m frustrated, indifferent, or just going about my day to day life.  Changing the world outside oneself starts with a perspective shift in consciousness.  And as Pema Chodron says, “Start where you are.” via Dante-Gabryell Monson

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy

Revealed: how the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occupy
New documents prove what was once dismissed as paranoid fantasy: totally integrated corporate-state repression of dissent
It was more sophisticated than we had imagined: new documents show that the violent crackdown on Occupy last fall – so mystifying at the time – was not just coordinated at the level of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and local police. The crackdown, which involved, as you may recall, violent arrests, group disruption, canister missiles to the skulls of protesters, people held in handcuffs so tight they were injured, people held in bondage till they were forced to wet or soil themselves –was coordinated with the big banks themselves. Of the few remaining forests on the Planet, 70% soon will be dead from drought, releasing carbon instead of absorbing it....

And so, my friends we come to another cycle – one year ends and another begins. Throughout the past year, we’ve had good times and hard times. Trying times, and triumphant times. Happiness, joy, sadness and pain. 
But as we look back, we recognize that ALL of it has been a blessing. Through every one of these experiences, we learn. And as we learn, we grow. And through it all, we are transformed, ever so slightly by each experience. We may not see the day-to-day growth and transformation, but as we walk upon the path of our Sacred Journey, we can look back and see how far we have come in the past year! My friends, you have grown by leaps and bounds! Your understanding of Love and it’s importance is stronger than ever before! In the past year you have learned things that you never thought possible. At the same time, you have also become the blessing that teaches others so that they would learn and grow – just as you did! 
And as the dawn of the new year approaches, we will surely face more challenges, but more opportunities. More trying times, but more triumphant times! There will be sadness, but there will be happiness! Above it all, remember that your happiness depends on your own perception of the world around you! Do your absolute best to see with clarity, that the trying times are meant to be, and will help us grow! Give thanks for ALL of your blessings, every day! And every day, be that blessing that someone is grateful for! Take advantage of the opportunities that come your way – for they are meant ONLY for you! And remember to seize the moment, for the moment is all we are promised! 
As always, BE love and BE peace and BE compassion – every moment of every day! Be the catalyst that brings in the energies of Peace and Love into our Earth – and beyond! Be the beings of Light and Love that you are! Be the change that this world needs.

Focus on 2013 half a career later re-ignites insight.

"A leader simply operates at their best when they understand their ability to influence is much more fruitful than their ability to control. Here’s the thing – the purpose of leadership is not to shine the spotlight on yourself, but to unlock the potential of others so they can in turn shine the spotlight on countless more. Control is about power – not leadership."

This is a good time of year to just fucking look in the mirror for a second and be grateful for all you have, for all the horros you have been spared. In the city here this time of year people die all the time.. People who don't even show up on the news.. the nameless, the speechless.. So please look in the mirror and ask yourself, "Am I so fucking righteous after all? Am I as righteous as I think I am? I mean really?" All this "social business" and this "charity".. when really most of it is pure bullshit.. The fight against corruption starts at home.. It's your neighbors who are corrupt, it's not these "untouchables" somewhere in some special place... the bad people are in your homes at Christmas.. you just haven't realized who the bad people are.. Come on, let's look at the facts, let's be honest.. Take child abuse, and yeah I'm talking sexual abuse.. It's never this "monster" somewhere in some scary house across town.. It is ALWAYS someone you know.. a brother or a cousin or nephew or uncle or neighbor or what have you.. There is NO boogie man! The real boogie man lives in your neighborhood.. What are you going to do about the boogie man? You want to excise him in some surgical operation, in some military operation? No.. What do you think the evil man wants? He wants what we all want, he wants to be loved, esteemed, appreciated.. But he wasn't..and he feels pain, he is sad inside.. And then years down the road, he does unmentionable things... But he was sitting right there at your motherf*cking Christmas party and you did NOTHING! I'm serious.. We wait until someone does something abominable before taking action, before "caring".... Look around you, can you name 1 to 5 people who are "off the rocker"? You sure can.. you know someone who is suffering who is acting weird or who whatever.. someone you asked yourself about, "I wonder about Mr. X." Well you "wondered" but you did nothing.. You should have invited him for supper.. and showed him a good time, and got to know him.. asked him what his thoughts and feelings were about the world.. You will save lives doing this... more to come, more to come... I'm just a lunatic, don't mind me.. It's just the winter reminds me of all the friends I lost to the cold Canadian winters.. People think all we do is ski here.. but no, we have people dying in the streets because they have no homes and they aren't allowed to go anywhere to warm up.. Restaurants? No, they are "monsters" they can't go in your restaurant to warm up... Grocery store? No, they are "thieves" they scare away the customers... So what's left? They can't stay in parks, that's illegal now.. So they fucking walk around until they die of hypothermia.. I've seen it happen before my eyes, someone collapse in front of me.. you can call 911 all you want, ask soon as they ask you what's going on and realize it's just a junky or a homeless person...they don't care... someone will find the body and clean it up in the morning, it's not an "emergency"... you know? A cadaver is not an emergency... like a dead bird or dead squirrel on the street.. not a very big "catastrophe"... If you want to help the less fortunate, go find someone nearby who has already been doing that for decades in the community.. because they alone will know what needs to be done... it's not just a money thing.. I've seen homeless people win large sums of money in the lottery.. it didn't help them... Funny enough, when you give the less fortunate access to relatively large sums of money, what do you think they do with it? They share it with their family and friends.. like anyone else... they get abused and lose most of it.. trying to help others.. the last person they think of helping is themselves.. in some cases... Anyway please the next person who asks you for spare change on the street... give them $10-$20 dollars... give them a freaking $20 dollar bill.. and tell them I don't care who you are or what you're going to do with the money, I just know that I'm lucky to be much better off than you are.. so God bless you take the money and enjoy it as much as you can... What are you going to do with the money that's so great anyway? Your credit card bills are 10 times that.. "Free trade" has a lot of linguistic baggage. What's good about all the various meanings and what's bad?

This is our challenge, to scale intelligence to higher levels, and we in this community I believe do stand a chance, but I see failures in this community (I see failure as a positive thing, we are failing better than most). I, personally, would love to see this group get less about sharing links (and contributing to the information overload we suffer from on the rest of the Internet), and see more people practicing the art of hosting, and communicating with more presence here.

http://nuet.us/2012/12/26/emergent-humanity-is-planetary-in-scope/ saw les miserables last night. reminded me so much of the arab spring, of occupy, of resistance and passion as well as seeming futility and hopelessness. of how much of the world has been built on the energy of slaves/the 99%. 

this song from les miserables was sung at the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. powerful stuff.

This is NOT a Simulation:

The Divide, Conquer, Confuse, Repeat algorithm against humanity continues in full force, this time with gun control as the latest vehicle. As a response to the 'incident' in Newton, the masses are yet again digging in to their respective sides (only two in such a complex issue?), hyperventilating, demanding, castigating, demonizing, even issuing the equivalent of fatwas against the 'others' in a state of what I call "issue ecstasy," the state where all foregone logic temporarily or permanently...leaves the body, and the actions and rhetoric of the soul are literally surrendered robotically to a different force.
Pause to think about that please. If true, or even partially true, this theory alone could justify significant research in the domains of media, politics, liberties, personal choice and self-determination, mythology, spirituality, even exo-politics.
But back down to earth, the raging, manufactured, whipped up fight on "gun control" rages on through virtually all media channels without the slightest possibility of middle ground because "peace," my dear readers is decidedly not the real goal in the DCCR equation.
And please understand, there is nothing organic, personal, self-guided or rational about this battle as it has all been fully and completely gamed out at think tanks and foundations in DC, Moscow, and as only recently proved, Beijing (see RT). "Mind and policy manipulation tanks" may be a better, more apt description going forward. The current discourse is expressly designed to cause destruction, battle and do so in a way, and here's the sinister part, that even if you win you lose...
So let's game this out ourselves in the spirit of intellectual honesty and critical thinking. Option A) if the State achieves operational, mission objectives of full citizen disarmament, then the citizens are left completely defenseless against abuse, seizure, detention, injury and increasingly likely death. No college degree, false sense of rights nor ownership will stand in their way. This is being made brutally clear, not just in some ways, but in ALL ways of our current existence, in both 'legal' policy and action.
Option B) if the NRA and even non-affiliated "I think it just may be wise to remain armed" citizens prevail and keep their guns, you will merely be broadcasting yourself to be a combatant against the State. And here's where...the intellectual dishonesty and manipulation starts to crackle. Even if you WIN and are able, for a period of time to maintain a pistol, a couple rifles, even a semi-aut weapon, do you think for even a fraction of a moment you're somehow safe?
In that moment, that fight or flight human moment, when your instincts to protect yourself, your family start to kick in and you unlock the gun case, hand a gun to your wife, to your son, your daughter...what match will you possibly be to a fully militarized police force that will be rolling down your street in fortified tanks, SWAT teams, untrained but now-deploed TSA forces, and actual domestic and foreign military troops in full impenetrable battle gear, helmets, with fully automatic weaponry, rocket grenade launchers, and likely, weapons that we don't even know exist. Even if your entire block is of like mind and preparedness, for that matter, your entire town or city, what will be your chances of survival? Actual...survival.
All this is to suggest...we are yet again being deliberately spun around on a topic that is in theory and practice meaningless, and they know it. In fact, they're laughing at you right now. All of you, all of us, on both 'sides.'
I will not prescribe specific answers in this article, but a few general concepts do come to mind. First, remove yourself and your precious energies from the game being played against you. Second, organize...differently, unconventionally. Third, consider other tools...entirely. And forth and lastly, humanity, history, and the well being of our species...is on our side.

IndieGoGo.com/FracturedLand i wonder if there's really a way to design for breakthrough innovation We are building an enterprise grade distributed cloud file system and have been looking into producing an open community version.

This would function much like dropbox only the user would have their data encrypted on their devices to ensure security and privacy - and never be left in the hands of 3rd parties (including us). 

The idea is to build something that has no single point of failure or attack. The intention is to create a secure and open platform that can support the emergence and adoption of disruptive technologies, particularly in the areas of social enterprise and finance.

Is this something that would be of interest to you personally? Do you know of anyone else doing this? If so, what are their limitations or barriers to adoption? The challenge I'm facing is that many of our advisors believe this could be a drain on energy and limited resources (given our startup status) and advise against it. At the same time it's something that I'm passionate about seeing in the world. 

I'd like to gauge how much interest there is and whether anyone has suggestions for creating a viable community version business model that can at least allow it to be self-sustaining. Also, if you are interested in trying it out, please leave your email in the link below to register for the beta when it becomes available early next year. Thanks. wonderful project:

House Republicans: Copyright Law Destroys Markets; It's Time For Real Reform

from the congress-wakes-up dept

Update: Wow. It took less than 24 hours for the RSC to fold to Hollywood pressure. They have now retracted the report and attempted to claim that it was not properly vetted.

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121116/16481921080/house-republicans-copyright-law-destroys-markets-its-time-real-reform.shtml We should all consider contributing in a form or another, including content, as the P2P Foundation is key to the development of our activities!

The Foundation has launched a fundraising campaign to expand its activities in 2013.

The p2p foundation aggregates data and conversations on emerging distributed and alternative practices into viable theories and models that in turn reinforce and amplify new practices and action. The Orange report on the Collaborative Economy is an illustration of this outstanding work. The P2P Foundation itself is a commons that needs to grow and continue operating as a midwife of a new economic model mindful of the commons in its widest definition.

I am honored to contribute time and financial support to the Foundation and to be part of the P2P Cooperative! this is dynamite:

My dear friend Tea Faerie, has this to say:

"I'm getting super excited about the future...for a lot of reasons, but the following reason is a particularly good one.. so I want you to pay special attention to what I am about to say, because I think it's a really, really, really BIG deal. It's starting to become exquisitely clear that old school hierarchical power structures are simply no match for large, creative, and sustained resistance networks. It's an evolutionary thing. It's the next step in human organization.

"Because networks are better adapted than their predecessors were. The upshot of this is that the balance of power has been acutely tipped in the people's favor. And I mean ACUTELY tipped. Our powers have been increased by like an order of magnitude. It's huge, it's decisive. It's the whole next level of the big scale. Just like Cro-Magnon man kicked the asses of the Neanderthals. Homo "Nexus" will kick the collective asses of entrenched, broken, top-heavy, corrupt, outdated, dysfunctional, dominator style power structures that are wreaking havoc on this beautiful planet. I think a lot of that stuff is going to break down now. The tired old techniques that have traditionally been employed to organize and oppress thousands, even millions of relatively isolated and powerless individuals aren't going to work any more. What's better (or worse for them) is that governments of the world are deeply entrenched, calcified systems that don't know how to adapt very quickly. They are made to be hard to change on purpose, whereas a network is constantly changing, adapting and improving itself on a very quick feedback cycle, because a network has so many more points in which innovation can spring. A network is hypernomadic. That's another word I got from Mark Pesce. What that means is that a successful behavioral pattern quickly spreads throughout a network."

Indeed, how can hierarchical power structures possibly keep up? A Reflection on the Mayan Calendar coming to an end...

Pull together your company’s latest annual report, its mission statement, and your CEOs last few blog posts. Read through these documents and note the key phrases. Make a list of oft-repeated words. Now do a little content analysis. What are the goals and ideas that get a lot of airtime in your company? It’s probably notions like superiority, advantage, leadership, differentiation, value, focus, discipline, accountability, and efficiency. Nothing wrong with this, but do these goals quicken your pulse? Do they speak to your heart? Are they “good” in any cosmic sense?

Now think about Michelangelo, Galileo, Jefferson, Gandhi, William Wilberforce. Martin Luther King and Mother Theresa. What were the ideals that inspired these individuals to acts of greatness? Was it anything on your list of commercial values? Probably not.

We're at $666 dollars on the indiegogo campaign! Help! ;) http://indiegogo.com/hugtrainusa Joe and myself interviewed by Rachel Nuwer at NYTimes about our ClimateMeme project at darwinSF http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=530570420287084 Imagine if just a few of these items were true?  Are there power elites?  If true, is it not possible they could affect the outcome?  Just something to think... tread lightly & realize "you wander in a kingdom that is not your own, yet you believe it's your dominion to shine" (whether it be FB or your nation - potentially). Not sure if this has already been shared here. But this is a really important frame shift, one that folks like Sanjay Khanna, Johan Rockström and (my wife) Cilla Utne have been talking about for years. Glad to see Superstorm Sandy focusing some attention to it. Dear friends,

As you may know, we are doing a fundraising campaign to have some operational funding for 2013.

We are looking from 'endorsements', i.e. short quotes of support, that we can use in this campaign. Thanks for considering it!

In this second installment, David proposes a U.S. Chamber of the Commons as an enabling institution for such Assurance Commons to emerge:

Here is my TEDx Bellevue talk that gives the context. My TEDx Bellevue talk(video) on Entrepreneurship. Societies throughout history and organizations of all kinds are kept vital and creative by having individuals step up to playing archetypal roles that ensures society avoids decay and instead thrives. Hear how business icons like Steve Jobs and Oprah as well as everyday business people are taking on roles that can make a difference on a grand scale by using a business platform to foster change. And how you can as well!

Thank you! <3 How does each of us, each of our initiatives grow the Commons? 

What could happen with a new paradigm based on growing the commons? Just like these past decades concentrated on growing GDP and profit? I'm pretty sure much of the initiatives around sustainability, thrivability, social innovation, resilience could be expressed in terms of growing or nurturing a piece of the commons. 

So let's collect and share stories of how various unconnected activities actually grow the commons as a whole. Let's illustrate how the commons -in its widest definition- manifest in various shapes, tones, flavors... and could contribute to organically and 'invisibly' converge and coalesce many disparate efforts... The attractor...

They’re seething with anger at the utterly corrupt system and a kleptocratic government that have done so much damage to the country; and they’re furious at the international bailout politics whose money only benefits big banks, not the people.

These men take their anger to their families, and their sons take that anger to the street. Hence the growing number of violent gangs that attack minorities. The will to survive in humans is enormous, Pieper points out, and so humans are able to overcome even incredibly difficult situations. To do that, they need a functioning society with real structures and safety nets. But in Greece, society has been hollowed out for years to the point where it is collapsing." I am doing something I don't normally do - asking people to please share this post. If you agree, please share not only on FB but also in Google and at your own blogs or via email. Thank you all for who you are. I’ve been looking into Do-It-Ourselves approaches to wellness and health care savings. Here’s a scenario that may work for members of online communities.  Appreciate any ideas to improve it.

Safeway has gained attention for a new kind of wellness-oriented group insurance policy that lowers health care costs: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124476804026308603.html . 

Employees who lower their body mass index (for example) below 30 now qualify for hundreds of dollars in insurance cost savings each year.

Although Safeway now offers this kind of insurance only to those who work for Safeway, a simple policy reform can change this – and reward pro-health behavior among customers as well.

At the state level, laws are keeping Safeway, Whole Foods, and other food/nutrition providers from offering their customers an opportunity to shop for health insurance and HMOs on a group basis.

If policy reforms were to lift such barriers, customers who joined collaborative purchasing pools could be rewarded for taking steps to reduce their health risks.

Groups of customers – or members of online communities such as Next Edge – might opt into pledges to hit targets of weight, exercise, and body mass index.

With friends, neighbors, and/or subgroups in online communities, they might set desired goals such as going on long walks three times a week, bringing BMI to under 30, shedding 10 pounds, eating whole grains, doing an hour a week of appreciative listening, and/or any other mutually agreed health-enhancing practice.

Online updates could be a condition of staying part of such peer health groups. Depending on the agreed kind of new health practices, cell phone pix could be uploaded of grocery receipts (confirming purchases of healthier foods), daily weigh-ins, post-workout photos, etc.

The progress updates could be shared either in private or in open Facebook groups and G+ communities.

After a period of digitally tracked adherence, members could invite grocery chains offering lifestyle-sensitive group health policies to bid for the group’s business, perhaps offering discounts on food purchases as well as health insurance/health care. The bidders would then compete, likely with occasional spot-check or other provisions to confirm ongoing adherence by members with continued healthy eating and exercise routines.

Such a “reverse Groupon” approach for group health insurance and care provision would improve health outcomes and yield immense insurance and care savings.

For those who desired to reap further savings, some self-organizing insurance groups might express to insurors a willingness to have major non-emergency operations/procedures done in (insuror-approved) clinics overseas.

Combining this option with P2P-driven, verifiable lifestyle changes would give individuals the ability to radical lower their health care costs – and remain alive and well as customers of grocery and other chains for (much) longer.

I have a small holiday wish, that I'm hoping you might help fulfill.  A close friend of mine, Trevor Hubbard, has just found out that he is unable to keep dog and best friend Jackson.  I was wondering if any of you may know of any body or any organization that is looking for a wonderful, friendly, fully grown Viszla that still has the playfulness of a puppy, and a personality that makes most people look shallow :)

We're hoping to find a place that is a little off-grid, with no close quarters, no kids, and has lots of open space like a ranch or homestead.

If you know of anyone or any organization, please send me a message, and I'll connect you with Trevor, and send you more information. Thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer, and warm wishes for the holidays.

Cheers,

Andrew Agree or disagree? Hi folks!  

My friend Danielle Lanyard, an expert in the "Green Movement", is scaling her startup, Green Breakfast Club, and needs your help. She's looking for support for their expansion to London and Nairobi, and to find a lead organizer for the Green Breakfast Club events in New York City.  

About Green Breakfast Club:
Green Breakfast Club is a peer to peer resource exchange that meets for monthly networking events to grow local green business community through resource sharing. The event format includes a TEDx-style keynote speaker’s success and failure story & a one hour resource exchange where each attendee presents short ‘gives’ and ‘asks’ to share resources. This event meshes innovators in social and green enterprise, technology, nonprofit, startup, the financial sector and Corporate Social Responsibility.

From Danielle:
"Green Breakfast Club is expanding to London, Nairobi, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Copenhagen. We launched by bootstrapping in NYC in June of 2011 and piloted for 1 year, aimed to get people to share resources, to help them accelerate their ventures, and to help all grow their local green business community." All this time, I've been trying to develop a unique technology to enable members to share resources with eachother, and for each city and its members to connect, hence London and Nairobi being the first 2 choices. London we are at Google Campus, Nairobi at iHub. Copenhagen at the Hub.

New York is where it all began, and now Foundation Center is the anchor partner for all 2013 events. The speaker lineup for 2013 is incredible: Andrew Winston on January 11th, Tonya Surman on February 8th, Shane McQuaid of Voltaic Systems on March 8th, Dan Apfel of Responsible Endowments Coalition on April 12th, and many more soon to be announced.  As Danielle expands the concepts globally and travels around the world like a Johnny Appleseed spreading green entrepreneurship, she needs one incredible individual to run the GBC NYC events.  As so much has already been taken care of with their partner venue, speaker roster booked, and strong alliance of partners and sponsors, this is an incredible opportunity for the right person to volunteer to be present at these events and work with the growing Green Breakfast Club as they help ally community and build capacity in the Green Entrepreneurship Ecosystem.  Past volunteers have gone on to secure incredible jobs, launch their own green events, and get connected the most foremost leaders in the Green Entrepreneurship and Impact Investing space.

Right on Joshua!!! Hey Fed Heads, if you're starting a humanitarian tech project and want some mentorship and support, Geeks Without Borders has a mentorship program, and you should apply!

The Geeks Without Bounds Accelerator program is currently accepting applications from humanitarian projects that need time and mentorship to go beyond the realm of a weekend hackathon project. The deadline is fast approaching, so gather your information and fill out the application by December 15th!

The GWOB accelerator gives you access to mentors who will explain the steps for you to bring your humanitarian hack from weekend project to full product over a six month period. Get field experience and connect with existing organizations right from the very start. In the second and third month you’ll get support to help with development, ensure that your project is as secure as possible, and guidance in the area of human rights as it relates to your project. In the third and fourth months you work with mentors on business development, forming a legal container for your project and refining your pitch so that you can meet with investors or appropriate partners in the fifth month. At the six month point, your project is graduated out into the world as a product, an organization, or a team within an existing organization.

Before I wind up for the night, I wanted to share the answer to my question yesterday about muting posts.

It came from Seb Paquet, who wrote:

"My own strategy has been to block a choice few people. Just visit their personal page and hit Block. Then you won't see the posts they write, nor their comments. They won't see your threads either. This has worked wonderfully well for me until recently, when the feature seemed to have begun working erratically. Your mileage may vary."

His tip worked. So if you can't see this post, please don't be offended. I've blocked you because your contributions aren't working for me, and aren't what I came here for. Perhaps they work for others.

I will not get into the habit of blocking people willy-nilly. I'm actually quite patient, and I value the debate here too much to stifle my own participation by blocking out people. But, you know...

A phenomenon that is to be noted and seriously taken: The HEAT that is "thrown off" into the atmosphere when Autos/Aircrafts burn fuels. The average heat available in every Kg of Petroleum fuels are the equivalent of 13.5 Electrical units (KWH). The real energy that is available for "motion" etc are not more than 4.5 KWH equivalent. Thus, where does the balance 9 KWH energy go? This is the heat that is "thrown off" into the atmosphere! Now one can compute how much Heat is spewed into the atmosphere by every nation on earth.

I would recommend that everyone join the G+ group to see what it looks like. The wacko Viscount Monckton has assembled quite a rogues gallery of climate change deniers and is apparently getting this editorial-disguised-as-an-open-letter published in quite a few right-wing mainstream newspapers. I don't think there's any need to refute its absurd claims. I just wonder what goes on in the heads of people like this that they have this need to believe this? What is wrong with these people?

Moleque de Ideias (as also others firms like Curto Café) is built around the idea that every(at least, most of) the productive activities could be executed in an open, diversified, trust-based environment, small.

    Open in the sense that since its beginning as a software engineering company the environment was open to children explore their own ideas, choices. To do what they chose to do. And since 3 years ago, I think by the general transformation of the one-hierarchical world to the fractal-distributed-worlds, lots of friends and friend of friends meet here to explore ideas, drink coffee, eat bread :-) , little talk, create, work.
    Diversified in the sense that there is no privileged theme, technology or subject that is prohibited or "focused". Ideas must born and die as organisms; if someone has an idea, go forward. During these 17 years I really can't say what "we' do: we do what people that lives-works wants to do. Some ideas-projects generates flow of money; others generate flow of material; others generate "I don't know what they generate and I really don't care".
    Trust-based because it's all that matters after all, before all, between all. Building friendship is not only "way" or "the end"; is "the end and the way". And as peace, democracy, etc there is no pathway to friendship besides exerting friendship.
    Small is almost a logical necessity. I won't advance the whys and because here but in a simple phrase: "largeness" and "uniformity" leads inevitably to the establishment of "closed doors', "no-colaboration", "hierarchical phenomena" and inefficiency.

So: no separation of work, learn, create, play. This artificial separation of environment of learn(schools in their most diversified forms but always schools-reproduction of someone(s) past ); work and play is a phenomena intrinsic of a hierarchical and outside-regulated world. This separation hardly emerges in a distributed way of living. (for me "live" embraces "create" that embraces "work-share-learn" that embraces "live" again).

I (for)see that social organisms like Moleque de Ideias and Curto Café, when-where people(no age, no professional specialization segregation) produce-share-learn (a longer and triple word for a simpler-shorter one: "live") will be very common in the future."

http://p2pfoundation.net/Moleque_de_Ideias For Deleuze, social innovation takes place through windows of opportunity for social creativity (ie. along lines of flight) which emerge as challenges to institutional legitimacy. Innovation often emerges from conflict. Opportunity spaces often are at micro-levels which make possible creative strategies at macro-levels. Great post on UnSectored today: www.unsectored.net/problem-with-american-activist/ 

"A Canadian activist once told me, “When American activists see a problem or injustice, they immediately say, ‘What shall we do? What shall we do?’ 

And they run around doing a lot, but much of it is ineffective, because they don’t stop to say, 

‘What do I think about this? What do others think? Are my feelings and my thoughts different? Am I acting out of what I have been taught to think, or have I taken the time to create my own thinking? Whom can I talk with?’”
--Kim Klein, “Talking About Taxes,” 09/22/2010

Here's to co-creating lasting change! Earlier today, Google finally added group functionality to G+! I've taken the liberty of creating the G+ Next Edge community/group. Google won't let me add my 300+ person circle of next edgers, so we'll just have to grow organically as is our custom.

These G+ Communities work a little different from Facebook Groups.. most notably, people can't be automatically be added to the them. (Yay!) So, if I have it set up right, you should be able to submit a join request and a moderator should be able to add you in short order! Let me know if you have any issues and I'll see what's up. Some associates and I are seriously considering launching a new project titled "Reform Wall Street." Following is a summary of our current thinking:

    Mission: Help make all banks serve the real economy.

    Goals:
    1.    Discourage risky, nonproductive financial transactions in the paper economy.
    2.    Break up banks that are too-big-to-fail.
    3.    Reestablish the wall between commercial and investment banking.
    4.    Eliminate governmental subsidies for Big Banks that make it harder for community banks to compete.
    5.    Promote government-owned public banks such as the Bank of North Dakota.

    Methods:
    1.    Develop an informal network of individuals concerned about this issue.
    2.    Share information, analysis, and action alerts.
    3.    Support the development of inclusive, member-controlled grassroots activist organizations dedicated to this cause.
    4.    Promote the growth of a more just, compassionate, and sustainable society.
    5.    Encourage the development of small, supportive communities whose members support one another in their personal development, community building, and civic engagement.

I would appreciate your feedback on the above summary, including suggested modifications and ideas concerning how we might collaborate with others.

Take care,

http://youtu.be/HpI-LIXOCwk Hi! I'm working with a few Next Edgers to prototype a micro-consulting service that would help Main Streamers connect with Edgy people and ideas. We're looking for a few practice clients, pro bono, to help us with some practice runs.

Here are some examples of what people we would work with might be looking for:
“I have a great idea but I'm not sure how to get to proof of concept”
“I have a great idea but not a lot of people to talk to who grok it, is it viable?”
“I’m trying to sell my boss on an innovative idea, how can I do that?”
“What are some next steps I can take towards resilience?”
“How do I build a collaboration network of like-minded people?”
“How can I shift my projects to using more open source technologies?”

A session would consist of a 30 min consultation with a team of 3-4 new economy practitioners customized to answer the issues of the client. This would most likely be a skype meeting. We would provide a follow up list of resources and would ask that the pro bono client fill out a short survey to help us better and refine our services. 

If you know someone who might be interested, message me or leave me an email below and I'll contact. Thanks! Tremendous article here profiling an effort in Washington DC to beta-test the crowdsourcing of local, urban infill developments... "The history of modern financial investment has been the story of people and their money moving farther apart into abstraction, to the point where most of us don't know where our investments (if we have any) have gone. But shorten the distance between those two points, and things start to change. Put your money into a building you can see in your neighborhood, and suddenly you might care more about the quality of the tenant, or the energy efficiency of the design, or the aesthetics of the architecture."

http://www.chaoticripple.com/2012/what-happens-when-we-shock-a-system/ join us human rights education .anti corruption What is the most effective role of data in planning? (MOST effective often goes counter to what we've been taught...) Thinking about Egypt, where Arab Spring is being ignited again in protest of attempts by the current Islamist president to aggregate and centralize power in his hands. Hearts, eyes and ears of youth across the Arab World are now on Cairo. T
he religious ones are in shock because Mursi was able to stand up against the Military power and that was people’s main nightmare early this year. He also takes much credit for facilitating a ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Secular/agnostic/atheist young Arabs are saying, over social media, we told you so..

Here is a song in two youtube clips that I like to share with you. The title is “The Circus”. In one clip it is recited by a poet . In the other, it is sung by a guitarist. The lyrics very much speak for what is happening now, criticizing the authority of Islamists, military, and parliament. More importantly it speaks for group creativity and emergence that defined the leaderless Arab Spring in Egypt last year. It is so uplifting to know that this song was improvised, both as a poem and as a song, on stage: i.e. in a tent in Tahrir square on 11 July 2011 jointly by Galal and Rami. These clips were captured right there and then. I have come to meet and listen to both Galal and Rami during a visit to Cairo early this year. Galal and Rami ran into each other for the first time at Tahrir Square

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=iHHdB_v-WL0 Thinking of Oman, my favorite destination for diving, meditation and reflection. I have also promised Dlight Sky photos I took at the ancient port of Samhuram. So here are two pictures from Samhuram.. I also found words I have written then
in my diary that I like to share...

These are a few pictures from my ongoing writing
retreat in Salala on the shores of the sea of Arabs in
the South of Oman. It is said that Queen of Sheba came
here to obtain supplies of frankincense. I include a
picture of MOSCHA OR Samhuram, a 400 B.C ancient port
for exporting frankincense which is located close to
Salala. I also include a picture of a language that
Arabs communicated with at that ancient port (carved
on stone).

Everything touches everything in our interrelated
world as Borges once said.. thus it is no surprise
that excavations for the port of Samhuram in Oman were
motivated by a drawing of a ship in a temple in the
Valley of the Kings in Luxor-Egypt.. Learning should
help open people's eyes to see all sort of connections
and to act on such perception. Education the way we
know it today is yet to evolve more and more in that
direction.

BTW, people in Southern Oman still add frankincense to
water for health reasons. It is supposedly good for
many things like stomach ache.

I am yet to go shop for some frankincense to taste
with water. I was advised at the hotel to ask for
"Thakar" frankincense when I go to the old city in
Salala. It is funny that "Thakar" means MALE in
Arabic. It makes me laugh that in spite of the legacy
of a powerful local woman like the queen of Sheba and
her involvement in global trade of frankincense, the
drink of health is of a male gender :). This takes me
back to another interrelated question on education:
What stories should education tell in order to
influence people's expression and their human
condition!?

Enjoy the pictures..

Management consulting near the next edge:  "Fifteen years ago we stumbled on an idea while consulting with a client with a severely under performing IT organization. I was overwhelmed with the employees complaining. I began collecting and categorizing their complaints and then the horror set in, a large percentage was warranted. I began asking people at all levels why they had not raised these issues earlier. The singular answer was "a fear of the consequences of being negative."

I did some research and found relatively little to support the employees perception, there were several good to great leaders in the company, the foremost being the CEO. Still, employee’s perception is their reality.

Chris Cook on disintermediated markets

it is quite possible and straightforward to achieve networked and dis-intermediated markets, at a time that risk capital is in increasingly short supply IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE RISK INTERMEDIARIES THEMSELVES to make the transition to service provision because their requirement for capital is limited to operating costs, since market price risk is with the end users.

In fact, since 2008 that is precisely what we have seen as risk intermediary banks have sold a new generation of quasi-equity funds (ETFs; Index Funds, ETPs, REITs etc etc) where the market price risk is with the investors.

What this flood of dollars into equities, precious metals and commodities - ie anything but dollars - achieved was to inflate correlated bubbles to the benefit of producers and companies.

So in a cosmic irony we have seen risk averse investors - NOT the speculators who get the blame, and who only ever cause short term spikes in price, downwards OR upwards - causing the very inflation they aimed to avoid, and exposing themselves to market price risk they were blithely unaware they were taking.

These bubbles will end, and the markets will then move to the next 'adjacent possible' which is completely dis-intermediated 'Peer to Peer' and 'Peer to Asset' markets where credit risk as well as market price risk are dis-intermediated.

The structures and instruments which enable this transition pre-date the banking system,and are already in use, albeit not widely appreciated.

These recent presentations at the Schumacher College 'Banking on Ourselves' seminar cover it.

There’s a healthiness in internal critique and desire to find solutions beyond the status quo of the moment. However, I do think it does provide a foundational element for cities and countries trying to grow a more meaningful and vibrant tech community."

http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/11/29/166156242/cornstalks-everywhere-but-nothing-else-not-even-a-bee Anyone interested in creating sort of a group blog? That is, writing a around 5 sentence association passage (one thought) each, turned-based, in compliance with a specific subject? Like we do now but more collaborately.. And anyone interested in illustrating it? The Transformation Project

This project is motivated by the belief that a much better world is possible. A world where society is in balance with nature, rather than destroying nature. A world organized around what people need and want, rather than around creating wealth for the few. A world in harmony rather than a world plagued by conflict and war. A world where people have a real voice in how their societies operate.

This project is also motivated by the observation that the current systems of society cannot be fixed. A better world calls for a whole new way of organizing things, making decisions, allocating resources, dealing with economics, etc. We need a total transformation of society: a whole new operating system for Spaceship Earth.

Using Nondominion to Evolve from Local to Global Commons - http://t.co/JfVAATmc (EVENT/FREE/UPDATE) Can't attend @TEDxBayArea #Global #Women #Entrepreneurs event this Saturday 12/1? You can watch it online! Event starts at ***9am PST http://t.co/Yob0S5g3 This is our 3rd year - the best ever! (I'll be livetweeting, too, at #TEDXBAW12). Anyone else on this list interested in ending poverty around the world? I've just posted an article on the Gates Foundation's blog about an ambitious global campaign we're launching to change the rules of the financial system.

Let me know if you want to talk about this!

http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2012/11/We-Have-the-Power-to-Change-the-Rules poll: what are your favorite sources for design & innovation news + inspiration? who are your favorite curators for that type of content? ... propose a first step in the development of an integrated theory of the emergence of distributed cognition/extended mind. Distributed cognition is seen as the confluence of collective intelligence and “situatedness”, or the extension of cognitive processes into the physical environment. Here in my native South Africa we are currently at a critical crossroads in history. It is the classic 'high road/low road scenario. Our prospects are stark: EITHER we transform and fly … or we continue the slide to oblivion. 

A major challenge is that corporate encroachment is destroying fragile neighbourhood economies in previously disadvantages townships across the country. Each time a chain-store opens one can only shudder at how many small local businesses (who were supplying critical neighbourhood needs) are impacted ... and usually obliterated. 

In return the community is "rewarded" with a number of poorly-paid jobs … and this is somehow portrayed as beneficial!

The effect is devastating …  a “self-reliance” economy is replaced by a “dependence” economy. The citizen's freedom, and fundamental right to forge his/her own future ... and a lifestyle of abundance ... is compromised. 

I believe this is going to become a major political battlefield of the near future. We understand the need to be pre-emptive by prototyping and perfecting alternative solutions … and that we need to start where revolutions are meant to begin ... at grassroots 'neighbourhood' level

THAT is what this proposal intends to do. To transform a 'dependency economy' into a thriving, profitable, self-reliant, sustainable neighbourhood economy with global ‘reach’ … by reaching out, developing relationships and tapping into the know-how, skills and other special attributes of our unique “Cowan Community” Crowd.

Please do me the honour of checking out this short slide presentation. I'd be fascinated to hear your views. 

http://www.slideshare.net/ianfalconbentley/cowan-good-to-great-programme-seed-funding-pitch02-15414293 We have online identities or self-representations. Hopefully, in the future, we will have more than just representations themselves. But some things won't change. I'm talking about greed and the need to posess, to own, to control, to stand out and well, to have more power. Facebook, Google, and a few others, they basically own our identities as they are so far, online. I don't really think this will change. We don't have a substract-independent online representation now, and I am pretty sure our uploaded minds won't be that substract-independent, we'll be submitted to and dependent on companies that work on identities and selves. I can smell excrement from afar. And this does not smell reall well. Thought folks in here would enjoy this: ... how the character and the content of the free-market ideology changed when the flag passed from Hayek to Friedman. Conservaties are, and likely to remain, more Friedman than Hayek: harder-line, more brashly confident, less concerned with getting things quite right, and without sympathy for losers.

In Arabic, French, and English, this message is clear: "communication with the international poetic movement of today as an attempt to break the isolation, and deliver the Egyptian poetic voice out of the local sphere, particularly what concerning the new special circumstances and the real threats that we face in Egypt today."

A powerful model for ALL of us. The anthem of our times: for whatever it is worth, here is a historic breaking news to share.. the US & Canada were among only 9 countries to object.

Thank you xxx "Social change takes time. It's one of the biggest problems I find with the cycles of philanthropy. We tend to work as organizations that have calendar years or fiscal years, and social change doesn't work on those schedules." I don't know if this has been shared previously to this group, but it really hit a note with me. John Seely Brown talking about making serendipity happen, the value of guilds in enabling exponential growth in knowledge and many more gems. It is long, but worth every minute. New book by a colleague at CIIS.
Complexity and Sustainability by Jennifer Wells, Routledge, 2013

Complexity has been presented as a few pieces of gold, when in fact it is a great goldmine. Complexity and Sustainability links complexity theories from throughout the disciplinary spectrum, distils one complex dynamic systems framework, and shows the value of complexity writ large for tackling issues of sustainability, such as climate change, extinctions, and the depletion of natural resources, as well as the twin problems of poverty and overconsumption...
...Scholars and scientists throughout the many disciplines focusing on sustainability will find a refreshing new perspective on the invaluable role of complex thinking and interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and collaborative approaches to transforming today's social and environmental crises into opportunities.   
 
 http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415695770 Thought some of you might be into this -- also note that if you're an artist looking to contribute your experiences and practices to the show, feel free to contact me. 

Coming soon to http://www.alterati.com 

Internal Arts is a series dealing with the creative process in its various guises: from meditative techniques to anecdotal material from independent artists.

Whether you are a writer, musician, visual or film artist, or just want to learn a little about the ins- and outs- of the creative process from those who struggle to make a living at it, this show is for you. We will also often explore meditative and movement practices that might not necessarily seem connected with creativity or the arts at first glance. These are quite possibly more important than all the discussions we will be having about independent arts and media production, as they get us out of the 'the chair,' out of our heads, and back into our bodies. It is in and through our bodies, and nowhere else, that the true creative process begins.  We are not brains in bottles. 

It's our hope that you will find these practices and conversations an indispensable part of your own practice. cc Alan Yelsey Christine Renaud The Natural Step for Sustainability - there is a working method!

We need your help to solve a 2.5 billion person challenge – the world’s toilet crisis. Toilet Hackers is launching a global sanitation hackathon to create ICT and mobile solutions that help increase access to sanitation and hygiene on December 1-2, 2012 in 24 cities globally.

The event will mobilize an unprecedented level of collaboration from disparate disciplines – sanitation and water experts, designers, software developers, engineers, health professionals, students – with the goal of hacking the world’s toilet and sanitation crisis.

Creating the Future is about to leap into making every single part of our work - every decision, every planning session, every internal training - fully open and engaged. Details at the link - and we REALLY want your reactions / thoughts / experiences. This is already huge for us, and is about to get huger (and yes, it's a word because I said so...) Neal Gorenflo and company are probably not going to post this request here. So I will. For those that don't know Shareable has always been here for those of us working to build a sustainable - shareable future. As a solo-preneur in this space nearly four years ago I truly.....truly felt crazy and alone - very alone. I started hyperlocavore.com while caring for my father who was dying of pancreatic cancer. I started it mainly as a way to stay sane in the middle of such grief and pain...to ground myself as my father died slowly in front of me going from a lion of a man to an angry agonozed husk of his old self and the economy collapsed, and we lost so so much. My family was not supportive as they were in crisis.. and thought it a waste of time. My dad on the other hand, kind of got it....and then Shareable wrote about it...and I started getting some press. That led to a bit in Martha Stewart's Living...which to my Dad's side of the family is *complete* confirmation of legitimacy. So Neal, and everyone at Shareable...your continued success is very very personal to me. I was in the desert and you were a clear pond of fresh cool water.           Why do I say all this? Well because I pass a lot of things on, efforts which are all worthy in my mind of money, support, kindness, encouragement, press - all things that Neal and Shareable gave to me at a most crucial moment in my life. Neal is probably the pivotal soul for my entrance to this very special community and in my restored confidence as a human being who wants to make a big change..(along with David Hodgson who invited me here.) I want to return the favor and the love and hope that you all will consider helping them reach their very modest goal of 10K by December 31st. It's such a tiny amount in the scheme of things! If you cannot give, share.    http://ow.ly/fxWSz #collcons #passitforward #love Check out the new video John Trautwein created for us to help the Climate Meme Project!

https://www.whatistheitu.org/ "Neuroscience has joined company with other totalizing worldviews - Marxism, Freudianism, critical theory - that have been victim to overuse and misapplication." I've been hip to this since my neighbor in grad school studied neuroscience and proudly referred to himself as a reductionist. We humans like reductionistic totalizing worldviews and seem to trade one for another.

http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/neuroscience-under-attack.xml What's wrong with us - why aren't we all doing this? Here is an interesting contribution (you will need google translator or such, article is in German), raising questions of civic society, media, technology and economic power

http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/zukunft-des-journalismus-das-heilige-versprechen-11970610.html "Lambeth is one of the 21 councils around the UK becoming a Cooperative Council. It is changing the way that it is structured, and the types of activities it does to have a greater focus on collaboration and empowerment. And to find new ways to incorporate the knowledge, resources, skills and ambition of the brilliant and diverse residents of Lambeth." Me thinks this crew would love to geek out with this cool new toy I found.  Specially cats like Kevin David Jean Jed Mark Hayley Gil Drew Liz Greg... Enjoy! http://atlas.media.mit.edu Job Postings: "IBM is recommending these companies stick a sensor in your car, measure where you go and when, your speed, acceleration and deceleration, etc. The progression over time could be to withdraw traditional insurance products, so that you won’t be able to get an insurance product without sensors attached. As this presentation offers, “The aforementioned rising tide of technology also empowers insurance underwriters to bring their products closer to realtime interaction via sensor networks and enlightened privacy regulations.”…

It’s not just sensors in your car – insurance companies are modeling tighter and tighter risk chunks. IBM goes on, saying that new products “will facilitate “just-in-time insurance” as a person moves through a set of “spaces.” Each step of the journey represents a different risk such as car-to-train-station, train-to-city-station, station-to- office, and so on. Each leg of the trip truly represents a varying amount of risk.” Tracking these movements could require nothing more than downloading an app on a smart phone, or some other device. But it is literally the application of financial engineering to your very liberty, or the toll-boothing of your life." Fascinating proof of concept, this Sundrop:

www.indiegogo.com/exitstrata

this week sees me gathering the stories of musicians working actively in relief and social change efforts worldwide, from sandy relief here in NY, to Gaza, to Egypt, and beyond. 

we receive emails daily from people who have heard about the network and the work we're doing to activate social change and creative agency using new media -- people in many cases who've never written or made art before. a good example is a security guard in an african prison, who sent us his first poem ever, and who i'm now working with to tell his story and help organize in his community.

we believe as a resource and a mouthpiece we can use online and offline publication to facilitate GREAT personal and social change on many levels.

do not confuse this with a frivolous hobby! sometimes I sit and cry with the power of the work.

today and tomorrow, you have a chance to make a gift that will go TWICE as far in this work, as our anonymous donor will match you dollar for dollar. every dollar goes to our network, our costs, our artists. we don't receive a penny for our work-- but this money helps us organize and build this organization so that we can afford to write grants and truly become the powerful resource we have already begun to be. The launch party for Alex Steffen's new ebook Carbon Zero: Imagining Cities That Can Save the Planet is this Monday.  Everyone who attends will get a free copy.

Monday marks the final day of our fundraising drive for the next issue of Exit Strata. After being hit hard and losing steam and traction to the storm and its effects on our constituency, we are abandoning our efforts to fundraise for issues two AND three and are now simply working to achieve half our original goal. We're at $2500, out of $6000. Can we do it? I think we CAN!

As I've said many times over these days, we get (and sorely need) every $ you donate, AND!!! for these next few days, your dollar goes TWICE as far, matched by an anonymous donor!

www.indiegogo.com/exitstrata I agree, but when will Hamas renounce the use of violence, and its pledge to wipe Israel off the map? Feeling immensely grateful for the extent to which discussions here stretch my thinking. There is nowhere else online that I find the richness and depth I find in this group, about topics deeply meaningful to my work. Thank you all for being part of my ongoing learning. Anybody in this group into art that can change or save the world? Can't help thinking lately that things appear complex only when we are in the middle of them. That when we step back to see the whole, the systems behind the complexity reveal a simplicity we cannot see from the middle... The present paper will sketch the basic ideas of the complexity paradigm, and then apply them to social systems, and in particular to groups of communicating individuals who together need to agree about how to tackle some problem or how to coordinate their actions. How to be an interesting YOU! The ten steps... Ceasefire is about to go into effect within an hour between Israel and Hamas on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza. Congratulations on thousands of human lives that have been spared. Egypt took a lead in facilitating the agreement. H Clinton came with a mandate from Obama which started this morning in Tel Aviv by clear pressure on Israel (No to war and no to increased tension in the Middle East). She is in Cairo right now. CNN also announced an upcoming interview with khaled Mashal the leader of Hamas by C. Amanpur at 3pm Eastern time today. It discusses the practical implications of the new theoretical approaches and their role in the sustainability of human-modified ecosystems. The book begins with a review of key properties of complex adaptive systems that contribute to overall resilience, including multiple equlibria, complexity, self-organization at multiple scales, and order. This helps me understand why Design Thinking is not the same as Systems Thinking.  These "top design thinkers" don't begin by looking at the whole system in which their work exists.

Highland withdraws Melancthon quarry plans

The proposed quarry in Melancthon is dead.
On Wednesday (Nov. 21), The Highland Companies announced it has withdrawn its application to the province for a licence to mine 2,316 acres of land in Melancthon for limestone. As a result, Highland plans to continue to focus on its farming operations.
“While we believe that the quarry would have brought significant economic benefit to Melancthon Township and served Ontario’s well-documented need for aggregate, we acknowledge that the application does not have sufficient support from the community and government to justify proceeding with the approval process,” John Scherer, principal of The Highland Companies, said in a news release.
Highland also intends to discontinue its efforts to restore the rail corridor through Dufferin County. In addition, Highland announced that John Lowndes has resigned from his role as president and has no further involvement with the company. http://www.exitstrata.com/awesome-creators-100k-musicians-for-change_letter-from-la_a-change-is-gonna-come/

Amal Alayan <3 with love to you, and love to Gaza.

I do believe Lee's words here are true: A change is on its way... I'm not surprised the old system is writhing and fighting -- I imagine it like a dragon or demon fighting as it dies. I never expected anything but fire as it goes... but I know that slash and burn leaves fertile, fertile fields. Successful innovation starts NOT with innovative strategies and approaches, but with deep consideration of our core assumptions. 

Assumptions about what we believe is possible. Assumptions about what it is to be human, living with other humans.

Until we look at those most basic of assumptions, we are simply creating new "doing" based on old thinking. And that is the recipe not only for nothing changing, but more damagingly, for our believing nothing ever will... http://santacruz.patch.com/articles/managing-the-munchies-with-superfoods Are any of you connected with the Ceres investment group?

Next Edgers might be interested in this talk by Donnie Maclurcan from the Post Growth Institute in which he outlines a macroeconomic framework based on not-for-profit enterprise at the Environmental Professionals Forum (Oct 2012) hosted by Net Balance (see http://postgrowth.org/learn/how-on-earth for more). Dear NexEdgers who participated in this debate (below) . I have posted an image of an 8-month infant which I need to investigate the credibility of its source since Adam Johnson pointed that it appears on a website on Iran from 2009. There is an ongoing cyberspace war going on between some Israelis and some Palestinians. Come to think about it, I don't recall having seen this image on any Arab Satellite TV channels reporting on Gaza over the past week which in hindsight makes my suspicions now grow about this specific image. There is ample well cross-referenced visual representation of the scale of human tragedy inflected on Gazan civilians by Israeli artillery over the past week, who needs to fake an additional image, I wonder! I have put out the question on this picture to Palestine's largest FB IT community in the West Bank and Gaza and now awaiting response. I will try to get insight into this image and get back to you on this within this thread. Until then, I feel it is only appropriate that I delete this photo. But I do not want to lose the great content of our exchange on it, so here I am cutting it and pasting it into a new Next Edge posting. Every thing said below is very valid and very worthy of reading to those interested in the issue.

Adam Johnson This really shook me Amal Alayan - it was the first thing to come up when I started facebook this morning. With a little daughter myself, it is easy to place myself in the position of the family. Awful. 

I do find myself wishing, however, that there wasn't a need for this conflict to be waged so totally. Not only on the ground, but also through social media. The idea of each side using images of dead or wounded children to bolster their cause through otherwise uninvolved people seems off to me. 

So I don't quite know what to make of it. Obviously people getting killed like this is far worse than my distaste at propaganda spreading through these channels. Maybe I'm naive in thinking that social media could be spared being used as a propaganda channel. Rephrase that - clearly I'm naive. Hopefully I don't get jumped on - while I've never been in this situation, I am trying to understand it.

Amal Alayan Adam Johnson you know.. Before getting any feedback on this image, something in me made me delete this photo from my fb timeline. Even though I remain very mindful of its context and need no literal nor metaphoric content to keep reminding me of realities that this image represents, I somehow did not want it to somehow continue to define me by having it posted along with other happy ones. I have not deleted its posting from Next Edge because I think a new world of interconnectedness and interrelatedness means that we are all given the chance to see the same image. Of course there is "democracy in the image/scene" as the leading Palestinian film maker, Elia Suleiman, also professes. Your words also take me back to a time I was at a class at MIT in the 90s when a professor (a jerk) came to me and asked me whether it is OK by me that he screens in class a documentary on the Israeli army as a lesson on excellence in technology management. Of course I said I did not find it appropriate. On a day when I was absent from class, he did screen the film. From that day onward I watched a continued DIVIDE IN NARRATIVE between the world I grew up in (the Arab World) and America, my new intellectual home. Then there was a time when the world was talking "clash of civilizations and cultures" and I was thinking why is it hard for people to recognize that it is rather a divide in narrative. I think Arab Spring refuted the later so where do we go from here ina post Arab Spring and post Occupy new 21st century world? My youngest two brothers went into cinema (even the one who is also an MIT alum). They are both San Franciscan to the core in many ways but they shoot all their award winning films in Palestine-Israel .. In my days, most Arab kids in schools wanted to get into engineering and medicine. Palestinian kids were always ahead of their peers in these disciplines. Today there is equal interest in film school as there is in such fields. Of course none of my siblings artistic films show such sad photos but nevertheless such photos form the consciousness of every Arab and Moslem around the world. For the 21st century to really be one of interconnectedness and interrelatedness, it has to be about equal access to the same image with the understanding that there is democracy in interpreting, asking questions and reaching conclusion about every image as Elia Suleiman says. I like to close with two things: 1. I had an exchange with Lori Kane yesterday about peace making between Israeli and Palestinians and told her that people will not forget these images and such images will continue to define their narrative (and I am talking about not only Palestinians but without exaggeration all Arabs and Moslems who are 1/5th of earth population). So to reach peace, yes one can work on people forgiving and people can forgive if one can work on bridging the DIVIDE IN NARRATIVE knowing the personal narrative is more authentic than national inherited or constructed narrative. Such Divide cannot be bridged by controlling minds as Israel tries to do with textbooks in schools of its Arab minority citizens inside Israel. 2. Yesterday, I went for a walk to a nearby supermarket in West Jerusalem which is not far from my parents home. On the way I stopped to pick a bottle of wine from my favorite wine store in Israel. It was heartwarming to find the same salesman I knew from a year ago who is really an expert on wine. He asked me about San Franc and then we got into a chat about the war in Gaza. The guy was insisting that all images of killed children in Gaza are not real. That they are fake. I left with my Chianti thinking, how can one start bridging a divide in narrative when there is such denial. cc Adam Scislowicz Liz McLellan Curtis Faith Leonard Mallo Georgio Bertini

Adam Johnson I think I'm with you Amal Alayan, and hopefully you weren't interpreting my comment to infer that I believe the image to be a fake or to downplay the conflict. I also appreciate (now) the point in relation to understanding images such as this so that we can come some way to bridging the divide in narrative (a very true expression). To not know that this image and others exist (I'm thinking of the Palestinian boy shot while seeking protection behind his father) makes for a gulf in understanding.

I guess my point was more rueful - both sides of this conflict use images like this to galvanise people around their cause, and social media is just the latest mechanism for distribution. And, for all of the incredible tools at our disposal to bridge communication gaps (such as here), they are also seen by some as just another weapon in the arsenal.

Before any offence is taken, I hasten to add that I am not accusing you of using horrific images to further the propagandist's cause. More reflecting on the nature of the social media thing.

And at the heart of it all, this is such an incredibly sad thing that I cannot look at it but continue to be drawn to it.

Amal Alayan Adam Johnson this is why we need more creative people, including comedians like Job Stewart my most favorite "DJ" on reporting images. I heard that yesterday the foreign minister of Turkey collapsed into tears at a hospital in Gaza. Now this guy is described as one of the most shrewd well rounded politicians of our time! He could not believe his eyes. This tells us that results of excessive random use of force in such densely populated area that has been under siege for 7 years need no media to amplify it. Media at best can bridge divides in access to realities that are defining around the globe.

Jeff Aitken I deeply appreciate your framing the image as an invitation to dialogue. For some years in the 80s I sent images of similar sadness to the IRS stapled to my tax returns as a protest against taxes funding the US/USSR nuclear arms race. They were images of burned children from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In hindsight I doubt that I converted any temporary employees in the Fresno offices, but I felt myself part of a movement of awareness that swept the world (it was by far not the only action I was taking.) What this image tells me is that war is hell and must be ended as a means to wage deep conflicts. I agree and have felt that for decades. It deepens and makes more urgent the question of unpacking a road to managing the conflicts in Israel/Palestine (and US involvement) and finally a reconciliation among the cultures and political systems, tho the urgency is certainly felt around the world just from the headlines. One of the reasons I asked if you Amal had a 'transformative' inquiry to share was in search of those urgent, 'wicked' questions that might transform the narrative...

Jeff Aitken It's really a challenge to see the power of spreading awareness when it takes so damn long to end a war. The movement to end the war in Iraq was more effective than the famous movement to end the war in Vietnam, by a number of measures, even tho it didn't feel that way. But in both cases it took too damn long. We can get better at it.

We have previous examples to learn from, and our core competence is learning from the past. And armed with these advantages, we’re probably going to screw this up as badly as the music people did."

Transforming the System with Evolutionary Revolution (11/17/12 Draft)

Since the birth of centralized agriculture, the wealthy have used their advantages to benefit themselves, their friends, and their families at the expense of others. This quest for wealth and power has been the driving force in every society.
 
Like any system, our global social system consists of inter-dependent elements that work together to serve a particular function – that is, to enable those with wealth and power to increase their wealth and power. 

Its key elements include: the government, the economy, mainstream media, and education; informal institutions such as the family; our culture; and ourselves as individuals, who reinforce the system.
Individuals and groups have to be accountable for their actions, but no one element controls the system, which is self-perpetuating and for which we are all responsible.
 
Without opposing public pressure, society becomes increasingly top-heavy, unstable, and undemocratic. The culture becomes more materialistic, dehumanized, and authoritarian, and individuals become more goal-oriented, competitive, and selfish. 

Goals

To create a new society, we need to establish that humanity’s primary mission is to serve the human family. If we balance self-interest and community needs, and protect the planet, we can take care of ourselves and our families as well as our nation and the global community. Self-empowerment fosters community empowerment. 
With a deep, clear commitment to evolutionary revolution, we can steadily transform society with reforms that improve living conditions. 

Means
 
Because life is mysterious, wonderful, and awe-inspiring, human beings cherish beauty, spread joy, love others as they love themselves, and foster strong communities that nurture personal development, caring relationships, and healthy families. 
 
The Gandhi-King Three-fold Path -- nurturing personal development; creating model communities based on mutual support; and engaging in political action -- enables us to move forward with compassion. 
*By engaging in ongoing personal development, we can undo our negative conditioning. We can, for example, become less arrogant, self-centered, competitive, judgmental, and dominating (or submissive). 
*By building model communities, we can demonstrate the kind of society we seek and grow joyous communities that attract others.
*By undertaking political campaigns focused on achievable objectives and win-win solutions rooted in the quest for reconciliation through negotiation, we can build momentum by improving public policy. 
 
These efforts reinforce one another. If we integrate the personal, the social, and the political, we can strengthen each effort. 
By becoming better human beings, we better serve others and our environment. Strong communities nurture strong individuals and provide a foundation for effective political action. Effective political action enhances personal strength and builds social infrastructure.
 
If we act from love, honor our values, match our means with our goals, and support each other's personal growth, we can move toward holistic, fundamental transformation. With teamwork, participatory democracy, and collective wisdom, we can create a better world that will stand the test of time.

From Naom Chomsky on Gaza.. Via Jennifer Rittenhouse West Hi folks, I'm back working in Japan in the 3.11 disaster area.  Lately I've been deeply impressed by the ways in which people in Fukushima are stepping forward with clear purpose and deep commitment to make new lives.

While it is true that many are still paralyzed by grief, and others simply are trying to pretend everything is okay, there is a determined, growing group of people who know three things:

1.  This is our home.
2.  The past is gone.
3.  The only future we have is the one we create together.

Last weekend I was at the Fukushima Kaigi, an amazing community congress which surpasses anything I've seen in 30+ years.  I've written a little about it at:  http://www.newstories.org/fukushima-a-community-creates-its-future-bob-stilgers-notes-from-japan-38-november-13th/.

Be well! "as Ito sees it, the formal channels of academia today inhibit progress. "In the old days, being relevant was writing academic papers. Today, if people can't find you on the internet, if they're not talking about you in Rwanda, you're irrelevant. That's the worst thing in the world for any researcher. The people inventing things might be in Kenya, and they go to the internet and search. Funders do the same thing. The old, traditional academic channel is not a good channel for attracting attention, funding, people, or preventing other people from competing with you.

"Being open, you're much less likely to have someone competitive emerge and you're also much more likely to find somebody who wants to come to work with you. Innovation is happening everywhere -- not just in the Ivy League schools. And that's why we're working with you guys [at Wired] too -- in the old days, academics didn't want to be in popular magazines. Openness is a survival trait." "

Impressed with these doers. Dear friends,

I feel it is really imperative that I write a book about the p2p transformations, and I plan to do this in the 2nd half of 2013. The problem is I can't afford to take time off without income, but lecturing tours pretty much preclude the concentration necessary for writing a book. Two options are crowdfunding and grants.

@David Assai suggested the Soros fellowship, see below

The criteria of "the promotion of civil society and social inclusion" certainly seems to fit.

However, I'm not good at this. Anybody familiar with the SF who can do some handholding and offer support in the admin process would be very welcome. I can do this starting mid-december when I'm back home in Chiang Mai for two months.

http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/grants/open-society-fellowship happy weekend, folks!

you know, it's not a weekend for everyone.

for people in the arts, who struggle to support their small organizations and their creative work, it's not only another work day -- for there are no days "off" for a true creative spirit -- but it's often a day when we have to tell that work to wait for us for just a few more hours while we go to job #2 or 3 to make the money it requires to, oh, I don't know, run a small arts non profit / artists cooperative / magazine

did you know Exit Strata started a crucial fundraising campaign right before Sandy hit the eastern seaboard? did you know we were planning to be sending our issue to print right now and are having to push it back until january? did you know that we only hit around $2000 of our $12000 goal, which even then still only covers costs for the next year?

the good news is, you still have time to help out. 
and, that, unlike kickstarter, we receive every $ you give, even if we don't reach that goal.

PLEASE help us, but if you can't, forward on the link to someone who might be able to, or who can share it as well? every pair of eyes is another artist, musician, or writer we can serve with the funds from this campaign.

www.indiegogo.com/exitstrata More urgent market news: 

My friends in Chicago have all ganged up to avenge the theft of their money from MF Global by the Wall St. Bankers led by Democratic governor of NJ John Corzine who stole the Chicago money. My friend Rotchy Barker in Chicago is good friends with the Republican Senators from several Western states. It's Republicans and Democrats in Chicago against the Romney Banker thieves.

I don't know if Obama knows, but I find it hard to believe he wouldn't have heard about it.

Heard Romney's money guys are pissed and that's what tanked the market yesterday. They sent out lots of Twitter texts to Christian groups saying that If Obama was elected they'd tank the markets.

Search #RomneysRevenge on Facebook and Twitter and you'll find it.

So please tell everyone to get out of the markets and have their money wired out of Wall St. banks today. ING and TD are okay for retirement accounts. Big banks are not.

Gold is not good. 

If they can't sell, have them convert to cash USD paper dollars. If anyone asked why they took the money out, the Chicago guys are telling people to say "We're on the side of the MF Global Avengers, not Romney's Revenge" at the bank. 

Swiss Francs cash paper are good too. No Euros

Do not worry about retirement charges, they'll pale in comparison to the complete loss that the MF Global traders took. Google MF Global for more.

This is very serious. I just spent the whole morning talking with the guys who run $ billions in the commodities markets and they are going to put the hammer down. Thor's day - Thursday is what they are calling it.

A good conversion for today is to take stock money and put it into: $TMF and putting a few grand into $15 strike price put options one week out at no more than $0..05 cents will be a great investment for the next week. Facebook is going to crash when the banks have to get cash out to save themselves. See: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB121117C00015000

I'll be on Twitter and StockTwits:

https://twitter.com/inflector

http://stocktwits.com/inflector

to answer questions if people have any.

Feel free to pass this around. I'm worried the banksters are going to play dirty like they did with MF Global. They stole the money. That's why you need to get out of big banks and into cash hard currency or local banks.

And tell people that the Chicago MF Global Avengers team wants people's personal commitment to donate any excess profits from today to the Sandy effort. Details to follow.

The MF Global Avengers group has committed to use any profits to return money to retirees who lose, and for Sandy and other disaster relief. But get caught in the crossfire, that make take a while to sort out. The safest bet is hard cash currency

"I agree that the failure of government regulation to curb the destructive activity of large corporations is only likely to worsen with the increasing privatization of government and the increasing complexity of global problems. So what can p2p culture do about this?

1. Establish powerful, confederated P2P Guilds and Leagues based on various global commons of knowledge and expertise so that mitigations, adaptations, and other interventions can be crowd-sourced by massively distributed, parallel, and open networks of peers.

2. Establish many strong, self-reliant economies at the local geopolitical (or Eco-political) level by forming partnerships between the P2P guilds and progressive local communities. These partnerships would maximize economies of scope via peer production and  would also be strongly confederated with their peers bio-regionally, nationally, and globally.

3. One more maneuver that may be necessary to assist this process I will dub “castling”, a term borrowed from the game of chess. What I mean by this is a shifting of local populations between adjacent local geopolitical jurisdictions (such as cities and counties in the US) so as to create political, social, and economic majorities of p2p culture in the targeted locations. Those locations that are simultaneously abandoned by p2p culture are essentially “sacrificed” to the corporate predators. (Half a loaf saved is better than none.)

The resulting strongly confederated p2p cultural strongholds might stand the best chance of competing with the large corporate entities, excluding them from the “castled” commons, and limiting the scope of their environmental destruction."

What are their advantages *in practice*?
What are their proven effects? "A well-known facet of ecosystems is that the edges—the boundaries or transitions from one ecosystem to another—often exhibit high levels of species richness or biodiversity. These transitional areas often show features of species
composition, structure, and function representative of the ecosystems they transcend, as well as having their own unique array of species and characteristics. Cultural transitional areas—zones where two or more cultures converge
and interact—are similarly rich and diverse in cultural traits, exhibiting cultural and linguistic features of each of the contributing peoples. This results in an increase in cultural capital, and resilience, by providing a wider range
of traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom on which to draw, especially in times of stress and change. We propose that indigenous peoples whose living territories traverse ecological edges have a correspondingly increased access
to economically important resources and therefore have a greater capacity for ﬂexibility. Finally, we suggest that indigenous peoples are drawn to areas having a high incidence of ecological edges, and furthermore, that they actively create and maintain ecological edges. This practice provides them with a greater diversity of cultural capital and helps to maintain their ﬂexibility and resilience. Examples from several regions of Canada are provided, from the southern interior of British Columbia, to the Lake Winnipeg watershed of Manitoba and Ontario, to James Bay."

At Jigsaw, we made a terrible mistake. We pit "talk" vs. "acting." Sounds good, right? We all know about groups that talk, talk, talk about what they're going to do, but never act.

So we defined ourselves as "actors" rather than "talkers." Ain't that swell? And it seemed to work. Except that it didn't. Sure, we put on events -- and sometimes people came. But people quickly stopped attending, and then the diminished core of Jigsaw people asked, "Why aren't people becoming members?"

Well, what is Jigsaw about?

Oooh -- don't ask that question.

Jigsaw vision?

Oooh -- don't ask that question.

Those are *TALKERS* questions. People who are "all talk" are people who talk about vision, purpose, meaning. We are ACTORs! We don't talk! We ACT! We're the real people!

That's been the attitude, and, sadly, that is STILL the attitude.

---

Here is how my viewpoint has developed.

First -- personal relationships and vision are absolutely essential to a meaningful, active, and exciting organization.

Do they talk about ideas and vision and purpose and relationships at Damanhur? YES. ALL THE TIME. This is proof positive that "talk" is not the enemy of "action."

OK then -- what about the original problem? What about the "talkers"? What separates the talkers from the doer's?

Here's what I think it is. It's not about "talking is evil." Rather, it's about DECISION.

If poeple have not DECIDED to do a thing, then the people will just talk endlessly.

The enemy is not talking! The enemy is INDECISION.

Let me repeat: There is nothing wrong with people talking. In fact, for a powerful group, you absolutely NEED talking. There is nothing contradictory between people who have a really solid sense of each other, who each other and what they're about, -- and a highly effective core. This book - full - attempts to address some of the interesting questions that revolve around the formation and dissolution of human societies in general. Specifically whether, and how, we can shape the nature of cohesion present in modern societies.

Sometimes the story is not within the data, but rather beside it. Emergent futures are as much narrated as they are identified. While it's true that much of the dynamic in America ties back to the "north-south" cultural divide (albeit now geographically more dispersed), there's a deeper dynamic at play between greco-roman culture and judeo-christian culture, as the former has slowly become ascendent again ever since the collapse of the medieval synthesis wherein the judeo-christian sublated and tamed the greco-roman for a long while.

Would you agree? I've been driven half mad trying to re-find an article (blog?) that I read in the past 24 hours regarding the use of scenario planning in environmental work. It was making a case to say that this is a new thing, using the formal tools developed in the context of nuclear weapons and military "wargames", and applying it to environmental  work.

I skimmed it on my phone and thought that I'd like to come back to it, but have now lost it. Did anybody see the article too and can point me in the right direction? For all I know it was here... The impact of complex systems on science is a recent, ongoing and profound revolution. The scale and sweep of the change is truly vast — entire disciplines or subdisciplines have come into being, departments and institutes of hundreds of scientists now exist that did not exist two decades ago. Cheryl Heller sees design thinking and learning empathy as bullsh*t, and explains what many entrepreneurs are doing wrong http://ow.ly/feiqU Given it is now 14 years old, this paper may be old news to all, but being new to the school of thought I found Jay Forrester's paper on "Designing the Future" from 1998 is a good opening up of ideas regarding designing social systems and enterprises. 

Are there key papers in the field you suggest I look at that have developed his thinking?

"The Big Pivot" - Part I

http://www.wwtid.com/2012/11/11/the-big-pivot-part-i/ A professor at a university business school contacted me today.  Some within the university are trying to gather momentum to add a Sustainability major.  He feels that they've already missed the boat and should get started on what comes after sustainability.  He wants to propose thrivability, but he needs examples and content ideas.  What would you suggest to him?

How they are evolving, where they should be heading, in particular to adapt to change and uncertainty, and to adopt more resilient practices.

I'm aware of the developments in P2P production and the networked economy. How does this spell out in mainstream business? Is there any relevant work to refer to? Are there any examples, case studies of compelling transformations, or radically different structures at work in large scale organizations?

"For anyone scratching their head about how to understand the deeper social and economic dynamics of online networks, a terrific new report has been released by Michel Bauwens called Synthetic Overview of the Collaborative Economy.  Michel, who directs the Foundation for Peer to Peer Alternatives and works with me at the Commons Strategies Group, is a leading thinker and curator of developments in the emerging P2P economy. 

The report was prepared for Orange Labs, a division of the French telecom company, as a comprehensive survey and analysis of new forms of collaborative production on the Internet.  The report is a massive 346 pages (downloadable as a pdf file under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license) and contains 543 footnotes.  But it is entirely clear and accessible to non-techies.  Unlike so many popular books on this subject that are either larded with colorful hyperbole and overly long anecdotes, or arcane technical detail, the Bauwens report cuts to the chase, giving tightly focuses analyses of the key principles of online cooperation.  The report is meaty, informative, comprehensive and well-documented."

Sweden Eager to Import Garbage from Bulgaria
 
Sweden's waste incineration plants generate 20 percent of Sweden’s district heating.
  
Sweden has run out of garbage and has been forced to import thrash from its other countries, with Bulgaria, Romania, Italy and the Baltic countries considered possible options.
 
The peculiar news has been prompted by the Nordic country's reliance on waste to heat and to provide electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes through a longstanding waste-for-energy incineration program.
 
Since recycling is extremely popular in Sweden and only 4% of all waste generated in the country is landfilled, it has been forced to import waste from Norway.
 
"We have more capacity than the production of waste in Sweden and that is usable for incineration," Catarina Ostlund, a senior advisor for the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, has explained, as cited by Mother Nature Network.
 
Ostlund has suggested that Norway might not be the perfect partner for a trash import-export scheme.
 
"I hope that we instead will get the waste from Italy or from Romania or Bulgaria or the Baltic countries because they landfill a lot in these countries," she has told PRI.
 
"They don't have any incineration plants or recycling plants, so they need to find a solution for their waste."

They do not reduce such problems to the scale of the tools available to them, or hide behind those tools when they know they are partial and inadequate.

FACEBOOK EVENT: https://www.facebook.com/events/457663557608226/ Worried about the economy? It's the environment, stupid (This is the title of the article as written by the author)

29 October, 2012
 
No credible economic policy can ignore the fact that the fate of one is wholly dependent on the other
 
'The chancellor doesn’t seem to understand that you simply can’t have a healthy economy without a healthy environment.'
 
In recent weeks a slew of stories has hit the news about the soaring price of food, petrol and household energy – and the financial pressure this is putting on cash-strapped households. But as politicians scrabble around for the best short-term fix, a fundamental cause underpinning much of these economic woes is often overlooked. Under the bonnet, there's something big going on: we're damaging the planet and draining its resources, and it's starting to cost us big time.
 
With growing confidence scientists are linking climate change to the increasingly freakish weather around the globe which is causing food prices to rise. Earlier this month the National Farmers' Union predictedmore price rises when it revealed that wet weather had cut UK wheat yields by 15%.
 
Natural resources are not infinite and with developing economies growing fast, we're beginning to discover that there are not enough to go round. You only have to look at your energy bills to see the predictable effect this all has. According to energy regulator Ofgem, our gas and electricity bills have sharply risen principally because of the rocketing price of fossil fuels, driven by international demand. In 2011 the price of natural gas was the biggest cause of increases in domestic energy bills, which were somewhere in the region of £200.
 
And it's the same story with oil prices: up, up, up, with all that entails when you fill your car at the pump. All of this hits the poorest hardest, with more than 5m households now in fuel poverty, and "transport poverty" – where people cannot afford to travel and so struggle to find work or access services - a stark and growing problem.
 
But faced with all the evidence, no one on the political scene is showing the kind of leadership required. They prefer to squabble about short-term sticking-plaster policies, like the perennial scrap about a few pence on or off fuel duty. David Cameron recently got into lots of bother on the issue of unfair energy tariffs which, while not a trivial nut to crack, is a sideshow to the real economics of bill rises.
 
The biggest problem is the chancellor, who doesn't seem to understand that in the long term you simply can't have a healthy economy without a healthy environment. By pitting the two against each other, he ignores not just the CBI – which says green and growth must go together – but cold, hard, economic reality. In claiming, contrary to the evidence, that "gas is cheap", George Osborne has become a modern day King Cnut, attempting to turn back the tide of evidence on the rising price of gas by flat out denying it – and, indeed, pushing to keep the economy hooked on the stuff. This is especially galling from a man who reportedly accuses environmental advocates of acting like the Taliban. If anything it's Osborne, with his reckless dash for gas, who wants to keep us in the dark ages.
 
The writing has been on the wall for years – indeed some enlightened parts of the business community have even helped write it. It's more than a decade since the Association of British Insurers warned of the impact of more frequent and more severe flooding as a result of climate change.
 
In 2006 the review into the economics of climate change by former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern convinced Tony Blair of the sound economic case for action. This was hinged on the central argument that it will be cheaper to prevent climate change than to deal with its costs and impacts, which also fall disproportionately on the least well-off. We're now seeing the very beginnings of what Lord Stern was getting at.
 
A broad church of organisations, all with a stake in wishing to avoid economic mayhem and keen to see a green-powered economic recovery, now gets that green is working: manufacturers, unions, businesses, consumer groups, faith groups, and poverty campaigners. It's time our political leaders – of all hues and persuasions – did too.
 
• David Powell is economics campaigner at Friends of the Earth I am trying hard to get to the social business summit, but cant afford it. Yunus is opening a scotland based foundation, a grameen bank for the unbanked in scotland offering fair credit and conditions of repayment. In ireland there is no credit, the socialization of private debt is performing the offsale of our natural resources and destruction of public services, I am preparing myself to deal with these issues and with the  social fabric's reestablishment. I cannot do it based on my own resources and yet I am very reluctant to ask for help, the people with whom I work in LA have offered 400 dollars to support me, but with tickets at 1300$ and flights etc I cannot afford it, and yet so much depends on the flowering of possibility in a shrinking window of time...up to now I could not bring myself to ask the community for money and I'm still very unsure, this may be cultural, i have happily helped others in their valiant efforts as part of crowdfunding campaigns, or personal appeals from obviously pivotal characters in the p2p movement but , perhaps due to my cultural background, I cant seem to put myself forward in the same place...i am not moneyed, have been on disability with chronic digestive issues since hospitalization in 2008...what do people seeing this thread think of this situation? For those who deem even this post as inappropriate, well lets look at the issue generally, rather than specifically, how do you weight these appeals? I have always had problems asking on my own behalf for anything I haven't earned, yet when we look at work from the unpaid perspective and get to a point when our contributions start to be impactful in the development of not our personal situations, but in the development of the social fabric itself, to whom do we turn?

Well, that was just a preliminary sketch for a written piece I just finished which thoroughly flushes out the concept, and how it fits within sustainability, thrivability, resilience, etc.  

Long story short... this is a POWERFUL tool in the changemakers arsenal and one that I highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with. Of course I'd love any feedback you may have below... muchas gracias amigos! : ) All our cities and towns should have hundreds of coops in many market sectors. A big one would be clean/green energy. We should have solar energy coops (including solar-thermal power stations and distributed photovoltaics OEM//installers) patterned after the old rural electric coops, and ethanols coops patterned after farmers coops but using cellulosic and waste feed stocks and producing feed & fertilizer byproducts. We should have mobile phone, computer tech, and electronics coops. Also coop farmers' markets,  community supported agriculture, and community garden coops.. One of my favorite ideas: A Green Coop Mall with all kinds of retail and service coops sharing facilities, marketing, financing, etc. That can also include a coop incubator. The opportunities are endless, and this is the way to build a progressive, democratic counter-economy that would provide a permanent economic base for our political movements. http://almanac2010.wordpress.com/green-free-enterprise/ Sandy is estimated to cost $50b. The World Trade centre replacement cost about $5b. So should Homeland Security be defending our borders against terrorists, or should they be defending our government from the oil, coal and gas industry purchasing its inaction on climate change - the principle cause of Sandy's destructiveness. Hello everyone!  I've just been added to your august ranks and I wanted to introduce myself.  I'm a filmmaker and writer currently based in London.  Over the past two years I've researched, written, directed, produced and narrated a feature documentary, Critical Mass, on the impact of human population growth and consumption on our planet and on our psychology.  You can find out more about the film at our website - http://www.criticalmassfilm.com, our FB page - http://www.facebook.com/CriticalMassFilm, our Twitter - @CriticalMassDoc and our Indiegogo fundraising campaign - htp://www.indiegogo.com/CriticalMass.  I hope to get to know you all better in the future, and I look forward to learning from you all.  Thank you.

We thought you might be interested in the new release of the collaborative federated social network Kune: Kune codename "Ostrom" http://kune.cc  Kune is focused in real-time collaboration (not just communication), in building (not just in sharing). This new release is fully multi-lingual, supporting 12 languages, and with multiple improvements. It is coined "Ostrom" as a homage to the Nobel Prize of Economics Elinor Ostrom, who demonstrated how the Commons can be managed by their communities in a better and more successful way than how the State and the Market manage them.

Kune aims to be a free/libre decentralized social network, so you would stop using Facebook. It provides real-time simultaneous collaborative edition of documents so you can stop using Google Docs and wikis. It allows you to communicate in discussion lists, so you stop using mailing lists and Google/Yahoo/MSN Groups. It provides group calendars so you forget about Google Calendar. It provides chat compatible with Gmail/Jabber chat accounts of your friends. It allows galleries of images, videos, maps or any rich contents, so you can stop using Flickr/Youtube. It provides multiple other tools for collaboration such as polls, doodles, or add-ons (same way as the Firefox add-ons). It is an advanced mail inbox so you use less and less your classical e-mail. And eventually, it will allow publishing contents to the general public so you would be able to create your own customized group web-pages without needing any CMS (WordPress, Drupal, etc). Your vote can change lives. YES! it really can!

Cheers! I had an epiphany today, People reason much  better than I was giving us credit for. The problem seems to be that all the fools are reasoning from inadequate flawed data largely funded by personal opinion, beliefs. For example, Most people are willing to believe that THEIR data and resources are generally (dependably) superior to those they disagree with.

Unenlightened self-interest is still responsible rational self-interest, just poorly funded. Douglas Adams may have been closer to the truth than anyone thought. Pan-dimensional mice may not be sponsoring life on earth and earth itself, but it may turn out that the human species is closer to being a autonomous crowd-sourced difference engine.  We seem obsessed with systematically organizing data. Often being forced to back up and reorganize according to the next paradigm.

Good data exists but it does not have the memetic power of sexy ideologies.

I'm beginning to think our problems may be less related to failure of intelligence that failure to grasp how much of what we would like to believe are only plausible beliefs and not the certainties we hope (a futile hope, I suspect) will eventually be supported by more and better data.

While I'm busy being amazed at the foolish stuff people believe and cling to, no doubt that many of them are perceiving the ideas I support, and wondering the exact same things about me! my friends Maureen OHara & Graham Leicester will be running a workshop in SF around their new book in a couple of weeks time - i hope a few of you will be able to make it... details below :) In Stockholm? check this out: http://ungamotermentorer.se/ Does anyone know of open source apps for tracking land auctions in a community, along the lines of http://WhyDontWeOwnThis.com ? (h/t Sam Rose)

I'd love to see such an app become part of a toolkit for philanthropies that aim to help economically challenged communities.

Land values can rise sharply when neighborhood residents in such communities pull together (for cleanup/fixups, crime watches, public art projects, tutoring/peer learning etc).

Given this, local philanthropies might monitor upcoming land auctions and offer matching funds to help well-regarded neighborhood groups bid for abandoned properties.

Subsequent donor support could be keyed to progress - clips uploaded to Youtube re fixups and art projects, drops in crime stats, etc.

These improvements, in turn, would add to the value of assets in each neighborhood land trust, helping make participating grassroots organizations more self-sustaining.

Has anyone heard from Venessa Miemis ? New post: social innovation and smart data are driving a social change enlightenment. http://ow.ly/eTKVj This is inspirational, especially his points at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntwqVDzdqAU Interesting... yes but overall I am not sure Thanks Floris Koot for starting this visual directory! a vancouver lovely, Ian MacKenzie is coming to your neck of the woods... In 2008, The National Intelligence Council wrote a report of future trends and scenarios for government agencies. In it, they describe a fictitious "October Surprise" weather event that shuts NYC down and demonstrates the vulnerability of our infrastructure to climate change. Read pages 57 - 59. The fictitious POTUS of 2020 even writes about how the Chinese are rioting over the pollution killing them and demanding clean air and water (as is happening this week in Ningbo).

Read the whole document if you can. These are trends we need to act upon, because they are coming home to roost much more quickly than anyone thought possible. "It is a cliché that I personally associate with NPR—not merely because announcers on that network tend to hymn the vibrant with complete indifference to the word’s exhaustion, but because they always seem to believe they are saying something really fresh and profound about a place or a “scene” when they tag it thus. But the real force behind our mania for the vibrant is the nation’s charitable foundations. For organized philanthropy, “vibrant” seems to have become the one-stop solution for all that ails the American polis. A decade ago there were other obsessions: multiculturalism, or public-private synergy, or leadership programs. But now, it’s Get southern Illinois some vibrancy, and its troubles are over."

http://thebaffler.com/past/dead_end_on_shakin_street Getting a visceral sense of an issue, a hypothesis, or a proposal across seems to be a key potential bottleneck for groups trying to get word out about their mission, needs and opportunities. Motivational graphics came on early and we see many of them daily here. Infographics seem to have popped up next... giving more detailed and cognitive picture that retained some accessibility for the less cognitive among us, YouTube has also been a venue for informational campaigns.

Today it seems clear that information is coming at everyone hot and fast; possibly too fast for many people to usefully assimilate or access adequately. This morning I have been trying to get my head around Hurricane Sandy and why a Cat.1 hurricane is as significant as Sandy obviously is (largest diameter wind field perhaps) And the questions leads me to want to reconsider what I understand about communication and information sharing in the public interest.

No matter how good our ideas are, if we cannot share them and get them across in a deep and visceral way that almost immediately inspires engagement in the recipients, we will not get far , nor get anywhere fast enough in breaking situations ... which almost everything seems determined to become.

I've been skimming meta-infographics to see if I can find some agreed on common denominators for turning information into more efficient vectors of memetic "infection". 

Any commentary or links would be appreciated.

Here's a Forbes Infographic on "the elevator pitch". Info yes, there is some but it does not appear too visceral or engaging to me tho. This Friday at noon in SF -- Celebrate the Giants come-back Win with a traditional financier going up against Wall Street. Contact me for"Friends of David Hodgson

We're working on developing something with Markus A. O. Loponen and Alex Lavigne-Gagnon and others focusing for the moment on the basis architecture to enable modular open source development. Still working on the road map. Thank you Alan Yelsey for letting me know about corporate philosopher Richard Hames. I enjoyed this recent article of his: Religion. Not going away. Moving on...While it's a commonplace for fundamentalists and bible thumpers or koran obsessives to reduce all spirituality to decontextualized references to scriptural verses, I've noticed that those in the strong anti-religion crowd have been co-opted into this same absurd practice. Note: trying to make a point, let alone a life, from a biblical or koranic verse is like trying to make a meal with a single ingredient. NO self-respecting or worthwhile spiritual tradition uses select verses in isolation - this is but one ingredient to which exegesis and its history, theology and its history, discourse, dialogue, scholarship, lived life, art, science, philosophy, law, culture, individual conscience, collective wisdom, and modern knowledge are all brought to bear. It is a starting point, not an ending point. A signifier, never the signified. This obsession with bible (or koran) verses, whether pro or con, has become obscene, and unworthy of a civilized person or people. So join me in calling BS on it, regardless of who does it. well, I see this storm as a gift from nature/god/whatever name you use to create and spend time working towards change from home -- supporting our indiegogo campaign and helping others with their own nonprofit fundraising.

http://www.innocentive.com/ Tool needed: Seb Paquet : Investors who are investing in companies that create a blend of social and environmental value while creating financial value for investors lack a holistic tool for measuring their impact and assessing their risk, guiding execution against a plan. Their social metrics report on things like jobs created, number of children making it out of high school whose parents are doing well enough via the social enterprise to afford a second bedroom (the two factors are correlated; having your own bedroom helps you do better in school) and the metrics on the environmental side; in one instance a local mexican village’s livelihoods and incomes are greatly increased by having their local salt flat quality greatly improved by having a mangrove swamp restored using permaculture techniques. That environmental improvement allowed the creation of a branded, premium salt sold to local ecotourists and in the fair trade market. The mangrove swamp was restored by an environmentally focused investor, who wanted to increase the viability of the spawning ground of leather head turtles. The turtle’s viability is enhanced by people buying salt so local people are not forced to poach turtles to increase their protein consumption, but the environmental investor has no way to evaluate the social investment risk side of the equation. So neither side, lacking a holistic tool has a way to look at a linked, systemic creation of financial and social and environmental value. So co investments between social and environmental investors are small and not scalable since neither has a translation tool for risk assessment, due diligence, and measurement of the success and problems with impact investment used in a holistic way to create value for people, planet and investors.

Am beginning an engagement to look at the human resources and labour market demands of the non-profit sector in British Columbia, Canada.  The group has been working for a few years on a labour market strategy, but it is based on moving targeted groups off employment insurance and into "careers" in the not for profit sector.  

Myriad problems with this of course, but what I want to bring to the strategy is a sense of what is emerging in the not for profit sector.  i want to build a large part of the process around emerging voices, and I want them to deeply consider the major shifts that could come the way this kind of work is done in the next 30 years so that we can bring people into the sector with the skills to function, transform and participate with joy in the sector for the rest of their working lives.

So what should I be looking at? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YZhlScTZ-8Y hi all. i just did a huge roundup of creativity/innovation card decks (thanks to the help of some of you!). here's the list.. let me know if there are any great ones we missed. :) Hello Next Edge folks. I am participating on the Task Force for Social Innovation in Illinois (US). As part of our outreach efforts, we are researching what other cities, states, regions, and countries have done to support the ecosystem of social innovation. I know you are all a better filter and search tool than google. What do you think is the best out there? Join the discussion today @ ECONOLOGICS – Incisive Knowledge Converged!

A group of experts warns inevitable and simultaneous implosion of energy, food, water and money systems!

Note @ ecoNVERGE: One can wonder who is blaming who! Apparently the ones responsible for the current chaos are the ones that lift up their arms to say ‘it wasn’t me!’ A lot of blame is put on the governments, but we believe the same can be said about the ‘leaders’ of the giant multinationals who are continuing to strike money without conscious and have and continue to throw people on the street with the ten thousands. Where is the value for humanity! Have we really gone insane! – Albert Einstein was right and he didn’t know how human society would degrade itself to ZERO!

http://www.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/holland-on-emergence/

This is a somewhat dry book. But, it's worth slogging your way through it. If you do make the journey, you'll come out understanding how to think scientifically about how and why things emerge. 

In general, in sciences looking at dynamic systems, people have traditionally tended to gather data in the form of statistics, snapshots of data about what has happened. There are real limits to the statistical analysis approach to understanding a dynamic system. You can only learn so much from snapshots  of the past about how a system lives and breathes. Even if you can see the variables at play, how will you know what might happen if some of the variables change? John Holland was/is one of the first, and best scientific explorers of models of complex systems. Simulations of dynamic reality. 

In statistical analysis approaches, you find and gather data after events have taken place. In complex systems models, you will not know outcomes, nor will you have data, until you run the model, and *generate* data. 

Most of the human species struggles with our innate capacity to simulate *before* we actualize. Here's where we are at as a species with simulation: We can spend billions of dollars and thousands of hours simulating whole fictional worlds and technologies enough to fool the brain into believing they exist long before they actually do, all for entertainment and diversion from reality. John Holland is one of the pioneers in applying our capacity for simulation *to* problem solving in reality.  What if people spent billions on tickets to a complex systems model about our most pressing problems as a species, instead of on a movie? This important project needs $230,000 in the next 54 hours.  Please help them make this happen - they must reach goal to keep any of the funds.

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone Adapting a sophisticated climate model, researchers show that there is plenty of wind available to supply half to several times the world's total energy needs within the next two decades.
 
BY ANDREW MYERS
 
If the world is to shift to clean energy, electricty generated by the wind will play a major role – and there is more than enough wind for that, according to new research from Stanford and the University of Delaware.
 
Researchers at Stanford University's School of Engineering and the University of Delaware developed the most sophisticated weather model available to show that not only is there plenty of wind over land and near to shore to provide half the world's power, but there is enough to exceed the total demand by several times, even after accounting for reductions in wind speed caused by turbines.
 
'The careful siting of wind farms will minimize costs and the overall impacts of a global wind infrastructure on the environment,' said Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. 'But, as these results suggest, the saturation of wind power availability will not limit a clean-energy economy.'
 
The findings were published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) by Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford, and Cristina Archer, an associate professor of geography and physical ocean science and engineering at the University of Delaware.
 
High-resolution models
In their study, Jacobson and Archer adapted the three-dimensional, atmosphere-ocean-land computer model known as GATOR-GCMOM to calculate the theoretical maximum wind power potential on the planet, taking into account wind reduction by turbines. Their model assumed wind turbines could be installed anywhere and everywhere, without regard to societal, environmental, climatic or economic considerations.
 
The new paper contradicts two earlier studies that said wind potential falls far short of the aggressive goal because each turbine steals too much wind energy from other turbines, and that turbines introduce harmful climate consequences that would negate some of the positive aspects of renewable wind energy.
 
The new computer model provides a more sophisticated look than previously possible by separating winds in the atmosphere into hypothetical boxes stacked atop and beside one another. Each box has its own wind speed and weather. In their model, Jacobson and Archer exposed individual turbines to winds from several boxes at once, a degree of resolution earlier global models did not match.
"Modeling the climate consequences of wind turbines is complex science," said Jacobson. "This software allows that level of detail for the first time."
 
The researchers were able to calculate the exposure of each wind turbine in the model to winds that vary in space and time. Additionally, the model accounts for the wind that gets claimed by the turbines. It then calculates the effect of these wind speed changes on global temperatures, moisture, clouds and climate.
 
Potential aplenty
Among the most promising things the researchers learned is that there is a lot of potential in the wind – hundreds of terawatts. At some point, however, the return on building new turbines would plateau, reaching a level in which no additional energy could be extracted even with the installation of more turbines.
 
"Each turbine reduces the amount of energy available for others," Archer said. The reduction, however, becomes significant only when large numbers of turbines are installed, many more than would ever be needed.
 
"And that's the point that was very important for us to find," Archer said.
 
The researchers have dubbed this point the saturation wind power potential. The saturation potential, they say, is more than 250 terawatts if we could place an army of 100-meter-tall wind turbines across the entire land and water of planet Earth. Alternatively, if we placed them only on land (minus Antarctica) and along the coastal ocean, there is still some 80 terawatts available – about seven times the total power demand of all civilization. Hypothetical turbines operating in the jet streams 6 miles up in the atmosphere could extract as much as 380 terawatts.
 
"We're not saying, 'Put turbines everywhere,' but we have shown that there is no fundamental barrier to obtaining half or even several times the world's all-purpose power from wind by 2030. The potential is there, if we can build enough turbines," said Jacobson.
 
How many?
Knowing that the potential exists, the researchers turned their attention to how many turbines would be needed to meet half the world's power demand – about 5.75 terawatts – in a 2030 clean-energy economy. To get there, they explored various scenarios of what they call the fixed wind power potential – the maximum power that can be extracted using a specific number of wind turbines.
 
Archer and Jacobson showed that 4 million turbines, each operating at a height of 100 meters and producing 5 megawatts, could supply as much as 7.5 terawatts of power – well more than half the world's all-purpose power demand – without significant negative affect on the climate.
 
"To get there, however, we have a long way to go. Today, we have installed a little over 1 percent of the wind power needed," Jacobson said.
 
Jacobson and Archer would site half of the 4 million turbines over water. The remaining 2 million would require a little more than one-half of 1 percent of the Earth's land surface – about half the area of the state of Alaska. However, virtually none of this area would be used solely for wind, but could serve dual purposes such as open space, farmland, ranchland or wildlife preserve.
 
Rather than put all the turbines in a single location, Archer and Jacobson say it is best and most efficient to spread out wind farms in high-wind sites across the globe – the Gobi Desert, the American plains and the Sahara, for example.
 
"The careful siting of wind farms will minimize costs and the overall impacts of a global wind infrastructure on the environment," said Jacobson. "But, as these results suggest, the saturation of wind power availability will not limit a clean-energy economy."
 
Funding sources for this research include the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration High-End Computing Program.

Fine human beings of the next edge, please help me with cheap/free accommodation while I expand my startup, Green Breakfast Club, to new cities.  I'm looking for a place to stay from 10/30 - 11/4 in London, while launching Green Breakfast Club London on 11/2, and then I'm looking for a place to stay from 11/7 - 11/10 in Zurich, while moderating a green investing panel at the TBLI Conference.

The work I do with Green Breakfast Club is to provide a peer to peer resource exchange for green entrepreneurs to help eachother through resource sharing. While still in bootstrapping mode, I am expanding to new cities and opening up new chapters, but keeping the travel costs low. We've a dozen cities lined up for next year, and as it turns out, this first trip to London and Zurich is the only one where I don't have friends/sponsored/free accommodation...

Perhaps you can help or know a place to stay in either of these cities during these dates?

About me: http://www.daniellelanyard.com/
About Green Breakfast Club: http://www.greenbreakfastclub.com/ I love you all. Let there be no doubts. That would be you all and the branching edge style FB groups. I would like to publically apologize.

I did already post this on my personal page but please let me say again. I apologize for scaring everyone with my manic episode. There were a lot of reasons why it happened. Just let it be 'water under the bridge.'

I feel somewhat out of touch with this group now. I had used up all my energy and resources to their limits. Which was basically nothing. I tried to make it with nothing because I knew even I began to fail at some point, I would still have more than what I had. Which was in essence, nothing. Nothing, except for this. 

I'm not even being dramatic about it. I'm simply stating the cruel truth.

I was only seeking some agency. I was always aware of the need for responsibility. Every human has basic needs. In my case, few were being met. I did a lot of improvising. 

I've gained so many connections here and have up-skilled simply by paying attention.  

So basically what I am saying is that I would like to become involved with this community again. Please let me know how I might be able to help and be of service. 

There is no rush. Once again, I love you and RESPECT you all. Like everyone likes to tell me, as a closer, (remember) to have fun. 

That is all, see you around. Hello Nextedgers, what do you think of the next wave of innovation? I've been asked to provide some interpretation of a future for local entrepreneurship in northern Italy and I came up with this. Appreciate your feedbacks as the Transformational Enterprise is a key question for me (in understanding the transition) Anybody watching this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=6yy5wArfuIA Greetings all (and apologies in advance if this question has been asked/discussed before, I can't always keep on top of all discussions in groups), but does anyone have any good web links for designing an effective conference? My work is looking at reinventing a major national environment conference it hosts biannually (attended by govt and business mostly - I want that to change too!) from Powerpoint, speakers usual zzz and nothing happening after the event to something more like 'unconferencing' (although they are yet to be introduced to this word or know what it means, that is what they want!). We have Ed Bernacki here working with us, and his principles will inform the thinking, but what I'm really interested in is what practical examples you have used or experienced, what works to make an event more collaborative, participatory, useful, memorable and one that captures value for the people who go, long after its over? has potential: Best speech ever. W/English SUBT I asked two questions at a conference yesterday:

1. Do you think you have to change behaviour and way of thinking in order for the whole society to be sustainable? Why/why not?

2. What are the benefits/problems of increased cooperation in society with help of Internet and Communication Technology (ICT)?

I'd love to hear opinions/facts, anything from you guys here [preparing a blog post]. For all those wondering what Hunter's been up to lately:
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/477141142/mcivte I like these distinctions. Heading to NYC November 5-7. Who here is in NYC and which Next-Edge folk should I meet up with? :) My team (Pursuit) is building a platform / service to connect people at the right time for the right reasons. We do this by connecting people over their need and haves while aligning people based on their intentions. Our goal is to build a social asset map / semantic web of people to speed up innovation and collaboration.

Our MVP product is an introduction tool-Making it easy to introduce people across networks and platforms (GMail contact to Facebook Friend & LinkedIn Friend) without ever revealing any contact information. We help set context for the contacts you are introducing (or receiving) and make it easier to track the introductions success. 

Were working hard to improve this experience based on feedback, and would love to invite ANY Next Edger to participate by providing some information here: http://goo.gl/wEmEq

Our second product stage is group/community functionality. We want to empower groups of people to better collaborate (Next Edge is a great example). We will do this by making it easy to announce your intentions, requested needs, and display your haves (skills/experience). This helps when searching or discovering those in the group which best fit you at this moment. Were curious if this functionality is useful? What other sort of goal alignment and need/have pairing features would be helpful enough to use?

Your thoughts regarding groups is much appreciated here: http://goo.gl/YAvrL In deep gratitude for the support and encouragement you all gave me this summer during my sabbatical. Riffing off discussions here around the core vs the edge, this article makes a point about how heavily invested existing systems (here capital intensive physical machines) cast a shadow long into the future. Getting to the future means that we need to rethink our current investments.

The article takes, I think, a lot of the points that are discussed here and reflects them in a physical example. Yep, it's related to waste, but that's just a particular interest of mine. An even more common example is power plants - build a coal fired power plant, and you want to be firing it with coal for its useful life. Which is generally long.

Anyway, I thought it might be interesting to share for people who want to think about how the edge translates back into machines. Hi all! Great stuff happening in this group, and perhaps there are connections to be made with the project, curriculum, and website I've been developing for many years The below article describes the project. There's a short video too.
I am a Humanities teacher with a long-term interest in a website that links the news to volunteer reactions and provides context to users. This interest has led me to develop a curriculum and website that are now in use by 200 students in Montreal and New York, and the possibilities for expanding is just getting off the ground. 
If you teach courses that could benefit from cross-campus writing about the news and how to improve the world, I'd love to talk to you about the site, and the ways it appears to be growing. If you know somebody who might enjoy using the site, pass it on! It's appropriate for upper level High School, College and University students from a variety of disciplines.
Check out the article and send me any thoughts! I would love to find people who see directions for this to go and perhaps ways to help me in developing it upwards and outwards. Thanks!

1.

how many people know that the algorithm that led to Google’s success was funded by a public sector National Science Foundation grant? Or that molecular antibodies, which provided the foundation for biotechnology before venture capital moved into the sector, were discovered in public Medical Research Council (MRC) labs in the UK? Or that many of the most innovative young companies in the USA, including Apple, were funded not by private venture capital but by public funds, including the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme?

2.

between 1971 and 2006, 77 out of the most important 88 innovations (rated by R&D Magazine’s annual awards) were found to have been fully dependent on US federal government support, especially, but not only, in the early phases … in the pharmaceutical industry, it is state-funded research that has been responsible for producing 75 per cent of the most innovative drugs (‘new molecular entities’ with priority rating), with private pharma preferring to focus on the less risky, hence often more profitable, ‘me too’ drugs.
The state is absolutely crucial for guaranteeing business innovation, argues Mariana Mazzucato (excerpt): This is the crispest distillation of the first three levels of human being I have ever seen:

Masterful exposition

Deep respect "A community of imaginative citizens to detect and develop socially innovative projects" Check out the Social Me analysis... It's actually pretty interesting... I just learned something that makes me happy which is that it told me that 'Suresh says 'I' less that 85% of the people'... and 'Suresh says WE more that 97% of the people...' http://www.zeebly.com/s/123527/a96f9551386 Concerning my ongoing identification with Liz’s “frustration statement”, my son urged me to “stop wasting time over-thinking and just DO something  - ANYTHING! -- that I CAN do in my limited circumstances.” As that advice was churning in my mind, I ran into a woman. Lindy, two months ago who DID find something to do. So I investigated and decided to copy. Now I’m ready to share the idea with everyone.

Lindy, aspires to one day have her own charitable foundation (she has experience), but right now she is selling Arbonne products, which are body care products and supplements made by a company that aspires to use the safest ingredients possible. (So, no moral conflict!) She gives 100% of her profits to charity. 

She shared that she devotes about 20 hours a week to Arbonne and makes approximately $1000. per month. I think that’s pretty good, considering my husband’s charitable organization’s last endeavor netted about $3.00 per man-hour, and my other friend, who is in Rotary and a charitable organization for mentally disabled adults, told me they net approximately $ .38 per man-hour on each of those charities. Yes! 38 CENTS per hour!

So, friends, I am selling Arbonne products for charity. I will give 100% of profits to educational and environmental charities that focus on preservation and sustainability. And I will be working under someone who does the same. (Double bonus.)

I am a KaosPilot (creative leadership school in denmark) in my second year, currently being trained as a systemic process consultant, looking to practice my skills.
Examples for such development processes could be:
* Teamwork and Knowledge Management - how to unlock the learning between different departments/projects and to build team capacities
* Creativity and Innovation - designing a space for you to revisit, align and tailor new methods that enhance your approach and workflow
* Vision and Mission: How could vision and mission be implemented in daily work procedures throughout the organization?

Benjamin Brownell has been designing a simple, universal, open ontology system... https://www.facebook.com/groups/145538675490320/permalink/466870136690504/ I have begun to try and befriend reporters from Iran to tell them that I want peace. Next is everywhere else. Does anyone have any ideas. Hi all! I'm passing through Washington, DC, in route from NYC to Atlanta and I thought it would be great to meet up with any Next Edge folks in the area...

So I checked the collaborative Google Map linked below and the closest person I found was Mark Frazier, 134 miles SW of DC, in Dayton, VA. Then I saw the map only has about 60 entries despite there being over 2,600 of us!

Is there another map with more entries I'm missing? If not it would be great if we could all rally around getting this map filled out more thoroughly, yeah?

And if you're in/near DC tonight or tomorrow send me a message! :)

International standards are crucial to international development, and IEEE is part of the http://www.open-stand.org/ initiative, but the price of their standards in the areas of development e.g. that for Island electrical systems (http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1547.4-2011.html) is still a barrier. Interesting musings on the future of humanity by Bob Gower. Law of Two Feet for workplaces? From Michael Church's blog post: "Closed allocation and micromanagement provide an excuse for failure: I was on a shitty project with no upside. I was set up to fail. Open allocation blows that away: a person who has a low impact because he works on bad projects is making bad choices and has only himself to blame." Is there any open badging system that can recognize this – the skill of consistently asking the right kind of questions?

“Knowing something is probably an obsolete idea,” says Sugata Mitra, Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle
University. “You don’t actually need to know anything, you can find out at the point you need to know it. It’s the teacher’s job to point young minds towards the right kinds of questions. The teacher doesn’t need to give any answers, the answers are everywhere. And we know now from years of measurements, that learners who find the answers for themselves, retain it better than if they’re told the answer.”

Hi all. Been floating some ideas/concepts out there for my upcoming book with @BrendanHowley. Relationships are messy, and so this is a really messy idea: "Relationship Economics" (actually, it's a really messy version of a preexisting idea...). Your thoughts are welcome and appreciated.

http://www.wwtid.com/2012/10/17/relationship-economics-a-shiny-busy-graphic-eat-it-for-breakfast-or-for-lunch/ I'm looking for historical references for the origins of taxes. Not what the money was used for, but who thought up taxes? What is the origin of these payments we make? Is it payment for permission? Is it arbitrary "because I'm the king and I say so?" Anyone got a citation / link to answer "Where did taxes originate / by whom?" Thx all. Immersed in irrelevance? Innovation is insurance. 

http://www.mixprize.org/m-prize/innovating-innovation Michelle Holliday: "So how do we get to that magical place of co-liberation – where I’m fully engaged and so are you, and together we’re working toward some shared goal that takes on a life of its own?  In essence, it’s one big negotiation of boundaries.  The boundaries of my interests and energy versus yours versus the needs of our collective project.  And this is where the whole concept usually falls apart.  Because negotiating boundaries is really hard." 

(I was at the meeting. Was fun!) Hey any Hackers around?

Thanks to Michel Bauwens I don't really like the word "personal development" but I'm fascinated with how it could be of huge strategic importance to companies: Just heard about this via someone in the StartingBloc network.

6-Month Fellowship Opportunity for Social Enterprise Management in Emerging Markets - Deadline approaching! 

Jointly developed and managed by the Monterey Institute, Sanghata Global, and Village Capital, the Frontier Market Scouts (FMS) program turns compassionate and capable young professionals into talent scouts and investment managers serving local entrepreneurs and social-minded investors in low-income and capital-weak regions of the world.

The Scouts’ mission is to enable the enterprising poor to scale poverty alleviation solutions in capital-weak areas of emerging markets, while gaining career defining and life changing experience.

The Frontier Market Scouts Fellowship in Social Enterprise and Impact Investment Management is awarding 30 fellowship positions for Spring/Summer 2013.  Opportunities are available in 20+ countries with organizations like Village Capital, the Shell Foundation, and Invested Development.

Their own control and aggregation of information, preferably through human mediation, should provide information not only relevant to their learning, but also slightly unexpected. We will highlight why this serendipity is important in a learning context and also take three emerging technologies under the loupe; recommenders, RSS and micro-bloggers, and their effectiveness in supporting serendipitous learning on open online networks. Building upon a review of current literature, this paper posits that the deep knowledge work and the strong social networks inherent in knowledge building environments would provide the ideal platform for fostering serendipitous insights. It is further suggested that tools to deliver potentially serendipitous content would be of value to knowledge building activities. The next edge in Israel and Iran:

I want to create a page called The Absurdity Index which counts the daily instances of ""I thought it was The Onion" over time.... Why not crowdsource an app for an online global timebank that focuses on supporting sustainable development?

22 years ago, Apple released the Mac Classic.  It was a thousand dollar desktop that had the standard 256kb RAM and online capabilities of that time - a digital telegraph - and of course it did it very well, as did other higher-end Apple products.  But this one provided Apple's desktop publishing tools for the home at an accesible price (maybe a few thousand in todays dollar).  If you don't remember those days, imagine suddenly having the ability to spin out copy like the best print shop - the ability to look like a top publishing house when that was still a pretty exclusive club.  We can trace empowerment online from this using a bell curve.  In my case I took realtime info from activists in the rainforest off that telegraph to supplement a print newsletter that quietly changed the world a little bit, which is another story and just one example.  That was the beginning, and that Mac was one of the better tools that was there then, that gave people the voice that led to the Arab Spring. Now we are accelerating towards the bottom of that particular wave.

What we have now is analogous to a world where anybody with access to the keys and the ability to work them gets their own car.  And all the unqualified drivers are on the overcrowded roads with everybody else, accelerating towards the the right-hand terminal point of that bell curve, with little chance of a long tail.

I think where we are now online is that hundreds of millions of people are still trying to capture the power of those early tools, but it is gone forever - the opportunity to be ahead of that curve.  I see that as the old edge, with the new  edge the dream of consensus, as if we can somehow get all these people who are trying to win the Indi to line up and everything will suddenly work. And the next edge is collaboration.

Crowdsourcing is an example of the emerging power of online collaboration.  It's still young - filled with people who think that its power lies in being first or in using it to achieve consensus, especially through using tools like facebook to gather for oneself the power of some multitude for personal gain.  And with a hundred million playing at that, the statistically insignificant number of success stories is a large enough integer to keep people fantasizing, enough that the real power of collaboration is still a high wire act, with lots of gasps from below.  Wikipedia was early on board.  We've all seen their act and the touting of its amazing power per se is now lost in the dust bin of pop culture.  But Duolingo is doing the same thing, one of many, and the crowd is still on its feet for that - having just finished applauding and now rushing to catch that wave, trampling all over each other to be the next first. Too bad for the champion surfers, when if you have hair you can shave it off and look like a guru just because there are so many acolytes scrambling to climb in bed with the next powerbroker.

The next edge of the next edge, imo, is "the online global timebank" as a way to crowdsource p-2-p.  You don't need to agree with me on the path to here from there to get the idea.  You might think I'm overstating the potential, and you might have some valuable insights that you won't share because you think it's still about being first.  But what it's about, colleagues, is a way for people to help each other, p2p, while equally helping themselves.  That is the power of genuine community - intradependent economy - the necessary and missing opposite to balance the global pyramid that intrinsically supports the wealth gap.  Instead of giving a little, and giving a little and giving a little, into the black hole of need, you now can serve a little and bank your time in acommon pool from which you can withdraw service.

I have a crowdfunding campaign that is currently looking for 1000 people to contribute $10,000 to create a global timebank that intrinsically supports sustainable local development. http://indiegogo.com/reconomy. I'd like to this as a member-owned-operated network, independent from others.  A kind of craigslist for services that build resilient community, where you pay forward with your time to help others and simultaneously bank the time.  Except, unlike craigslist, this one is owned by the users, who gain membership by paying forward to help some person, anywhere online, to build their sustainable local enterprise.  The payer might help someone learn to pick a guitar like a New Orleans bluesman.  Or help someone walk like an Egyptian, sing like an Italian, twirl like a Sufi, speak like a Jamaican, cook like a Frenchman, engineer like a German, or simply trade your priceless time online for the same amount of time for daycare for your kids from down the street in your own neighborhood.  Genuine local community is the place where all our greatest wealth resides.  Now we can hook up, have sex with these ideas, and produce a world filled with sustainable, unique communities.

This particular global timebank is aimed at supporting local marketplaces that use their own money.  The members would make the rules, of course, and it becomes what they male it. But it begins by supporting a pilot in India that pays people with local money to pedal generators that mostly function to replace kerosene lamps with LEDS.  And this little people-power station discounts the electricity when purchased with the local money, aiming to build a genuine local marketplace that grows into a world filled with genuine local marketplaces.  This is an example of the kind of thing that a global timebank could make happen - supplying the skills it takes for thousands of poor people to become part of one sustainable local marketplace.  And no doubt those people in that village have a lot to teach the world also, especially as a template for that energy-money system.

But this doesn't have to happen as an independent network, and it's inevitable that we'll see an app on facebook for a global timebank soon - a way for everyone to afford to share in the effort to build a sustainable world.  Mark Frazier got this at once - one of the people interested enough in this "reconomy" idea to join our new group - and he suggested that I post about it here, and he took the initiative to be its first entrepreneur by yesterday offering here in a discussion on this group to exchange his expert services for a spec on that app.

So why not crowdsource that app? we are celebrating garage inventors today! Dont miss it TEDx Embarcadero:

What would you like me to do for you? Be specific and concrete. I'm going to plant a bit of a seed,primarily for myself, for the weekend and perhaps longer. That seed is "How do we get disruptive change in fields dominated by infrastructure thinking?" Infrastructure thinking is focused on measuring, forecasting, planning etc. My thinking is that this infrastructure thinking won't create the change we need, and that the change will only happen through some sort of emergence. My challenge (and question) is, in fields where infrastructure thinking dominates, how do you create the seething bed of ideas from which something radical can emerge? Good question: http://www.ted.com/conversations/4937/does_humility_have_value.html Recently had the opportunity to see "Connected" - a highly stylized and richly woven film by Tiffany Shlain which explores the visible and invisible connections linking major issues -the environment, consumption, population growth, technology, human rights, the global economy.

I guess I'm in the mood to discuss books lately. So, another one: Have any of you read http://www.librarything.com/work/148548 ?

See also http://www.2think.org/triplehelix.shtml

This book is important for me because it shows how complex systems concepts play out real -world systems (in this case, biological systems). It also helps the reader re-frame understanding about evolution and biology by waking you through the factors that lead to the *co-evolution* of gene, organism, environment. 

No one part of the "system" is the "mechanism". Nor is any subset of parts a collection of "mechanisms" that power the "system". Instead, the *system* (wherever you draw your perceptive boundaries around it) as a whole, living and breathing and doing, is the "mechanism" (until you start to understand ever - greater scales of complexity, then you are just looking at a part again, and the cycle of understanding continues).

The further the development of my new initiative - The Essential Transformation - I went to a special fundraising dinner last night in NYC where Pres. Bill Clinton was the guest of honor. Senator Chuck Schumer was a surprise guest as well.  Here's my report of what happened:

Senator Chuck Schumer met with us first. He was my Congressman in the early 1990's at which time he wrote some letters of introduction for me, so I could meet some people in Washington. During the Q&A, I mentioned that he helped me meet the executive director of President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development, and he remembered this. I then said I thought the work of that council should be offered to Pres. Obama to help him plan his 2nd term agenda. Senator Schumer said he'd "dust off" the council's report and see what he could do. I exchanged business cards with his assistant, so I could follow up.

During the photo op, President Clinton said it was okay for me to submit the ideas I had promised to send him 2 years ago, after I reminded him of our first meeting. I exchanged business cards with his assistant too.

During the dinner Q&A with Pres. Clinton, the questions were going in the direction of what information the voters were basing their decisions on. I'm worried about what the American people learn from the media in general all year long. So, when I got to ask a question, I mentioned this concern and gave as an example that I know Pres. Clinton was involved - with a project with leading sustainable scientist Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute - to retrofit The Empire State Building so it now uses 30 percent less energy. I said that even though they held a press conference about this project, it never got any significant coverage in the media. Pres. Clinton was delighted that I knew about this and enthusiastically reported how much good that project had done. 

While Pres. Clinton told us his main reason for talking to us was to report to Pres. Obama tomorrow what advice we had for the time up until election day, I could tell he liked where I was coming from. And he told us that the new film about Pres. Abraham Lincoln that Stephen Spielberg has made is something he knows will help people better understand what Lincoln's life was like after he was reelected... both entertainment and history lesson. This ties into my plans to use edutainment in my work.

Also, at the beginning of the evening I had a conversation with the couple who hosted the evening in their Upper East Side townhouse. He's a very wealthy hedge fund manager. I'm not sure about her career. But when I told him a bit about my work and asked him to check out my new web site, he said he'd take a look. I confirmed this at the end of the night. Seemed like a real nice couple. I'll get their contact info from the event organizer, so I can follow up.

And so, the adventure continues... Some people have the power to change the world.

New investments in renewable energy and fuels reached $257 billion worldwide last year, with India logging the sharpest surge and China attracting the largest amount at $52.2 billion.

In 2010, the total global investment in renewable power and fuel was $220 billion.

Investment in India grew 62%, the highest growth rate for any single country over 2010.

The total renewable energy investments in industrial countries in 2011 accounted for 65% of global investment, increasing 21% to $168 billion.

In contrast, 35% of global new investment that went to developing countries increased 10% to $89 billion.

Of this sum, China, India, and Brazil accounted for $71 billion in total investment.

Major development in 2011 was the dominance of solar power in technology-specific investments -- driven by a 50% reduction in price over the year -- with $147.4 billion invested in solar, compared with $83.8 billion for wind projects and $10.6 billion for biomass and waste-to-energy technology.Although this was not the first time solar surpassed wind in total investment, it was the first time that this involved such a wide margin.

Biofuels, which as recently as 2006 held the second overall ranking in renewable energy technologies, attracted the fourth highest total investment in 2011 at $6.8 billion, followed by $5.8 billion for small hydro and $2.9 billion for geothermal installations.

Marine energy technologies received only $200 million as they have not yet been commercially deployed.

China attracted $52.2 billion in new investments in 2011, the largest sum of any country.

This accounted for nearly 60% of the total new investments in developing countries and more than 20% of the global total.In terms of the pace of growth, however, the United States scored an impressive 57% growth in investment over 2010 levels, outpacing all countries except India's 62%.

Overall, the United States ranks second in total national renewable energy investment at $50.8 billion, followed by Germany at $31 billion.

There is no doubt that future of Energy would be homogeneous mix of Renewable and Conventional Fossil Fuels.

Today all major Renewable Technologies are viable and we need Government policies for their fast implementation.

Government should stop complete subsidies on Fossil Fuels and instead give subsidy to Renewable Energy sources. Join us @ ECONOLOGICS - Incisive Knowledge Converged!

And, as a follow up question, have you figured out what technology wants? Interesting... Design is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for success. The nature of design, emergence and innovation to understand their interrelationships and interdependencies is examined. We propose that design must harness the process of emergence; for it is only through the bottom-up and massively iterative unfolding of emergence that new and improved results are successfully refined.

My questions: if we design for emergence, are we for serendipity? ... and for social creativity and innovation environments to flourish? ... is it the task of leadership for emergence? Yours takes? A friend asked: “Are we possibly in a 'now or never' moment?”

In just a few years, the human population will have tripled in my lifetime alone. Extraction and rearrangement of materials has increased, too, and disproportionately (faster than population). Although vaguely intended, none of it was coordinated or paced. Those who have the most to lose are likely to protect themselves and what they possess with more and more controlling and lasting measures.

"[S]trong institutions of democracy and equitable cooperation soon enough" do not seem possible in the popular global sense. If we can relocalize our lives soon enough, I think our chances improve.

I am looking for people who are willing to engage with others, not at front doors and not for just a few minutes, to serve the voluntary redirection and renewal of lives in locales. For the willing, I've developed an instrument/toolkit. Maybe you can turn it into a profession. Inquire! Today TPM did a real world transaction from Stockholm Sweden to Nairobi Kenya. The test was aimed to see how long time it takes doing the transaction from cash to cash.

The result was incredible!
We have had a vision to provide cash to cash within 15 minutes worldwide and now we know that this is a reality.

Thompson EnviroConclave 2012 http://inhabitat.com/german-scientists-double-the-efficiency-of-black-silicon-for-use-in-solar-cells/ I am tired of this 'glitch', which prevents from interacting with John Kelldon, would some people please help me/us out with this so we can get collaborating again? My new web site - TheEssentialTransformation.org - is LIVE!

http://theessentialtransformation.org/ for those in SF and free next Wednesday evening please do come along - much #gratitude to Valentine Giraud-Robben & Marc O'Brien Leadership models of the last century have been products of top-down, bureaucratic paradigms. These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadership—one that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. Cheryl Anderson Spensieri turned me on to this guide to health, environmental, and social impacts of products (after she reinvented the idea then found out that it had already been done). 

They have a mobile app you can use while shopping. It seems insanely comprehensive - haven't dug down on how did they got people to dutifully assess 100,000 products... I'm at least slightly skeptical. Thoughts? Hi Next Edgers, Today the Center for a New American Dream and I released a 5-minute cartoon about how the sharing economy can change our lives and communities. We'd love any help you can give to spread the word and share this! Thank you! Complexity science reframes leadership by focusing on the dynamic interactions between all individuals, explaining how those interactions can, under certain conditions, produce emergent outcomes. We develop a Leadership of Emergence using this approach, through an analysis of three empirical studies which document emergence in distinct contexts. I find it disturbing that this message gets more and more relevant over the years. What circumstances will lead to this poster becoming a relic? What environment will be conducive to once and for all putting this to bed? How do we take what we learn from deep thinking and reading and apply it to change?
(A great question posed by Adam Johnson (aka @Garbologie) from Perth, Western Australia) 17) Summary: People involved with the "sharing economy" or "collaborative consumption" 

Category: Business and Finance 

Email: query-2j3a@helpareporter.net 

Media Outlet: Anonymous

Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 17 October 

Query: 

I'm doing a story on the "sharing economy" (a.k.a.
"collaborative consumption") and am interested in talking to any
of the following people:

1. Heavy users of "shared services" such as Zipcar, RelayRides,
Airbnb, CouchSurfing, thredUP, Twice, or other similar services
(preference for those who use more than one, especially users of
peer-to-peer services, but not necessary). 

2. Academics or other experts who are studying the sharing
economy / collaborative consumption.

3. Innovators who have founded companies or apps based on the
idea of sharing / collaborative consumption. EU Countries are being threatened with trade war for not adapting GMOs...I take it you have heard about the petro dollar crumbling as Russia sell crude to the Chinese who have prepared the trade lines for the Yuan to become the first alternative to the dollar as the currency for oil trade since the 1970s...what I mean to assert is that the new mechanism of control is food, intellectual proprietization of our food sources. Monsanto is the multinational corporotacratic handle of the state based FDA, the debate is no longer about health and safety, or even IP, this is WAR!!! What is your next step towards doing something new?

Accept your habits, they have served you well, defininig your space of contentment.

Accept your dominant mode of thinking, it has served you well, defining who you believe you are, your
continuous identity.

Once you have fully accepted your habits and your thinking, the next step unfolds.

I watched the movie Invictus last week. Here's a quote that stood out for me; I wonder if it resonates with some of you?

Nelson Mandela: How do you inspire your team to do their best? 

Francois Pienaar: By example. I've always thought to lead by example, sir. 

Nelson Mandela: Well, that is right. That is exactly right. But how do we get them to be better than they think they CAN be? That is very difficult, I find. Inspiration, perhaps. How do we inspire ourselves to greatness when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us? The dynamics, politics, and richness of knowledge production in social movements and social activist contexts are often overlooked. This book contends that some of the most radical critiques and understandings about dominant ideologies and power structures, and visions of social change, have emerged from those spaces. It highlights linkages between such knowledge(s) and praxis/action, and illustrates tensions over whose knowledge and voice(s) are heard.

We need to create systems that allow hunches to come together and people to find, borrow and combine hunches just as the coffee houses at the time of enlightenment or the Parisian salons of the modernists were engines of creativity where ideas were mingled and swapped to create new forms...

Larry Victor wrote:

"I coin words, create acronyms, and give specific glossary meanings to common terms used in a specific discourse, so what I say next refers to me as well as to others. There are no "objective" definitions of terms: their usage evolves relative to other terms in clusters - and the comments here acknowledge this, but many other humans don't. Concepts gain their "meanings" and labels as components of conceptual schemes and metaphor frames - which have subtle differences for each person. We can never settle on a set of fixed definitions. With multi-media digital representations as icons/labels our "language" is entering a phase of rapid "galdee" [growth, adaptation, learning, development, evolution, emergence]. Terms have both conceptual and emotive dimensions; the latter often ignored. These meta issues re dialog, discourse, and languaging must always be in the background."

This is how he used it in situ:

"VECTOR TERMS
To illustrate the higher level of complexity to be considered in this proposal, three new terms will be coined. These are called here vector terms, as they represent the multi-dimensional aspect of the concepts labeled by each term. Vector terms are needed when one term (from a set of terms), elevated as a category label for the set, creates a bias toward that term (concept), when the other terms (of the set) may be equally appropriate.
galdee = grow, adapt, learn, develop, evolve, emerge. Types of change.
reeee = relevant, effective, efficient, enjoyable, elegant. Ways of evaluating action.
seaf = support, enable, augment, facilitate. Modes for helping." Mind-blowing ideas. What do you all think of this? (Or is it off-topic for this group?) "Annual cost to protect species and habitats is less than half the amount spent on bankers' bonuses last year"

 - John Hagel, Deloitte Center of the Edge at TEDxBayArea Women

While advanced technology (ICT in particular) will continue to improve our lives, but at the same time the industry is continuing to face a collapse and sustained erosion of Return on Assets. John clearly identifies this as a global phenomena. This indicates a clear motivation and need to innovation, but at the same time there is no reward for those involved to remain the commitment in any respect.

So what John Hager suggests:
 
"The future of business belongs to the feminine archetype. Those that adopt the feminine archetype, male or female, are going to be the ones to create that wealth and enjoy the success of this new world." A business model based on the feminine archetype is about relationships, not transactions. According to Hagel, the masculine archetype that dominated 20th century business was strictly competitive, not collaborative, and a zero-sum game. The masculine projects a strong image at all costs. In contrast, the feminine allows for emotion, intuition, and vulnerability. Hagel says it is not possible to establish trust without allowing for this vulnerability. The result is greater knowledge flows and an environment where more people can participate. With this "big shift", our world becomes a smaller, more connected place--a global phenomenon for more wealth.

Note by ecoNVERGE: We fully underwrites this viewpoint and likes to extend to social, political and financial models as part of the New Socio-Poli-Economic model we are seeking!
John Hager clearly indicates that we need a fundamental shift in mindset related to competition and ownership of knowledge. The resolution is to participate in enriching knowledge flows with our own tacet knowledge through open but trusted environment, scaled to a massive scale.  The current masculing archetype does not enable such shift in knowledge sharing. Friends

The fear of open platform transparent posting..... or is this something else........I just had the previllege to add a friend who holds a degree from London School of Economics -  his comments surprised me why I was posting trillion dollar business projects on fecebook for discussion - his contention is that this is not a serious proposition if done on a social platform............ if I need to be taken seriously I should use some other platforms which he didnt mention............this is the problem of a hideous world all done under secrecy....... privacy......... securitising and hybridising trillions of dollars that never exists......manipulating trillions of dollars in Capital Market, Governments printing currency to bankrupt nations until the fraud cant be covered anymore because sovereign debt cant be hidden anymore plundering the assets in a cricular flow model without integrating environment.....is this what we wish to adopt for the new sustainable model called the social capital bundling.........I need to see your responses please free to pour in your views.....would love to change myself.

Many of you know I've been writing a lot lately. Much of that has been an effort to clarify language re: Creating the Future. What exactly ARE we? What is our theory of change? What are we intending to accomplish and how?

As we are about to seek scale-up funding, at minimum we need to be able to clearly and succinctly answer those questions!

We have assembled our thinking into a first attempt at an infographic, to begin to tell that story. And we REALLY need your thoughts, most importantly (per the questions at the post), from that infographic, what do YOU think we do?

Please click through, look at the graphic, and help us be as clear as we can. Thank you!!!! THIS! Considering Abhay Pattnaik's Rain Forest Capital - as he has asked help in advancing his Sustainable Leadership model.  I thought a dedicated thread would be of use, allowing more focus.  I have reviewed a good portion of what he offers as a starting point, a 65 page document.  My first reaction is - give me a one pager.  Better, give me the elevator pitch.  It is useful to have these level of communications as starting point.  I also recommend, looking at this conversation as an example ... that as I see NE as a "space between" many projects/people/efforts/ideas... that most ideas that want to advance themselves will do well to establish a social container.  NE isnt really the social container for particular projects, but it is a great place to invite trial by fire or more supportive nurturing.

Thnx Richard Adler The Next Edge map to date.
Sorry for the stereo type, girls are pink and boys are blue in the map. This is a sample of us last summer. Have we changed in our composition? A whole day of viewing probably but this is a "journey" to describe my thinking and it's way for me to go back and reflect and then move forward - how would your own workshop look like?

http://sharedtracks.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/motivation-driven-development-ii-online-workshop/ http://economics4humanity.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/keeping-silent-for-the-greater-good/ http://inhabitat.com/german-scientists-double-the-efficiency-of-black-silicon-for-use-in-solar-cells/ Any other next edgers attending this conference by chance? Event of interest October 27 in Vancouver, and an online version, too. Hi, everyone. A few moments ago Glistening Deepwater was even asking people to help define it would seem the terms "Sustainability" and "Resilience". In the name of defining things, I have a few questions of my own I'd like to ask. I'm not sure how to pose these questions so I will try to be brief, but I warn you there are numerous concepts and questions floating around in my head.

1) In The Next Edge, I have noticed have noticed countless threads on topics such as the Tragedy of the Commons (the Commons in general), the Principal-Agent Problem, Optimal Decision-Making (in Groups), Systems Thinking, and so on. I have read such great comments on hard problems in network theory, with regard to complex adaptive systems, and so on.

2) Lately, there has been talk of 'Collaboration', or what we could call 'Efficient Group Collaboration'. I have also read much about different institutional and organizational structures, moving away from the 'centralized' towards more 'horizontal' structures. There has been talk of deliberative democracy, i.e. Deliberative Polling and so on.

3) There has been much talk about sustainability, viability, resilience, etc. of organizational structures.. an 'ecological', 'systems' take on management, one could say, or consensus decision-making.

4) I am concerned with something specific and would like the Theorists amongst The Next Edge to chime in. I want to take a specific, concrete example and apply cutting-edge game theory etc. to it. I want to see what the best minds of The Next Edge have to say about this concrete example.

5) The example is Petty Corruption or Incidental Corruption, let's say within the confines of a Democracy.. so a form of bureaucratic and political corruption, but more than that, what seems to be a fundamental problem in almost all systems of Governance worldwide.

6) We have talked about the free-rider problem, about the principal-agent problem, about social dilemmas and social traps.. we have talked about strategic interaction, about human behavior in groups, about stigmergy in social insects.. I would like to know what factors encourage systemic corruption, decentralized vs. centralized systemic corruption, and petty or incidental corruption, political corruption.. I don't want to cast the net too widely and cover "all forms of corruption generally".. I want to take a specific example, but at the same time I'd like to ask a simple question:

What is Corruption? How can we characterize 'corrupt behavior' in general and in particular? Once we have done that, then we can look at Incentives (conflicting incentives), Conflicting Interests, and the failure of an organization or process, lack of transparency, culture of impunity, etc.

Many organizations are doing anti-corruption research at the moment, the world over. It appears that Open Data and Transparency are key tools in solving the problem. I therefore want to ask: In game-theoretic terms, how can we efficiently model a Corruption Game? What about agents' Risk Attitudes, Beliefs, and Information in the Corruption Game? what is the influence of risk attitudes, beliefs, and information in the behavioral choices of agents in a Corruption Game? Is it as simple as selfishness and a free-rider problem? or is it more complex, a principal-agent problem? How do 'corrupt behaviors' propagate through a network and how can we model that? In other words, how does corruption 'flow' and how can we control that flow, maybe even mitigate it, stop it, etc.?

Lastly, how should we characterize the 'Corruption Game' itself? What category of game is it? What are the stakes, who are the stakeholders, what are the individual and collective costs and payoffs? Can we model it as an evolutionary system? What would the fitness function be? How can we relate the Corruption Game to the seemingly paradoxical nature of consensus decision-making in democratic institutions? How does democracy fail to solve real-world problems in a timely manner? What breaks down, what are the breaking points of the democratic decision-making process? How can we improve it? How can we eradicate corruption? In other words, it is a mechanism design question.. How do we design a political system where corruption is non-existent or maybe even impossible? How can we design a political system where decision-making is swift and efficacious? What factors are at play, what processes? What is it we aren't seeing?

Please throw your best systemic thinking to the question.. or non-systemic. You may choose to take a thermodynamic approach, a systems approach, any approach you want. I'm curious to know how we can model and characterize the Corruption Game, by playing with incentives, costs, payoffs, microeconomics, behavioral economics, behaviorism (schedules of reinforcement), information, beliefs, risk, transparency, accountability measures and so on.

An example of a possible solution in a democracy could be a simple as Voter Recall. In other words, if people are unhappy with an elected political party, they can vote for a Recall. A new election takes place immediately. One of the risks of this strategy however is that you can get instability in governance, where the elected party changes too often. Another solution could be to not have parties at all, moving closer to deliberative or direct democracy.. The Corruption Game could be endemic to representative democracies, we would have to look at that too.

The Bigger Picture though is not just to look at anti-corruption measures. I think that the Corruption Game can be a great source of insights and solutions for all sorts of problems, namely problems in efficient collaboration in groups and problems of adoption, like the paradox of the mainstream adoption (non-adoption) of energy-efficient technologies..

Anyway if you have read up to this point, I thank you kindly. I merely want to spark conversation. I know that there are many great minds here in The Next Edge, and I've seen you comment on these underlying topics and concepts before. I just thought since we seem to be hearing more and more about Corruption in the world, that the Corruption Game could serve as an interesting toy model to smash our brains against. Hope you are well. Take care and keep in touch. Sorry if someone has already posted this, but it is amazing and I only found out about the project today (via a print newspaper of all places!) http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/#!home Taxis are getting hugely disrupted in San Francisco with the rise of ridesharing apps like Sidecar.  Here's an account of a cabbie who switched from driving for taxis to driving for Sidecar to get more flexibility, safety, and pay:

And just this week, regulators have slapped a cease and desist order on Sidecar.  What do you think about this? Where do we start..?
http://sharedtracks.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/principles-for-sustainable-learning/ Dan Robles just posted this talk by Jerry Michalski as a comment to another thread, but I think it deserves its own thread. It's about what might happen if we trusted ourselves. https://www.facebook.com/elbefashion This my goddess is doing, thank you for appearing to me today in these lines by Leonhard Cohen (and I don't know why they make me weep):

"And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever." A small, but precious self-reflexive insight: I am coming to believe that my reputation within the Next Edge community is the most valuable asset that I have. Being 21 and a student with the predictable debt load (before I learned what was up, stopped borrowing money, and started taking a 'slow learning' and pay-as-you-go approach) it's not hard to beat my other assets, but in fact, I don't know WHAT kind of quantitative value you could put on my reputation because it has already led to two priceless life experiences which only hint at what is possible in the future with you all, and who knows how much what I've learned from you is 'worth'. The two experiences, both this year, I mentioned were an experience in London England with George Pór at 12 Commons-Based Economy seminars, and the whole Emerging Leader Lab experience in New York. Oh yeah, also one time I invited Jean Russell to come by my house in Waterloo for supper and we had a superb conversation. So partaking in this community really is an investment for me, and I've already felt like this community has invested in me. In the face of the wicked crises, I was thinking today about how investing in one another is truly the best thing we can do. I feel both a privilege and a sense of responsibility around being one of the youngest next edge members, in the sense that what I learn from you all is important because we're considering together how the positive ideas we discuss might get passed on to my generation and younger still. Within the next few years I hope to move into the very space of un schooling and learning facilitation that Jerry mentioned in his trust talk. I don't doubt that this network will come in handy when that time comes, and my reputation too :) Be well all, Connor THANK YOU, we´re amongst the winners of the german entrepreneurship competition.

Thank you - all together, we´re AWESOME ! Take a look here Glistening Deepwater -- I'd say the one term has been corrupted (and should mean "if you can keep doing it forever") and the other points more towards adaptability in the face of massive change. In my mind the best directional word is Thrive and the 'way there' is Nurture and the action glue is Design <3 I just looked through this Guidebook on Multistakeholder Process Facilitation and found it quite helpful.

The global pundit;s yet again have predicted the dooms day but have no guts to include environmental degradation cost which will bankrupt economies..........this is what IMF say's "Risks for a serious global slowdown are alarmingly high," said the IMF's World Economic Outlook report, which was released here Tuesday ahead of the fund's annual fall meeting. It was its bleakest assessment of global growth prospects since the 2009 recession.

    The fund expects the world economy to expand just 3.3% this year and 3.6% in 2013.

    This should be infact be interpreted as -3000% due to hybridisation manipulations and exploitation of the circular flow model........,where environment has not been integrated.......we are already dying........in ICU presently. Hey everyone! Would like to quickly introduce my best friends: Bryan Williamson and Brent Cooper both completed their advanced degrees at the London School of Economics while I was doing a year abroad there. Daniel Reyes is a long-time fellow music-maker, now works in the music industry in LA. These are my closest friends and, I am happy to report, recently (more or less) turned on to (and enthralled with) the shift of which we all aspire to be a part.

According to a new study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, getting food from the farm to our plates uses 10 percent of the U.S. energy budget, 50 percent of the nation’s land, and 80 percent of all the freshwater consumed in the U.S.  Yet, 40 percent of this food is discarded (a whopping 20 pounds plus per person each month), 97 percent of which ends up in landfills; this makes “food waste the single largest component of municipal solid waste reaching landfills and incinerators” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This is a huge waste of money for households and for cities and towns that must pay disposal fees. What’s more, it exacerbates global warming because when food buried in a landfill decomposes without exposure to air (anaerobic digestion) by asset_transfer (Asset Transfer Unit)

So how do we organize for that? Complex challenges demand complex solutions. By their very nature, these problems are difficult to define and are often the result of rigid social structures that effectively act as “traps”. However, resilience theory and the adaptive cycle can serve as a useful framework for understanding how humans may move beyond these traps and towards the social innovation that is required to address many complex problems. This paper explores the critical question of whether networks help facilitate innovations to bridge the seemingly insurmountable chasms of complex problems to create change across scales, thereby increasing resilience. For All Next Edgers: In a month, I'm keynoting an event for the Directors Guild of America about the future of media. What would you want me to tell them if you could? I'm very serious.

AoA Rehan bhai

If you know about any student of any university in Karachi who has developed some out of the
box innovative self sustainable (profitable) model which is also socially beneficial, who is also practically implementing it then please
share his or her contact info with me. I want to invite him / her to present the idea at Ejaad Lounge event at KIET on 13th Nov so that others can learn and get inspiration from them .... thanks perhaps the shift that has changed my life most radically is the moment where I stopped reacting to the experience of 

"oh, I really want to do / am inspired by / care about this thing... will you do it with me? ...no, you won't? oh..."  
with, "but I'm scared to be alone... ok, what are YOU doing? I guess I'll do that instead" 
to "oh well, it makes me sad to be alone, but I care about this enough to do it myself... I hope that eventually people see what I'm doing and feel excited and like they want to do it to...but I'll keep going either way."

and i'm so so grateful that after years of feeling pretty... lonely... that I'm finding the others that chose to go it alone if and when necessary, and welcoming those who are championing the fear that kept them away.
ups to the interwebs, a huge and necessary tool in this process.

namaste, tribe.
I love you. Remember KONY 2012 - Invisible Children's powerful, and controversial, video about Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, which reportedly became the most viral video in history?

http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/10/gar-alperovitz-systemic-crisis-politics-as-usual.html Introducing Ms Maryam Iftikhar a great Educationist from Pakistan, A lovely person to talk to , Do connect cc Mitra Ardron Luke Stanley Worries Over Defense Dept. Money for ‘Hackerspaces’ http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/us/worries-over-defense-dept-money-for-hackerspaces.html I've recently shared here a question about the real meaning of innovation (http://goo.gl/uY890). Is there any chance that the corporate, an entity that has transformed our present life and that most of us do not trust anymore, could still play a role in the (changemaking) game? People tend to like simplicity. In many instances, not possessing sufficient expertise on matters, they require it. They require easily manageable packages of knowledge, and these packages become taken for granted stocks of ‘common sense’ knowledge that enable them to cope, however faulty or misrepresented that ‘knowledge’ may be. Politicians and the media also recognise people’s need for simplicity. And here lies the problem, particularly in an increasingly complex and confusing world. And that is exactly what is required: banality and sneering that finds its ultimate expression in cynicism, apathy and acceptance of and adherence to the status quo. "In Los Angeles, where I lived at the time, mobile ownership rates had barely cracked twenty percent.  America was slow on the uptake to mobiles; by the time of my visit, Australia had already passed fifty percent.  When half of the population can be reached instantaneously and continuously, people begin to behave differently.  Our social patterns change.  My Sydneysider friends had crossed a conceptual divide into hyperconnectivity, while I was mired in an old, discrete and disconnected conception of human relationships.

We rarely recall how different things were before everyone carried a mobile.  The mobile has become such an essential part of our kit that on those rare occasions when we leave it at home or lose track of it, we feel a constant tug, like the phantom pain of a missing limb.  Although we are loath to admit it, we need our mobiles to bring order to our lives." Y'all might like to get involved with this (ht Larry Victor for the heads up) There's a fundamental shift in buying behavior and it is all about 'seeing and hearing', not touch and feel or response to advertising messages anymore.

http://www.banking4tomorrow.com/articles/gen-m-the-abandonment-of-touch-and-feel-and-the-emergence-of-see-and-hear A traveler came upon an old farmer hoeing in his field beside the road. Eager to rest his feet, the wanderer hailed the countryman, who seemed happy enough to straighten his back and talk for a moment.

"What sort of people live in the next town?" asked the stranger.

"What were the people like where you've come from?" replied the farmer, answering the question with another question.

"They were a bad lot. Troublemakers all, and lazy too. The most selfish people in the world, and not a one of them to be trusted. I'm happy to be leaving the scoundrels."

"Is that so?" replied the old farmer. "Well, I'm afraid that you'll find the same sort in the next town. 

Disappointed, the traveler trudged on his way, and the farmer returned to his work. 

Some time later another stranger, coming from the same direction, hailed the farmer, and they stopped to talk.

"What sort of people live in the next town?" he asked.

"What were the people like where you've come from?" replied the farmer once again.

"They were the best people in the world. Hard working, honest, and friendly. I'm sorry to be leaving them."

"Fear not," said the farmer. "You'll find the same sort in the next town."

(found here: http://www.quora.com/Survey-Questions/What-is-your-most-unshakeable-belief/answer/Stephanie-Vardavas/comment/1271976) Is social media the new opium of the masses? I feel like sometimes I am feeding a machine but doing no real good. It is argued that expert-based, hierarchical-instrumental policy making encounters insurmountable obstacles in modern liberal democracies. One of the root causes of this erosion of output legitimacy is the complexity of social systems. It is argued that participatory and deliberative models of governance are more effective in harnessing complexity because they increase interaction within systems and thereby system diversity and creativity. Make's me soooooooo happy to see a political party from Pakistan finally reaching out to Technology to empower them selves, I hope other's will follow the same around the world. !!!!! Freedom !!!! Dear Next Edgers,

I just wanted to take a "reading" of the "ambient temperature", as I like to say. I was thinking earlier of topics/themes I've seen lately in active threads in this group (I wanted to call them active trails, but don't want to confuse the probabilistically inclined):

-Complexity Theory/Science
-Network Theory/Science
-Systems Theory
-Collaboration
-Open Everything (Open Source, Open Knowledge, Open Learning, Open Collaboration, basically Open Everything)
-Trust
-Causes (social, political, economic, etc.)
-Sustainability/Sustainable Development, Green IT etc.
-Productivity, Productivity apps, Efficiency etc.
-Peer-to-Peer, P2P Everything, tech. etc.
-Non-monetary economies (intellectual capital, social capital, reputation economy, metacurrency, new currencies, the Value Game, the New Economy, etc.)
-Ecology ("Ecology Everything", from media ecology to communication ecology, "Everything is an Ecology")
-Swarm behavior, stigmergy, self-organization, optimization theory, eusociality etc.
-Documentation (of processes, of conversations, of collaborative learning process, etc.), GitHub-type "Collaborating like a Hacker"
-New Media/Digital Media/Digital Technology etc.

What else? Please review the list if you can and add what is missing. Thank you. (I apologize if someone already did this recently, I just thought this is what I've been reading about lately in this Facebook Group) Quick question: do you think we need a new directory of verified organizations working in Africa? If so, would you pay to be a part of it? Children see. Children do.
Peace & love to you all...

http://youtu.be/o2W7dbaxJZE Dear epochly human, multi-disciplinary, unusually empathetic, extremely creative people with aspirations to change the world who happen to hike, I am pleased to say that we have our next two hikes scheduled for October 5th and October 27th. 

Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and a social cadence for creativity. We will be hiking in San Francisco on Friday October 5th and on October 27th. 

For our October 5th hike please arrive by 5:15pm on Friday October 5th at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue San Francisco, CA 94121). It may start to get dark by the end of the hike so if you feel like it bring a flash light. 

We will then hike down to Eagle's Point and on to the Sutro Baths Cave before returning to the Legion of Honor. Here is the trail map, heading counter-clockwise from the Legion of Honor-- http://www.everytrail.com/guide/lands-end-san-francisco/map#poi-0.

After the Legion of Honor, those of you who wish to can join in for dinner. We will seek to go to the restaurant called Khan Toke if they can accommodate us as they did last time:Khan Toke- 5937 Geary Blvd http://www.yelp.com/biz/khan-toke-thai-house-san-francisco. As we won't know numbers, we may change the dinner location at end of hike when we call to confirm with how many folks we have. 

We will have a good hike. Please let us know if you will be joining so that we know to look out for you. 

You can join the google group for hiking info- http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level. 

We will also be hiking on October 27th. For this hike, we will meet at 3:45pm on the sidewalk overlooking the beach across from Beach Chalet next to Great Highway at the foot of Golden Gate park (https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=map+beach+chalet&fb=1&gl=us&hq=beach+chalet&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021%3A0x4a501367f076adff%2CSan+Francisco%2C+CA&cid=0%2C0%2C6303292318601808028&ei=QYhgUJChLcXUiwKS3oGQAw&ved=0CIcBEPwSMAM). The plan is to walk to the top of Golden Gate Park together and walk back. 

You can RSVP for either hike on its respective Facebook event page or you can do so by email:

What's wrong with that picture??? This paper aims to highlight the potentially political dimension of network analysis, namely as deﬁned in the social sciences, and of the notion of networks itself. It will be shown that a political project could, in this case, be built on the desire to know this reticular world better, but also to be able to act appropriately towards it. "I was born in Uruguay 38 years ago, exactly in the year 1973 when the military dictatorship began there. Some members of my paternal family were involved in the opposition movement (called the Tupamaros), so at that time my family diaspora began, some of them simply to save their lives (an uncle was not fortunate enough), and and others, like my father, because he suddenly lost his job and without the possibility of finding another .. so in the year 1976, my father, my mother, my little brother and me were in the middle of the jungle in Formosa, Argentina. That was a turning point, where my family ceased to belong to the middle class and began a journey of about 10 years, knowing the vulnerability associated with poverty across Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. One of the memories that I will never forget from those times, is of myself, a lively squirrel with the shape of a skinny kid of 10 years, selling cakes in the hot and dusty streets of Asunción to help with the household economy."

Would you rent your car to strangers? So I'm being asked for working models as an alternative to capitalism (which I consider slavery) where bills don't necessarily exist and people make contributions based on their passions and talents rather than the obligation to get a job and produce money  - Anyone have any? My thoughts have gone in this direction for the past month. This article says it better than I could. I would like to push apprenticeship as a complement to on-line education in the style of the Stanford AI Class by Thrun and Norvig.  
I'd like to ask the question: Could it be that between apprenticeship and on-line learning we might be able to close the majority of our schools?

With growing structural unemployment being brought on by continuing robotization and with an increasing near-future use of AI in white-collar jobs we'll have a surplus of skilled workers in all professions, not only in the crafts professions (where apprenticeships have been traditionally used) but in all professions. I'd like to see apprenticeships being used in places like software development, research, medicine, etc. outside academia.

We could start with an early semi-retirement so that anyone reaching the age of 50 would be allowed and expected to take on apprentices to share in their workload under their guidance. Remember when we thought we could own our identities through an independent third party open standard on the Internet and remember when we thought we could monetize our clickstream and companies would pay us for our attention and remember when we dialed-in to free-nets to access community information and become informed citizens and remember how Google and Facebook do all that now?  Remember that?  That was cool. “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds the most discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny'” ~ Isaac Asimov Welcome to TNE (the "other Facebook"),  Mary Sue Stevens -- and thanks to Kyra Kristof for inviting her in.

Just typed up an article on the role personal discipline can play within the greater cultural movement towards regeneration.  It asks each and all of us desiring change to actively experiment with our own lifestyles in an attempt to shift good intentions into active habits (through the formation of new neural pathways).  Discipline is at the heart of this process... 

What lifestyle modifications/practices have you consciously undertaken that have transferred into habits?   What lessons did you learn through that process? And how can we become more effective at bringing lifestyle change into the greater conversation?  Clearly what's being done now is highly ineffective... just in case you might like to join us!

The theme is Applied Discovery - using what we discover plus whole-brain creativity to develop our signature work and/or work offerings that are meaningful, alive and generative and/or facilitate that for others. http://www.bizcreativitysummit.com/.  15 diverse thought leaders, creators, authors, business innovators, practitioners, soulful entrepreneurs will explore discovery and various dimensions of whole-brain creative process (storytelling, improv, visual thinking, embodiment, etc) and their practical - and transformative - application in work and business. 

Includes dialogues with Next Edgers John Hagel, Michael Margolis, Annalie Killian and Frank Spencer, along with Dan Pink, Michael Gelb, Jennifer Lee and others committed to transforming the world of work. The format of the calls is part storytelling, part dialogue/interview, and part guided practice. If this resonates, hope you can join us. :-)

Global reach – glocal resolutions

http://www.facebook.com/groups/econologics/ A member of this group posed a question to me privately, and I share it here for thoughts. 

FB discussion groups (and especially ones like this one, where the goal is exploration and discovery) are great for finding people of like mind, and doing the dance of courtship, to determine who we would like to chat with off-list to see if there is a fit for perhaps doing something together at some future time.

However these groups tend to be a frustrating place for those who either have an urgent need for finding collaborative partners RIGHT NOW, or for those who are tired of talk and just want to DO something!

Is there a place online where people can find people who are looking for collaborative partners who are ready to rock and roll, less looking for "fit and relationship" and looking more mechanically for active partners now? "Resilient Communities"

argues for a link between pre-capitalist and post-capitalist practices An introduction to participatory and contributions-based peer production – Michel Bauwens http://t.co/vsXxuW7o "When Singapore gained independence in August of 1965, the challenges it faced were unanticipated, multifaceted, immediately threatening, and without precedent. How Singaporeans coped with these sudden challenges—resiliently and effectively—provides an important message for other cities and countries coping with the encroaching limits of a resource-constrained world. Disciplined land-use planning, practical policies that look after citizen well-being, and flexible economic approaches are some of the political responses that helped Singapore emerge, over 50 years, as one of last century’s great development stories. A review of the policies and programs that shaped Singapore’s postindependence point to the value of avoiding strict ideology when managing resource challenges. Singapore’s solutions should ultimately be viewed as tools or indicators that other cities need not borrow whole-cloth, but might usefully adapt to local contexts and limitations." How do you build the biggest encyclopaedia in the world? How Wikipedia works: What lessos can we learn and use? Rob Paterson's recent FASTforward post on corporations and cities and Kevin Jones’ comments on managing massive goodwill and building momentum vehicles that are larger than a single person’s genius got me thinking again about the kind of organization I would like to be a part of.

Simply put, I need to participate in something that nurtures my talent and makes me grow while contributing to a useful cause. Now, because the current chaotic environment makes it difficult to predict what initiatives will turn out to be useful, a combination of personal passion and personal risk-taking seem to be called for.

I personally believe chances of success are enhanced when you manage to have access to good advice, get very capable people, and find ways for them to gradually develop their skills and build confidence in themselves and in the team. Being part of a ‘Scenius’ (the collective form of genius) is a killer way to obtain these affordances.

A scenius is more like an ecosystem or a city than an organism or corporation. It can incubate projects and organizations, but is not really an organization. In this day and age, I suspect it can actually stay alive longer than most of the projects or organizations it generates.

I think I basically want to be part of a scenius, and I think this very group, The Next Edge, is a coherent scene that foreshadows the nature of an emerging ‘online scenius’. Some of the conditions outlined at http://www.quora.com/What-conditions-favor-the-emergence-of-scenius are already fulfilled here. 

However, I think our group is still missing a few key capabilities. Chief among them, in my book, is the ability to go beyond conversation and knowledge sharing and move into open collaboration.

I’d love it if a handful of us were able to get excited and playful about some simple Thing That Should Exist (e.g. ‘A Poignant Guide to the SocEnt Scene’), and efficiently mobilize our collective resources to just Get Them Done quickly.

Basically, we should go for hits. If we can pull off a few small capers, maybe we can challenge ourselves to pull off something more ambitious... you get my drift.

Engaging in small projects has many benefits. Some obvious ones are learning and getting to know potential collaborators better (both of which are sure shots, even if the project fails). Engaging in small projects that Just Could Get Big (Cause You Never Know) might be a way to conduct modest-risk experiments towards real impact.

So, to sum it up: given the diversity, collective knowledge and wisdom, and quality of engagement of people in this group, I don’t find it difficult to imagine that it could turn into a decent launchpad for promising initiatives, and I believe we should think a bit about this. What do you think? Where do you see yourself on this scale?

My point of departure is that there are ESSENTIAL components for inducing a Paradigm Shift from Status Quo to Disruptive Innovation. The roles are not mutually exclusive. By virtue of the way these peoples brains are 'wired' they will at different times play different roles. 

These roles are

1. Wayseer: VISIONARY with the capacity to sense the future direction of events and accurately predict the likely trajectory of a particular market. CATALYST for transformation.

2. Pathfinder: INVENTOR or INNOVATOR who conceptualises, develops and validates the effectiveness of a disruptive product that provides the right transformative SOLUTIONS to the ‘challenges’ postulated by the WAYSEER.

3. Trailblazer: Adventurous SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR who ‘gets it’ … identifies with the ‘CAUSE’ and senses the associated potential to benefit MANKIND and the PLANET. He perceives the potential viability and profitability of the new product … and develops a creative strategy to roll it out.

4. Activist: The Trailblazer needs Disciples … those TRUE BELIEVERS prepared to not only forcefully fight for the CAUSE and attract and draw in converts … but also to “put their MONEY where their mouth is” (by co-sponsoring the initiative via Crowdfunding campaign).

5. Maven: This will unlock our 'PRODUCT MAVENS’ (e.g. bloggers, social networkers). Highly respected characters in their specific field who become convinced by the potential of the product ... and are prepared to risk their own reputations by sharing their wisdom with a WIDER audience.

6. Connector: The Maven’s highly regarded and respected opinions attract the attention of the CONNECTORS who tweet, post or email the information to their vast 'opt-in' networks, opening up a GLOBAL market and precipitating a social epidemic.

7. Saleman: The Connector’s “magic” attracts like-minded and similarly motivated people in the Crowd who identify with the cause, appreciate the market potential and take the opportunities offered to be part of a global network of distributors and marketers. This is a great story about how you become obsolete with your experience in just ten years, the lesson is to keep on learning and adapting all the time!

http://www.indiegogo.com/exitstrata This article explores the difference between "game communities" and "play communities".  Useful distinction, as gamification grows into a popular buzzword - don't lose sight of the underlying goals of community and connection. 

"The rewards of participation in a game community are often highly tangible – statues and money even. Those for a play community are the experience of community itself, of affinity, membership, acceptance, mutuality, respect, appreciation.

...The sense in a play community…(is) so powerful that the community outlasts the game.”

http://defenderspoem.blogspot.ca/ Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
-Winston Churchill what you will find in the new p2p foundation report:

http://p2pfoundation.net/Synthetic_Overview_of_the_Collaborative_Economy

"Chapter One creates a frame of understanding with some general characteristics of the whole field. In order to do this, it attempts to create a general grammar to ease the understanding of the varied phenomena that will be discussed in the rest of the report. It tries to uncover the fundamental drives and explains the basic interconnected concepts. It ends with a first approach to a categorization of the different expressions of the collaborative economy. Chapter Two looks at user innovation dynamics, and describes how the corporate world has answered their challenge. We examine the emerging figures of the more active 'user' which replaces the traditional figure of the consumer, and sociological categories such as the professional amateur and the lead user. The chapter describes how corporations have adapted by initializing open innovation and by integrating practices for co-design and co-creation of value in their own value chains. We also look at the more independent user-generated media practices, which have been facilitated with the emergence of social media. In Chapter Three we look at two of the new 'diagonal' or 'hybrid' approaches. These hybrids combine entrepreneurship with more horizontal participation, and deepen of the mutualization of both skills and materials. In the case of crowdsourcing, firms appeal to the crowd for both creative/innovative input and for more service-oriented tasks; we try to make sense of this complex ecology. We also look at the emergence of collaborative consumption, in which physical resources and services are mutualized, in order to mobilize hitherto underutilized idle resources. Practices of mutualization characteristic to collaborative consumption also to render existing services more ecologically efficient, as for example in car sharing. We are witnessing here a more profound shift: from ownership to access: this is, access to a wide variety of services. We look at the new possibilities for (dis)intermediation that it generates, but also at the peer to peer marketplaces that it enables. In Chapter Four we look at the more radical community-centric production methods, i.e. the emergence of commons-based peer production, where participating firms have to adapt more stringently to the rules and norms of the initiating communities. After defining peer production, we look at the various ways in which community and corporate dynamics interpenetrate to create a 17dynamic field of hybrid economies. We also look at the cultural penetration of these new practices and the current shift of their reach from the more immaterial creation of knowledge and code, to actual physical production through the sharing of designs, as is emerging in the fields of open hardware and distributed manufacturing. In Chapter Five, we look at the infrastructural underpinnings which enable the new forms of distributed production. These range from the very material development of personal fabrication and 3D printing machines culminating in new possibilities for microfactories, but also distributed funding, new accounting and metric systems to measure distributed development, and new hybrid legal forms. These new hybrid legal forms integrate for-profit and non-profit motives, with more potential to generate contributing communities. Chapter Six is an overview of 'open' (i.e. based on shared intellectual property) and community-based business and monetization models. It answers the crucial question of financial sustainability in the absence of strong IP-based rent income." http://oblogdeeoblogda.me/2012/09/25/lesbian-couple-under-siege-flee-african-country/ If you can get to the 16 minute mark in this video, he starts to say some really useful things...especially about seeking out good ideas from wherever they might be.

Promoting a human rights approach to S&T advances will reinforce moves towards inclusive development. One direction has been the use of technology to provide evidence of human rights abuses.

http://www.david-bohm.net/dialogue/ fyi, for anyone in the Bay Area. this will be wonderful! "The corporate quest for scarce resources will become more rapacious, more violent. Arable land in Africa will continue to be grabbed to provide food and fuel to wealthier nations.  Drought and famine will continue to be used as a pretext to push genetically modified seeds, driving farmers further into debt. We will attempt to transcend peak oil and gas by using increasingly risky technologies to extract the last drops, turning ever larger swaths of our globe into sacrifice zones. We will fortress our borders and intervene in foreign conflicts over resources, or start those conflicts ourselves. ‘Free-market climate solutions’, as they are called, will be a magnet for speculation, fraud and crony capitalism, as we are already seeing with carbon trading and the use of forests as carbon offsets.  And as climate change begins to affect not just the poor but the wealthy as well, we will increasingly look for techno-fixes to turn down the temperature, with massive and unknowable risks … As the world warms, the reigning ideology that tells us it’s everyone for themselves, that victims deserve their fate, and that we can master nature, will take us to a very cold place indeed."

[RSVP]:http://www.eventbrite.com/s/aKKG Ok so I have a vision - I need some help making it happen. Any takers? :) The great lie is that the march of history represents 'progress... civilization... etc'... There is a prevailing assumption that we are more 'advanced' today than we were in the past. We certainly have more ability to 'control' or 'manipulate' our environment and in that sense we have more power, as a species, than at any time in history.

What constitutes 'advancement', however is not what our capacity is, but the wisdom with which we exercise our capacity. This is the sense in which we are failing miserably... This article explores the role of ‘critical mass’ and social networks in the generation of collective action. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative (social network) data, the article argues that both are pivotal in the process whereby collective action takes shape. The empirical focus of the article is student politics but it is argued that the mechanisms and dynamics identified have a much wider domain of application.

A temporary confusion out of thousands of people as yet somewhat unaligned is the perfect soil for renewal.

1. What smallest necessary concerted efforts towards setting things in motion?
2. Which local barnraising projects when tended to, would anchor, would validate we're on a path, taking however small yet significant steps?
3. What ongoing unlearning, realizations, realignments, out of which sharing of stories, insights, weavings, synthesis?
4. Augmented by which tools, frameworks, platforms?
5. Cocreating which new narratives, conducive to what shared and shareable understanding?

One of the most valuable insights for me, when inspired to think like an architect, particularly when combining with biomimicry patterns, is how it catalyzes a different frame of mind.

"These similar themes – one city bound by tradition, the other free from it; one emphasizing community and institutions, the other individualism – were reflected in newspaper headlines, and on the websites of hospitals and venture capital firms.

Not surprisingly, they were also reflected in the psychological tendencies of residents in both cities. In surveys conducted as part of this study, people in Boston were more likely to say they felt there were clear expectations for how people should behave in their city. Conversely, people in San Francisco said they felt where they lived that people had the freedom to go their own way. In Boston, peoples' self-satisfaction seemed to be tied to education, finances and community (all things that also matter to other people). In San Francisco this was less the case, with people less bound by concerns over status and social norms."

A few of the group members have already supported me - Jean Russell for instance - so if you have any interest in supporting - or if you'd just like to see what happens when a provocative Australian social agent gets dropped into the middle of these two events - please consider passing on the second cup of coffee and dropping $5 into the campaign.

I'm not entirely sure how to ask for support, so apologies if this is clumsy or inappropriate for the group ... I really just want to get to these two conferences so that I can help a hell of a lot more people.

In 22.5 hours (11pm Wed pacific time), I will be hosting training in "Collaborating Like a Hacker" -- that is, using github.com for collaborating on our most important IP.

This will be a "learning by doing" training session, not a discussion time.

Thanks to Helene Finidori and Glistening Deepwater especially, and all who have brought their enthusiasm and interest to this collaboration pathway.

I will post a link to the G+ hangout in the comments of this post a few minutes before we start.  

Background reading: 

* http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/What_if_We_Checked_the_Commons_into_Github/index.html
* http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/Collaboratory_Now/index.html My query for the day... how does the built environment of the developed world currently stand in relation to regenerative design principles? 

Understanding that we now rely upon 1.5 planets worth of resources each year (with demands projected to increase) and that being '100% less bad' does not account for prior impacts, regenerative design must become our new collective goal.

This is what I came up with... we have our work cut out for us my friends, but it will be an exciting journey ahead, eh? : ) Take an idea to the extreme! 

"How to Develop Your Own Creativity in a World of Conformity" ~ http://bit.ly/PVbvoF  by Steven Handel for only a short period of time this new doc is available to view for free on-line. I hope it isn't region blocked.
http://www.geneticroulettemovie.com/ "Society develops through a gradual increasing civilization, but at a certain point it needs to stop and give the individual the space to go through their own shadow." San Francisco Bay Area: it's almost here! for any Montrealers - from our friend Michelle Holliday - join her on Oct 5th... Could this lead to the CSR movement becoming proactive rather than reactive (as it mostly is now)? Hmmm... What might a Next Edge Talent Agent do, concretely, that would serve well some of us edglings? http://santacruz.patch.com/articles/optimal-health-nutrition-and-psychedelic-drugs Romney's comments perfectly illustrate what I call the "altruism dilemma"... likely a 'good man' within his circles but with a wildly inaccurate perspective on the world... which in a leader and a leadership class spells the end of an Enlightenment culture that respects and seeks to build a strong citizenry...

http://culturalengineer.blogspot.com/2012/02/issues-in-scaling-civilization-altruism.html A little bit of possibility to start the day (or end it, depending on where you are in the world...) Theme of the times I translated something I wrote i Swedish about unlearning and relearning - seems to me that's about leadership as well. Or today's absense of leadership - in fact.. excuse me now, but it seems we are all trained into idiocy.. luckily some of us survived - I struggle every day.
http://sharedtracks.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/to-learn-unlearn-relearn/ Found by way of Tom Atlee. cc Suresh This may not feel very Next Edgey at first, but I believe bearing witness to the horrors of what we're doing to the planet, allowing ourselves to experience and work through that grief, is an essential step in the process of social transformation we're all working toward. Nobody I've seen is doing this as powerfully as Seattle photographer Chris Jordan, with his photos and forthcoming documentary "Midway," about how ocean plastic pollution is killing the birds of Midway Atoll, at the center of the North Pacific Gyre (aka the Great Pacific Garbage Patch). Check out the photos in this WIRED piece, and see more at http://midwayjourney.com and the Midway Journey FB page. And I can't be shy about asserting (perhaps counter-intuitively) what I believe becomes a root of solution to this altruism dilemma... http://culturalengineer.blogspot.com/2012/09/on-tools-for-citizenship-neglected.html Best piece of writing I've seen on what drives so much right-wing thinking these days. Though I should add that privileged distress isn't inherently partisan - it's reactionary. The entire piece is well worth a read, but here's the summation:

"Once you grasp the concept of privileged distress, you’ll see it everywhere: the rich feel 'punished' by taxes; whites believe they are the real victims of racism; employers’ religious freedom is threatened when they can’t deny contraception to their employees; English-speakers resent bilingualism — it goes on and on.

"Confronting this distress is tricky, because neither acceptance nor rejection is quite right. The distress is usually very real, so rejecting it outright just marks you as closed-minded and unsympathetic. It never works to ask others for empathy without offering it back to them.

"At the same time, my straight-white-male sunburn can’t be allowed to compete on equal terms with your heart attack. To me, it may seem fair to flip a coin for the first available ambulance, but it really isn’t. Don’t try to tell me my burn doesn’t hurt, but don’t consent to the coin-flip." Hey folks - Global Integrity is kicking off a fund to help surface brand new ideas that target the challenges of transparency & accountability.

MBSR 8-week course INTRO Thursday @ The Happiness Institute 6:30-9pm - Cultivate Mindfulness and Ease

On Thursday, I am leading a no-obligation orientation for the next 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course. Come on by if you are curious about MBSR. Invite your family, friends & enemies (they surely would benefit).

http://www.stressreductionsf.com/san-francisco-orientation.html We are very keen to engage with social entrepreneurs and innovators in Asia or having experiences of Asia. Please help to identify ..never hesitate to present yourself if you are one :) ! My friend Bilal Ghalib has undertaken the project of engaging in the promotion of DIY-values, entrepreneurship, community and civic engagement, throughout the Middle East. 

After some successes in creating hackerspaces in Beirut and Cairo, he is undertaking his most ambitious project yet: to seed maker-culture in Baghdad.

Please support him on his Kickstarter project! He's got just 30 hours left to make his goal. (With some pretty awesome "perks" if you donate, too--)

"Imagine you are a young Iraqi student, just graduating college. Opportunities to work in the country are few, and working outside Iraq is difficult due to strict visa requirements. Your country still experiences violence weekly, while also facing many technical challenges characteristic of a developing country. You want to build the country, you want to share – but you feel isolated. You hear about a group of people who have an open space near the center of town where you can build almost anything. One day you decide to see what it’s about. There, you find others like you: looking at the world around them and thinking about how they can start creating solutions. They are creating open source medical devices, filling potholes in city roads, creating clean street initiatives, or making alternative energy products to fix the intermittent power issues of Baghdad. These are people taking initiative. They are looking to take ownership of their cities and build the change they want to see – serving their communities on the most direct level. At this open space, you have finally found a home to put your talents and energy to work. You’ve found a group you can trust, they are courageous, curious, and want to help you create a better future. You feel happy, you feel capable, you've found your people." someone asked me the other day: "so if you were CEO of the planet, what would be the first 3 things you'd do?"
without thinking long and hard, I said I need five: "1/. make it illegal to treat money as a commodity; 2/prioritize 21century education that is future, not past, informed; 3/. ban the entire weapon industry 4/. fund renewable energy and 5/. find the best designers in the world and say ok, now design the future, because, it's design that illustrates the links between all the silos" and then I added: actually, I'll just make sure THE NEXT EDGE thinkers and doers are well funded and networked
What would you add/distract?
(really, it was a shoot from the hip answer in a very informal setting and I'd like to ask you all, what would you have answered) Democracy in the Making is an unprecedented look at how ordinary people come together to change society. It gives a close-up look at the deliberations of activists on the left and right as they work for animal rights, an end to the drug trade in their neighborhood, same-sex marriage, global peace, and more. It shows how grassroots activism can provide an alternative to civic disengagement and a forum for envisioning how the world can be transformed. Beware the dangers of consulting thrivability!  I finally understand what David Holzmer writes about liminality and leadership. Liminality is the stage in a rite of passage when you're no longer what you used to be, but you haven't yet arrived at being something new.  It can be an uncomfortable place to be.  

I've noticed that more than one client over the past few years, at similar points in the process, has started reacting violently against what I'm advising, as if it's something terribly threatening. I took their responses quite personally, because often they were intended that way. And I wondered why I had such a talent for choosing psycho clients.  Now, I see that they were terrified of losing control, of letting go of the devil they knew.  So they attacked the messenger.  This concept of liminality helps me see that it might help to warn clients in advance that that stage will be uncomfortable. It reinforces my belief in the value of Communities of Practice, so they don't just have to take my word for it and can look to peers for reassurance.  Maybe we need to build in more coaching.  And certainly I can be more attuned to the fear behind the reactions. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences?  How have you handled them? My 100 Year StarShip symposium presentation slides, in which I outline a plan to transform humanity from a scarcity-based (you or me) to an abundance-based (you and me) cultural dynamic. This more mature level of existence is essential to free the human spirit (and the resources) needed to make fulfilling the 100YSS organization's mission possible. The Handbook of Internet Politics is concerned with theoretical and conceptual debates, political institutions and practices, and how the Internet creates new policy problems for liberal democratic and non liberal-democratic states, not to mention their roles in the global system. There has been a steady stream of high quality research literature in this field over the last five years and this Handbook calls upon contributions from some of the leading scholars in the field from the UK, Europe and US. and here's our first broadcast google hangout conversation -- three poets/thinkers/users of social media discuss how to catalyze community building and cocreation via documentation/transparent broadcast tools -->

ie: artists/writers/creative people MAKE with immediate valuation/product creation via algorithmic preprogramming/set up using social tools so as to focus on making-as-life-discipline 

conversation also goes into safety, transparency, community vs. need to engage in self-destructive behaviors... 

powerful stuff. we'll be doing more.

in the blog you have the link to the live broadcast as well as the notes from the co-created google doc with links, modelling/protocol notes, and intentions

It seemed to go down pretty well. There were some interesting developments in the development of the barter industry during the week as well. 

Jamaica is very supportive of development of complementary financial mechanisms, up to and including the Prime Minister.

Hey guys.

I've made a new post talking about movements driven by university students on Brazil / worldwide.

Isn't quite interesting to compare them and see if there are some similar stuff where you guys live ?

I truly believe on these movements as main drivers of innovation, entrepreneurial education and societal change ;)

Have an amazing week folks! "We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here, in the 12th century, invented the jury. Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power from government to citizens. Today we have the opportunity, and we have the imperative, to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions, thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury, the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance.

http://multitudeproject.blogspot.ca/2012/09/value-networks-about-commercializing.html Hello Next Edgers in San Francisco! If you are wondering what to do on Saturday October 6th, you might want to check out this event: http://www.meetup.com/Portals-to-the-Earths-Soul/events/80043142/ This is an excellent multi-media article on the evolution of fairness & inequality at the Keatley Creek archaeological site in British Columbia. 

Excerpt from the concluding section: "Brian Hayden’s phrase at the end of the last video—'the judgment of fairness'—captures an important implication of his theory. Whereas the norms of fairness among hunter-gatherers are common to all members of the group, in transegalitarian societies fairness is essentially an agreement among a sufficient number of the wealthy and well-connected, who are able to enforce their version of fairness on the society as a whole." (Bay Area)  Next Edge, yall are warmly welcome to join in:  Dear epochly human, multi-disciplinary, unusually empathetic, extremely creative people with aspirations to change the world who happen to hike, I am pleased to say that we have our next two hikes scheduled,

I'm excited that we've found a date & time when Howard Rheingold can join David Hodgson and me, Bobby Fishkin for a hike in Marin along with some other excellent humans. Our Marin hike will take place on Monday September 17th.  

The hike itself will begin at 5:00 from near the Mountain Home Inn 810 Panoramic Highway Mill Valley, CA 94941. 

David and Bobby will gather early from 3pm on with all who wish to gather early. We will meet at Cafe Del Soul in Mill Valley at 247 Shoreline Hwy (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-del-soul-mill-valley)/ (http://www.cafedelsoul.net). We can chat over a snack/bite/drinks. 

We'll be there until a little past 4:30 when we will carpool over to the Mount Home Inn and from there we will head on to the trail. We would recommend that people who are able to meet at Cafe Del Soul first do so because this will guarantee that you will be able to join the hike when it goes. Our Marin hikes leave almost on time. 

I'm also pleased to say that we've found a time when David Hodgson and I, Bobby Fishkin can join together with humanizing folks for a hike in San Francisco. Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and a social cadence for creativity. We will be hiking in San Francisco on Friday October 5th. 

For our San Francisco hike please arrive by 5:15pm on October 5th at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue  San Francisco, CA 94121). It may start to get dark by the end of the hike so if you feel like it bring a flash light. 

We will then hike down to Eagle's Point and on to the Sutro Baths Cave before returning to the Legion of Honor.  Here is the trail map, heading counter-clockwise from the Legion of Honor-- http://www.everytrail.com/guide/lands-end-san-francisco/map#poi-0.

After the Legion of Honor, those of you who wish to can join in for dinner. We will seek to go to the restaurant called Khan Toke if they can accommodate us as they did last time:Khan Toke- 5937 Geary Blvd   http://www.yelp.com/biz/khan-toke-thai-house-san-francisco. As we won't know numbers, we may change the dinner location at end of hike when we call to confirm with how many folks we have. 

We will have two good hikes. Please let us know if you will be joining so that we know to look out for you. 

You can join the google group for hiking info- http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level. 

You can RSVP for either hike on its respective Facebook event page or you can do so by email:

Warm regards,

-Bobby Hi, I have a personal need and I do not know how to come to it. I try to keep most of this to myself, but I have really reached bottom. I know most of you are extremely talented and smart, and I am hoping you can help me find some sollution. I am transsexual, which means I was born visibly in one gender (male) but I never felt I belonged in it. My whole life, I wanted dolls, to be in ballet, to get my ears pierced, to buy dresses, to be asked to prom by some nice guy. My parents left when I was 5 and I was raised in fostercare, bouncing from home to home, thru various abuses. At 18 I was released by the state, no education, no job, no skills, no family. I have been trying to find my way from that point. I am 30 now. Being transsexual is like being a statue, frozen, able to see the world but never affect it. Each day is one where my body rapes me. When I shower, or change my clothes, it's not something others can understand, it's painful and darkening. I transitioned three years ago and all my identification says female, but when I look into the mirror, I see my captor staring back at me. My children are 6, 5, and 2 and they go to the pool each day with my wife, they beg me to come with them, but I can not, I can not wear a bathing suit.  And the parents stare at me with anger in their eyes, I am an affront to the conservative muslim values of our complex, When I go to the doctor or the emergency room I am typically harassed. I was forced out of my job as a waitress on a military base after coming out as trans. I fought for two years thru 3 equal opportunity complaints to save my job. I can still remember one shift, when an officer looked straight at me and said "it puts the lotion on it's skin" with cruel mocking in his eyes, he kept repeating it until I ran from the room, and left my shift. I just want to be able to walk down the street without being attacked or yelled at, I want to take my children to a play group without other parents corralling their children away from mine as if my condition might affect them. The surgery I need is called SRS and FFS (Sexual Reassignment Surgery and Facial Feminization Surgery) Our insurance, Tricare, specifically lists transsexual care as excluded from coverage. the surgeries run from 20,000 to 50,000 dollars. If anyone know anyway I can get this surgery, it would make all the difference in life. I appreciate any help or suggestions that may come. Occupy is getting the message across in a creative and meaningful ways. Great article on the eve of OWS first year anniversary by Mary Beth Steisslinger

"With the OWS 1 yr anniversary upon us, i’ve been reflecting on how the world has changed because of these world-wide demonstrations of people power. People are fed up, and i love it. It’s so hopeful to finally see those getting reemed, fracked, ripped-off and dismissed standing up together. The world is taking notice"

http://thefutureofoccupy.org/2012/09/get-creative-get-serious-s17-plus/ in googling for 'noospheric playground' i came across this fascinating article (i read Songlines by Bruce Chatwin, 20 or so years ago, and have a feeling i should read it again)
"A song, for the Aborigine, is both a map and a direction finder. Knowing the song, enables a person to move across country, from sacred site to sacred site, on seemingly unmapped territory, through language-barriers, regardless of tribe or frontier. Those encountered on the songline nevertheless share the traveller's worldview (Dreaming). The traveller also has the responsibility to maintain the landscape by singing it into existence -- a fundamental act of creative aesthetics. Essentially the land first exists as a concept in the mind and is given form through the singing" What if Farmville (a game in FB) is real. How will its aggregate results compare with our agriculture output today. The answer will surprise you. Experiments with using art in teaching at a Danish primary school have made students considerably more engaged in class. The new way of teaching makes room for the students to be creative – while seeing the relevance of what they’re doing. A remarkable social experiment in education is happening in Kalamazoo, MI.  I can't wait to see what happens over the long term, because it's not simply the same as a country that has always had free tertiary education for its citizens.  This has aspirational qualities those models often lack.  What do you think? What conditions must be present when creating an environment that supports healthy systems for life to flourish?

What examples do you have?

This group has a flask as its icon, so here goes. One way to think about the idea of Relevant Domains ;-) Now for something more practical... We are organizing the largest anti-pipeline/tanker civil disobedience in Canadian History. This has to do with extracting oil from the Tar Sands, sending it through pipes across the country and shipping it to China... Interesting that Chinese corporate interests have funded most, if not all, of the $100 million environmental assessment process. Incidentally the Tar Sands extraction of bitumen is probably the most damaging environmental project in the world... or at least up there!

This is pure greed and represents the worst of human nature... conspiring to ignore public interest while running roughshod over 100+ first nations communities that have signed on in opposition...

So for we have 1090 people pledged in the last the three days! It's going to be epic!

From an IBM white paper David Witzel wrote to discover ideas that could help other large-scale, for-good technology projects succeed. We've been talking a lot of collaboration platforms lately. Master Curator Robin Good has published this great mind map of collab tools. Unfortunately, there is no review of them. 

Could you share your experiences of these tools and others that are not mentioned, and list some features that you would like to have and have not found yet. In particular I am interested in open ended collaboration, where structure and roles are not defined at the onset but need to emerge from the process. Dear Next Edgers, 

I am currently writing an academic paper at Aarhus University regarding the Steady State Economy and the transition to a sustainable economy. I am focusing my paper on Herman Daly's theories, and the role of marketing as an institution in this new paradigm of a sustainable economy. I am looking for sources that focuses on the role of marketing in a new economy and how it will change? 

Does anyone have any suggestions where to find theories in this regards? 

Thank you very much in advance. I will upload our final paper for you to read. "You must trust and believe in people or life becomes impossible.” -Anton Chekhov.

https://www.mindmeister.com/55395228/content-curation-tools-the-newsmaster-toolkit-by-robin-good-2012 Rise of the CyberHero - Empowerment & Social Activism Yep. That's about right. What do the Occupy, Los Indignados and Anti-acta movements have in common with social innovators? Bottom line, the function of the working class is to produce most of the goods and services for society, the function of the middle class is to train up, manage and maintain the working class in the interest of the owning class, and the function of the owning class is to own and control the entire operation. The functions of these classes are best carried out if the members learn the roles and accept them as part of our identity. A few examples might help.  If I’m brought up working class, I’m pushed toward low self-esteem and deference to teachers and bosses. If I’m brought up middle class, I’m nurtured for higher self-esteem, skills for fitting into larger and more ambiguous structures, and a preference for good manners and smooth interactions. I’m told that knowledge is the key and that knowing more gives me the right to manage, teach and judge others. Lifelong learning is therefore a value to me. This is a great post on mythology and positive/conscious media initiatives.

Around the world politics is in disrepute. It has become detached from society. This is a global problem, affecting western, post-communist and developing countries alike. 

We invite your participation in a new global politics which seeks: 

a. Representation of civil society in politics. 
b. Transfer of power from states and markets to civil society. 
c. Renewal of democracy by placing citizens and civil society at the centre. 

Our International Coordinating Council is at: http://www.civilsociety.org.au/CivilSocietyPolitics2.htm 

Civil Society Politics – Power to the People is: 

a. A movement - which individuals may join. 
b. Global in scope - civil society is global, and a new political movement is needed in every country. 
c. Open to members of existing parties and members of none, including those who seek new parties based on civil society politics. 

Our aim is to enable members in each country to network with each other and take initiatives as they see fit (including those who are members of the same political party, those who seek to form a new party or undertake electoral activity based on civil society politics). 

Civil Society Politics has 3 major advantages over other political change movements: 

1. It accepts the globalisation of culture, trade and people and aims to empower people and localities within it. It does not strive to build barriers of protection and isolation. 

2. It accepts a market economy with limited government and aims to empower civil society as the primary generator of cohesion, belonging, capital, ownership of assets, and public decision-making. 

3. In its focus on capturing power not for its own sake but for civil society, it has a built-in safeguard against extremism and the abuse of centralised power. 

Our International Council is developing several global initiatives to build this agenda. 

Our statement of purpose is at: http://www.civilsociety.org.au/CivilSocietyPolitics.htm 

Individuals and groups in every country are invited to participate in Civil Society Politics - Power to the People. There is no cost to join: http://www.civilsociety.org.au/civilsocietypolitics3.htm System change through people power: http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/system_change_through_people_power Seeds: A Microlending Game Where Farmville Meets Kiva http://t.co/9v52bKye RT @tillyjosephson Brilliant! #gamesforchange Interesting concept... http://alturl.com/hm9qi Creative Cultural Resistance is the broad use of arts, literature, and traditional practices to challenge or fight unjust or oppressive systems and/or power holders within the context of nonviolent actions, campaigns and movements.  At its core, cultural resistance is a way of reclaiming our humanity, and celebrating our work as individuals and communities. Cultural resistance tactics are particularly powerful because they serve multiple purposes. They inspire us to own our lives and invest in our communities, while building capacity for local leadership.  These creative and artistic tactics provide a fun way for people to get involved!

The same Sioux that started the Wounded Knee Siege of 1973 led by AIM, Russell Means, and other tribal leaders.

He's currently living in Palo Alto, CA as a Knight Foundation Fellow, and has done work with cowbird.com to make it easier for communities like the Oglala Sioux to tell their own stories. See:

Two campers are walking through the woods when a huge brown bear suddenly appears in the clearing about 50 feet in front of them. The bear sees the campers and begins to head toward them. The first guys drops his backpack, digs out a pair of sneakers, and frantically begins to put them on. The second guy says, "What are you doing? Sneakers won’t help you outrun that bear." "I don't need to outrun the bear," the first guy says. "I just need to outrun you." What one thing do you hope Next Edgers will accomplish in the next 5 years? "While earlier generations followed the rules and we sought to rebel against them, the Millennials want to change the rules beyond all recognition; to, for lack of a better term, cheat the system in order to make the world a better place."

We are now building a second prototype for our "value accounting system" an important component of the "value network" model (an example of commons-based peer production), which is developed by the www.SENSORICA.co community. 
We are now separating development of the value network model from sensing and sensemaking, which will remain the focus of SENSORICA. In other words, we want to move development of infrastructure outside of SENSORICA. SENSORICA will remain a value network, only focused on designing sensors and sense-making systems. 
So we are building a new home for the value network model. We want to use Wagn as an open and collaborative repository of information and knowledge about the model. Moreover, the value accounting system is going on github now.  
The value network model is about the p2p economy, which brakes away from the capitalist/socialist dichotomy. We would like to host the value network project outside of the "matrix", so to speak. We would like to deploy the value network infrastructure outside of the corporate infrastructure. In other words, we would like to seed the new economy in a place that makes it independent of the old system. 
Could you give us some advice? 
More concrete questions:  
Where should we host wagn? 
Where should we setup our value accounting system and other modules (reputation, role, feedback, project management, materials management, service, incentives and priorities...) that power the value network? How many of you who are U.S Citizens have received the "American Community Survey"? Thoughts? Wonderful talk about cities being the locus of progress on things which nation states cannot for many reasons - handle in any sufficient or coherent manner - compelling argument...

If you or anyone you know wants tickets, I'm selling mine for what I paid ages ago -- $39 for Philly, $124 for Boston.  Just ping me if you want either.  Or take them both for $150.  That's about half price compared to current ticket prices.

Mark Frazier Bunmi Oloruntoba has a blog post about the relevance of libraries to communities. Like many of his posts, he's curated some interesting links which provide a broad context for the subject.

Bunmi embedded two videos. In the first the architect David Adjaye of a new library in Washington D.C. explains his design to a 12 year old resident of the community. I'd love to see more videos use this technique of an expert explaining what they do to an ordinary person impacted by what you've done.

In the second video Hunter College Kate Parry talks about starting a rural library in Uganda. At first they thought of their library as a model. But found that at about the same time they built their library, many others were built in Uganda. The need then was obvious: to link these libraries together.

A must-reference document! http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/person-over-pee/2012/09/07 I have been playing with the relationships of flow/stock and nurturing/exploiting, and how we could probably express intentionality and goals of processes both in our discussions (leading to building The Platform and in the analysis and solutioning of our crisis at hand in terms of:

Nurturing the flow > To generate possibilities
Exploiting the flow > To harvest possibilities
Nurturing the stock > To grow potential
Exploiting the stock > To realize the potential > to nurture the flow

Our current system exploits the flow without nurturing it, and nurtures the stock without exploiting it, creating situations where flow (life blood etc, etc, etc...) is depleted and idle resources accumulated, diverted from generating possibilities. 

What Michel Bauwens describes as the artificial abundance of material resources and the artificial scarcity  of cultural and knowledge resources.

What other narrative could this help formulate? what we are witnessing right now might be termed a plutocratic insurgency:

"One of the most important global trends of the last few decades has been the tendency of wealthy elites to hole themselves up in walled off enclaves. These islands of elitism are designed to be largely self-sufficient in their ability to deliver health care, food, security, education, entertainment, etc. to their residents, even as they sit amid seas of social misery. (Mike Davis has spent a good portion of his career chronicling this sort of thing, starting in Los Angeles with City of Quartz, and examining it as a global phenomenon in collections like Dead Cities and Evil Paradises.)  From the point of view of the denizens of such communities, the primary function of the wider society is to serve as a source of cheap, servile labor, and as a well of resources to be looted. Gated communities, in turn, are merely an example of a broader pattern, in which economic, social, or political enclaves are carved out of a national state and enabled to play by a fundamentally different set of rules from the surrounding territory.

In themselves the creation of such enclaves do not amount to a plutocratic insurgency. Rather, plutocratic insurgency arises wherever you see financial and economic elites using such enclaves as staging areas for making war on public goods. This is what I take to be the defining political-economic feature of plutocratic insurgency: the attempt on the part of the rich to defund the provisioning of public goods, in order to defang a state which they see as a threat to their prerogatives. (Conceptually, plutocratic insurgencies thus need to be separated from kleptocracies—the latter involve the using the institutions of state to loot the population, whereas the former wish to neutralize those institutions in order to facilitate private sector looting. In practice these may overlap or co-mingle.)" An American Tune -Al Etmanski

"It is peak season for US politics. We non-Americans watch entranced and disgusted by the search for shadows that are bound to lurk in the hearts of Presidential opponents, as they do in each of us. Hubris takes no prisoners as it fractures into partisan flags flying from solitary peaks. There must be no spaces in between, no middle ground in American democracy today. Being forsaken isn’t pretty.

The early settlers weren’t blown here on gusts of hope. They were more pragmatic and desperate. Cradled in the riches of North America their nightmares gave way with opportunity, cooperation, and hard work. You could be unrealistic in America and still make something of your dreams. Somehow over two centuries such bounty got confused with hope and hope got confused with destiny. 

You can’t be forever blest. Such certainty is bound to scorch, first in the lengthening shadow you cast and eventually in the heart that holds it. This is really what’s on display in American politics today - one last speculation on hope. But that will pass. Hope has evaporated from other peoples. From them Americans will discover more fundamental aspects of their character - courage, love, humility, resilience, reciprocity, trust, perseverance and yes, faith. 

Hope isn’t audacious. Courage is. Without it no other virtue is possible. It takes courage to confront your contradictions and wrong doings; to love opponents; to be curious about strangers; and to carry on even when driven to your knees.

Emily Dickinson used a bird metaphor to define hope as “the thing with feathers that perches in the soul.” But redemption does not have wings. Feathers are too light for the work ahead. The outlook may be bleak but many Americans are awakening to life in the spaces in between. They are not waiting as Emily Dickinson did for hope “to sing the tune.” They are rediscovering their faith in each other.

One of my concerns, is that some of the platforms we're gathering on, using, are a poor fit for leveraging the value of the folksonomy, for building further, for collaborating. I would like for us to collaborate on platforms conducive both for colaboration and designed to enable win-win-win outcomes. When I was a tween, when to give up Matchbox cars was something socially decided. I wouldn't have come up with the idea of "stop playing" on my own.

I find it bewildering that the American public and political establishment is focused on returning to the times of alleged American prosperity under the Clinton years. These were the times when we overpaid for houses that were much too large for our needs. The these were the times when we ran up our credit card balances to record levels buying extravagances and "toys" we had no business buying.

But like any good drunken night on the town, there's a price to pay the next day. Do we really want to repeat this "spend like drunken sailors" again. We know what comes the next morning.

Wouldn't this be a good time to take account of what we've learned. Wouldn't this be a good time to establish some more prudent behaviors and not assume government will bail out our bad decisions. 

Maybe this would be a good time to concentrate on "community" and strengthening our relationships with people ... rather than things. Creating the Future by Youth Learning from the Inside-Out

I've been asked to be a contributing editor for an online magazine (in development and not yet announced) for baby boomers looking to step into a meaningful and engaged life upon "retirement". Specifically, I'm working on the "Building Community" section. My role includes writing a few articles and, more importantly, collecting leading-edge resources that are inspiring, accessible, and conscious.

To that end, I would LOVE it if the good people here could share what spontaneously arises in terms of relevant articles/books/films/videos about building community that you would want the boomer generation to know about.

My hope and interest in the project is that connecting the right information, at this time, with an enormous generation in transition -- boomers started to reach retirement age a year ago => cognitive surplus & more time to get involved -- will produce multiplier effects for the good.

Thank you in advance! From the Euphrates Valley to the southern Peruvian Andes, early complex societies have risen and fallen, but in some cases they have also been reborn. They seek to discover how societal complexity reemerged, how second-generation states formed, and how these re-emergent states resembled or differed from the complex societies that preceded them. Wondering how we could develop something simple to help people explore the alternatives. 

I've curated something on pearltrees: http://www.pearltrees.com/t/team/id5509379. But ideally, I was thinking of using these wikipedia terms as markers and creating navigable graphs of linked data (links between these pages/memes and other pages that they link to) in the spirit of wikinodes, to fill in the blanks and follow the evolution of these memes and their associations... 

Any suggestions? I would love this to take its own life as a collective work and be put to good use.

The idea behind this is to let people engage in self discovery journeys by navigating from what they know and expanding by adjacency from there. http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/fifteen-citations-about-peer-to-peer-learning-and-education/2012/08/13 "In Studio: Recipes for Systemic change"

Perhaps a similar revolution for philanthropy is at hand?  

Givers in Anywhere Charity networks might offer small digital donations (eg http://is.gd/microscholarships) for localities around the planet, to the degree they gear up for – and upload experiences about – success in the Anywhere Economy.

In this way, Anywhere Charity could speed global awareness of grassroots uplift via the Anywhere Economy. 

A related opportunity for Anywhere Charity could be to reward localities that awaken actual assets.

John Robb has noted that communities will thrive by  'localizing production, virtualizing everything else.'

Besides encouraging grassroots entry to the Anywhere Economy, Anywhere Charity can boost digital donations for specific communities that speed transitions to sustainable Local Economies.

Such gifts, for example, could reward pilots of new agro, energy, 3D printing, and other innovations.  They could also be keyed to local progress towards transparent governance (putting the license/permit process and forms on the web, uploading neighborhood agreements on land titles and dispute resolution, etc.) The effect of such Local Economy moves could be to awaken land values, and provide an asset base for Local Charity (http://is.gd/endowmentzones).

Steven Putter, would offers on these lines – perhaps via Kickstarter campaign – be useful to jobseekers, students, and others in your community?  cc Alan Yelsey Lenore Thomas Ealy Zachary Caceres The discussion of language around complexity this weekend http://is.gd/8hxR00 has me seeing something that feels meaningful (not sure if it will still seem meaningful as the day gains strength, but I'll share it here just the same...). And that is that different people are at different points along a continuum of how they experience complexity. 

For some, the word itself is scary - they want things to be simple and linear. For others, they are curious, excited yet tentative - the notion of complexity is something they want to learn about, see where the various roads lead, dip a toe into. 

Still others are no longer dipping in, but surrounding themselves, immersed in (and delighted in) what it is to realize the interrelatedness of all things, modeling and unpacking and seeing everything through that lens.

And still others see that it may not be complex at all, but instead they calmly and joyfully see the simplicity in the very heart of the complexity - the ironic opposite end of the continuum where folks just want it to be simple...

My point in this observation is that if we are to be effect as Next Edgers in bringing about a different way of being in the world, we need to be able to relate to all those different people, at all those different stages of how they see the world.

Not sure where I'm going with this, but it has grabbed me powerfully this morning, and I'm just very appreciative of all in this weekend's discussion, for making this so clear for me this morning. Is anyone working on coordinating or correlating the media PRODUCTION side of this venture. Are our "shares" here more the result of personal offerings or discovery or is there some planning and design going on? I'd like to find someone in a media "group" working of conceptualizing and sharing the memes as they appear. Tom Atlee: "There are literally hundreds - probably thousands - of organizations, technologies, practices, theories, visions and proposals that already exist that could serve this transition. I suggest that all of them are weakened by failure to team up around a strategic vision such as this, and that all of them - and all of us - would be empowered beyond our wildest dreams if we engaged and succeeded in such a collaboration.

What do we need to do to enable this to happen?"

http://www.slideshare.net/happyseaurchin/the-math-of-social-unity-3 the "next edge" is doing it right, right where you are in your community Great question recently posted by DK Matai:
"How do social networks add value to your life? Which practices have you embraced to optimise the benefit from the time spent on social-nets?"

To which I responded:
What a great question! I'm not sure. What I do know is that if I try my darndest being myself, that helps others to engage. 

How to translate between engagement and return on engagement, without turning too optimizied, too instrumental, too effective and thus at risk of becoming someone else than yourself? I like Howard Rheingold's Net Smart in part maybe because I need reminding not to assume I am Net Smart. I'm astounded by Helene Finidori's synthesis and impressed with the architecture of this post.

How would your list look like..? What topic? And how would you present it? How is everything connected in your thoughts? Here is mine from last year - a current one would be different! Can you do the synthesis?

http://sharedtracks.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/motivation-driven-development-an-online-workshop/ I want to introduce Mr Ali Asghar who is a professor of Solar Energy in Hamdard University His work and interviews are documented by one of our team at Rehan Energy on www.RehanSolar.com

To that end I have been brought in as one of 90 experts as a member of the California Financial Opportunities Roundtable CALFOR -convened by the USDA Rural Development and Federal Reserve Bank of SF to create a guidebook for entrepreneurs seeking capital. 

We represented finance, impact investing, philanthropy, business, economic development, government and more.

Our ACCESS TO CAPITAL GUIDEBOOK is published today August 30th.
 
 Download the entire document and guidebook here: http://lnkd.in/drBdvY Excited to receive an advance copy of Giles Hutchin's The Nature of Business.  Here's the review I wrote for it: 

"For organisational leaders, The Nature of Business represents a compelling invitation and a comprehensive map for the journey not only toward sustainability but toward 'thrivability'.  Thoroughly researched, with bite-sized but powerful case studies sprinkled throughout, it sparks insights and ideas at every turn.  For the survival of our  species, my greatest hope is that leaders everywhere will embark on the journey Giles describes in this important book."

http://www.greenbooks.co.uk/natureofbusiness just had a nice chat with Steve Waddell - the author of Global Action Networks I want to Introduce here Mr Syed Khalil Ahmed He runs Indus Social Forum which has 11000+ members, trying to bring Social change in his part of the region of the world.

He is very young, and would love you all to be connected to him to see what changes he is bringing.

Remember 11000 young hot blooded, Internet expert young men can do a LOT of online work for you all, no matter where you are in the world :) Can't move my brain beyond this thought this morning - that "rethinking capitalism" feels like trying to fit a 10 year old into a 5 year old's clothes. It's not that capitalism is bad or good - it just no longer fits our needs. And there is only so much hem we can let down on the pant-legs of this system.

Feeling strongly that it's time for us to just go get new clothes that do fit. What is the world we DO want? How do we want people to relate to each other? And what systems will create that? No rethinking of what no longer fits; instead creating what will fit the world we want to create... I suppose lots of us know about such companies? Another epic conversation on Chris Martenson podcast. You're going to love this ~ 

While 72 percent of companies use social technologies in some way, very few are anywhere near to achieving the full potential benefit. In fact, the most powerful applications of social technologies in the global economy are largely untapped. Companies will go on developing ways to reach consumers through social technologies and gathering insights for product development, marketing, and customer service. I want to introduce here Mr Muhammad Ahmed Amin  he is 23 years old, and Dean and Vice Chancelor of Indus University in Karachi, Pakistan with 6000 Enrolled Students.

He is looking for PHD Teachers who would like to come and Teach in Pakistan as a visiting Faculty or permanent.

Remember his City has 20 Million people population, more than of Australia.

Comment by Øyvind Holmstad on the struggle between two world-systems, quoting Christopher Alexander:

"The architecture of our schools play a HUGE role for learning and belonging too, like Alexander’s Eishin Campus in Japan!

Here is the Amazon.com description of The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle between Two World-Systems, the new book to be published in October by Christopher Alexander:

“The purpose of all architecture, writes Christopher Alexander, is to encourage and support life-giving activity, dreams, and playfulness. But in recent decades, while our buildings are technically better–more sturdy, more waterproof, more energy efficient– they have also became progressively more sterile, rarely providing the kind of environment in which people are emotionally nourished, genuinely happy, and deeply contented.

Using the example of his building of the Eishin Campus in Japan, Christopher Alexander and his collaborators reveal an ongoing dispute between two fundamentally different ways of shaping our world. One system places emphasis on subtleties, on finesse, on the structure of adaptation that makes each tiny part fit into the larger context. The other system is concerned with efficiency, with money, power and control, stressing the more gross aspects of size, speed, and profit. This second, “business-as-usual” system, Alexander argues, is incapable of creating the kind of environment that is able to genuinely support the emotional, whole-making side of human life. To confront this sterile system, the book presents a new architecture that we–both as a world-wide civilization, and as individual people and cultures–can create, using new processes that allow us to build places of human energy and beauty. The book outlines nine ways of working, each one fully dedicated to wholeness, and able to support day-to-day activities that will make planning, design and construction possible in an entirely new way, and in more humane ways.” Is the American Dream holding America back? ~ http://bit.ly/OwcLui http://www.ingenesist.com/general-info/hacking-the-financial-system.html There's been a lot more exposing dialogue being entered into on facebook of late. Yet, despite the fact that we're all connected - we're not; not on this platform, not in a way that encourages generative dialogue about the things that seem to matter to us the most.

Georgi and I have been working on a new platform for the past four months, one that intends to provide a dedicated space for us to explore, together, the outer edges of our selves.

NaughtiYogii, while not quite ready to go, has evolved as a consequence of our growing awareness of the challenges so many of us are facing as we attempt to navigate an increasingly judgemental world. While there is no doubt that we as humans have a great deal more to learn, somehow, somewhere along the line, it seems as if we got lost, trapped between our notions of how we 'should' be while simultaneously attempting to come to peace with how we are.

I, for one, need somewhere to laugh at my own hypocrisy, to engage in supportive discussions about my deepest challenges and to overcome the earnestness that unintentionally permeates do-gooding everywhere. I need a place, online, where it's ok for me to be me, where I can meet with others as a flawed human being, without having to worry about the consequences to my business of admitting to my inconsistency. 

I tried doing that on facebook and it didn't work.

My most recent post is an introduction to this idea; if you like what we're on about, please share with your friends and your networks, sign up on the website and we'll let you know when we're ready to go.

http://www.scribd.com/doc/104169463/Edgeryders-Community-Paper-Learning-To-Live

Why does this matter. Because it goes to show that:
1) with relatively little effort a large number of us can contribute towards producing something of value to others and to ourselves in policy contexts.

2) It highlights one of the challenges of doing this where money is involved. This was a paid gig, I was originally offered 500 Euros to do the work but it would have felt weird to accept it. I accepted the contract and signed it in my name because the administrative mess of producing a large number of contracts to split 500 euros is just not feasible. Now I don't know what do do with the money, stick it into an Edgeryders paypal account or something...any ideas?

Come check out how we did and where it's going!

While the social entrepreneur or systems entrepreneur may seek to pursue a certain change goal, the systems diplomat is concerned with process before outcome. It trusts that the outcome is inherently known to the system, but simply lays dormant or unconscious. The diplomat seeks to make conscious that which is currently unconscious, and through this new understanding allows change to occur." http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/9543/oceans-of-innovation-the-atlantic-the-pacific-global-leadership-and-the-future-of-education

Really thought provoking paper by a former colleague in the UK Government on the (inevitable) shift in global leadership from Atlantic to Pacific. In particular, what that means for Pacific societies and what they can do to prepare for the shift. 

Really enjoyed the exploration of how Pacific countries should maximise the benefits through making fundamental changes to their education systems (emphasis shift from knowledge and skills aquisition to innovation, creative thinking and leadership), the make up of cities (homogenous to diverse) and culture (the balance between individual v collective). Our Future Society, part 101: Cocreate Shared Pull and Understanding

*What do you desire?*
Shared purpose in itself is necessary yet not sufficient. In order to cocreate our future society, we need to sufficiently align around a sufficient
ly desired pull. A purpose attractive enough, simple enough to understand, evoking and instilling a longing, a desire to move towards it.

*Change programmes often leads to waste of effort*
What is often an unnecessary constraint in many worthwhile projects and efforts, is the (hidden) expectations and assumptions that they need to take place wholly inside the old narratives. This makes it near impossible to achieve anything new, since all narratives typically resists being changed. One of the results of this, is that typically between 80 - 90 percent of change programmes are wasted.

*Catalyze, nurture and build on the resourcefulness of people*
A better approach, is to set up a pull, and build a sufficiently shared and shareable understanding in a large enough, critical mass of people (stakeholders, participants, players) in a way (eg through a desirable, empowering, sufficiently simple, sufficiently deep and rich catalyzing narrative) that instils a desire, a longing, to move towards it. Most people are quite resourceful finding paths towards reaching what they desire.

*A great sense of loss is perfect soil for seeds of renewal*
Right now, most people find themselves living between narratives - and thus, experiencing a great sense of loss, a sense of life having lost a significant part of its meaning. This is perfect, fertile soil for sharing seeds of longing for something new, for something different, for something more meaningful.

*Dialogue is Empowerment - Play is Resilience*
Through dialogue, this new sense of meaning can be glimpsed. The rest follows from trusting people's own resourcefulness, enabling and empower their own efforts where asked for and when appropriate.

*Play Is Resilience - One of many possible Tea House Sequences*

http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/NH28Ak03.html It's taken a while but I finally. FINALLY have some idea of what's up with the state of formal education in Europe.

It kind of started in 2010 when I participated in an event around learning Freedom and the Web hosted by Mozilla and co-organised by their community of volunteers (thank you Nathaniel James ). It was generative on many levels. I met some lovely people, and got the push I needed to explore some of my own interests to do with learning. More than anything I started to understand the importance of developing a personal frame of enquiry and a personal frame of enquiry. Last year I did several talks and workshops at events ranging from massive general audience ones like Learning without Frontiers organised by Graham Brown-Martin and smaller more specialised ones like the Free Culture Incubator organised by Ela Kagel.

Older generations, the private sector, government institutions and parents have contributed to society’s encouraging young people focus their energies, and put their eggs into the basket of being good at school (and penalising those who were not). And Education is big business with many stakeholders involved. What with youth unemployment hitting the roof there is a lot of debate around learning and many people are discussing the need for reforms in formal education systems in Europe (and beyond). They range all the way from snake-oil salesmen trying to sell gadgets and proprietary software as the end all solution to our educational woes to angry headteachers wanting minister's hide for unfairly changing the rules on kids in mid-game. There is a lot at stake.

But how did we get here and where does it make sense to push for change?

I think it's true for a lot of what we want to achieve that it is hard to get an overview of what's going on, what forces are pulling in which directions. This was part of the aim of getting the researchers help in contextualising the experiences we have been sharing and mapping out the territory. For me personally this is a much more important contribution because it helps us go ok- so this is what we are facing and then direct our energies pragmatically.

I read the research report that Piotr Mikiewicz and Pruden GE produced about Learning commissioned by Edgeryders. It was pretty interesting and a lot of things fell into place for me about how formal education works in Europe. So I spent the weekend summarising it for you, me and everyone we know.

We can do much much better that the state of contemporary political tennis matches- just cheap shots and no creative solutions. . It's oue future and we all own a stake in it. Come check it out, poke holes in it and add the questions you want to have answered. It's a good primer for those who want to understand how changes in other areas can affect the issues we especially care about. And upgrading the BS detectors never hurt :) The fund funds for social enterprises.... Something that may be stimulating to a few here...

"The world is analog, yet we have spent the last century force fitting the analog world into digital patterns to match the capabilities of digital computers. What if one could create analog models that run on today’s digital computers? The human’s left brain processes information sequentially, much like today’s IF|THEN|ELSE computer logic. Consider the size of the computer industry and functionality provided today by just focusing on half of the solution. The human’s right hemisphere of the brain processes information in parallel. It balances alternatives. It combines features to recognize objects. It deals with the changing value of information items based on time and distance. It solves problems with conflicting goals. It allocates resources across those conflicting goals and solves short term objectives and considers long term goals. It manages risk and reward. It decides “how much.” Your Digital Filing Cabinet - Evernote! Don't move to slow!

"Unveiled at the Rio+20 Summit in June, the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) 2012 is a joint product of the United Nations University International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme.
The IWR is the first in a biennial series and lays out the foundation of the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), a novel approach that strives to inject green accounting into the assessment of a country’s capital assets and move beyond the environmental shortfalls of other indicators. By assessing changes in natural capital (e.g., forests, watersheds, fossil fuels, fisheries) over time, in addition to produced (manufactured) and human capital, inclusive wealth puts new emphasis on the changing state of a country’s natural resource base, stressing its fundamental impact on long-term economic and social sustainability."

I was born in the mountains in Virginia both my parents were New Englanders. When I was 8 we moved to Greenville, South Carolina. One of the first things that happened to me was to get beat up by a neighborhood kid for being a Yankee. It was a set up,  the kid's mother intervened before the beating got completely out of hand. She then proceeded to lecture me about what it is to be a Southerner.

The way the story of the Southern Culture of Honor is usually told is about settlement patterns of herders and farmers. I was only 2 when my family moved from the mountains of Virginia to the mountains of Maryland, even still I've got an affinity for hill-people. And I think the way the story is told gets hill-people wrong, but so be it, that's how the story is told. Because I was an oddball I've long wondered what is it with being Southern. Lots of Americans wonder too, and honor goes a long way towards understanding.

As a point of academic interest the Southern Culture of Honor is mostly viewed from the perspective of pathology. That's a useful perspective, but misses quite a lot. Kwame Appiah has done a good service by pointing out how honor can remake society--how honor can produce positive cultural change.

I was thinking along these lines prompted by DK Matai's Gold thread. Then this afternoon happened on a remembrance of the great musician Chet Atkins by Janis Ian, herself a Yankee in the South. Ian's piece bring to life how honor can change society in the story of Chet Atkins. http://www.janisian.com/reading/atkins.php Return on Sustainability? Yes!

The posters will be displayed in a high-circulation location and the idea is that people can leave post-it notes with pointers, offers of help, etc. The hope is that projects will visibly evolve through the weekend.

Assuming the approach has merit, what would you think might be the essential elements that need to be on such a template?

Where are you camping?

Shall we schedule a gathering there? You know, the more face/embodied time I share with my tribe, the more I commit to making all my time/space Intentional. That being said, I'd be very interested in (co-)spearheading an effort for this community (and its offline extensions) to create a shared calendar indicating regional events that we are already involved in/hosting as well as to add to that calendar ongoing Next Edge/Tribal gatherings in various cities on a rolling basis (as well as, potentially, scheduled online "hangouts" to chat in a less formal/project based manner). 

I know we created a master list of contacts organized by region in the past (or we got somewhere on that effort) but it's not something that is serviceable in providing an offline infrastructure for interaction beyond the random notifications of one-off events and/or larger scaled conferences, etc. but I think we can do more -- ritualized connection does wonders for the spirit and less strictly planned space allows for the magic of our intelligence to do its own intuitive, energetic work. 

I'm NYC/northeast, so that's where I can begin on the local end, at least, though I'd like to discuss the virtual potential as well with interested parties.

Sir, I wonder if Jem Eskenazi read the same Atlas Shrugged that I did? As I recall, it was a story about how a ragtag band including a minimum wage railway worker, a playboy, and a pirate took down a corrupt, corporatist government and the villainous, politically connected bankers and industrialists by convincing the best and the brightest to stop selling their souls to Corporate America. If I didn't know any better, I'd say it reads like a Manual for Occupy Wall Street!

The case in Pakistan, we'll have to wait and see how people react. I think that you choose your battles in life, and in cases like these, you choose to back the cases that are in line with your fundamental values. It's not a matter of justice, it's a matter of personal ideology. The kinds of things happening under Putin are nothing compared to countless governments around the world that are doing things that are much, much worse. You choose your battles, and in the West we love crapping on Russia. If it happened in the Ukraine, we wouldn't care so much.

How is it going?

For those who don't know me or what I'm doing (now), I'm part of ELL [Emerging Leader Labs]. The seed will end August 31st. 

There will be a 3-4 week hiatus between seed and official opening and I need to have some places I can be. Then I will go back to ELL in Chatam, New York when the official labs open.

I'm kind of pulling a Connor Scott Turland. [Well.. sort of. But close enough.] I think of it as... edgesurfing! [Got to have a good attitude about it right?]

I'm in Chatham New York, but also have using actual New York city as an edgesurfing option.

I can always got back to where I come from, but right now the old story has no power over me and I need to be able to sustain this new one.

This is to ensure the transformation of my life persists and does not get reset back to a slightly modified version of the old story. The old story has always been destructive. Always will be. 

But in the new story, the people from my old story are also much better off, because they can learn how to take care of themselves better, instead of just... hurting me on end, in every way possible, which also makes me lose my mind.

Um... my mind is kind of valuable. But more importantly, so is my spirit! (:

There is no way to avoid this hiatus and I wouldn't want to jeopardize what ELL is doing by 'forcing' them [Which would not work anyway and not how I roll.] to opening the official labs and 'social lab network'/template immediately.

I plan on making it an adventure and doing lots of 'edgesurfing!' (I currently do not trust couchsurfing, as I require more information about it [and persuasion... Just being honest. But 'surfers' can't be total 'choosers'] I

I plan on having interesting conversations and perhaps some small-scale collaborations as well as more networking.

I am checking out some local options and there are also some tentative ones. I really have nothing to worry about as long as I get the word out and see who in my network is able to help me. 

There may a lot of shifting around and sustainable resilience in action. When I go back after this period, I expect that my network and the people I can give value too, will be will more imaginal than before. Even if just a 'little.'

I have about 2 weeks (more or less) then to get this figured out. I think I can do it... I've made it this far!

Be sure to of course leave me with phone numbers or any other important contact info if you want to talk more about it and explore some.

So some people can PM [personal facebook message] me and/or post on here. Just trying to get more social alchemy in motion.

There is a vast amount of infrastructure—transportation, communication, financing, production—openly available that, until recently, was only accessible to very large organisations. It now takes relatively little—a few dedicated, knowledgeable people—to connect these pieces into a powerful platform from which to act.

Teaching yourself without schooling.... “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” —Mark Twain http://santacruz.patch.com/articles/exploring-the-ethical-responsibilities-of-psychedelic-shamanism At last I found an article of this myth, this resonates 100 % with my thinking. All this "buzz" about entrepreneurial employees is rubbish! Just the trick of established companies to camouflage their pitfalls of organizational culture.

Ref from article: "Some CEOs go so far as to say, 'We want all of our 300,000 employees to be entrepreneurs.' It is just complete nonsense," says Len Schlesinger, Babson's president and author of Just Start. "The reality is that you're asking people to display a set of behaviors in an environment that, by its very nature, tends to be very hostile to those activities."

http://sharedtracks.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-next-big-trend-on-the-internet-after-search-of-google-and-social-of-facebook/ "They communicate with eachother very much like our brain cells, through oscillating patterns of waves and changing of connections.

"The paper below explains the very basic parts of their wave based communication but does not go into detail about the large scale patterns of the waves or if that possibility was thought about at all.

Like brain cells, crickets change which other crickets they are connected to. Neurons (brain cells) do this by changing which other neurons or axons their axons connect to, as a result of the electric and chemical patterns oscillating together or in different patterns. Crickets change which crickets they are connected to by flying to places they like the sounds of other crickets more. They become neurally connected to the other crickets some amount in how their neurons adjust to the local sounds of other crickets, so they start to make their oscillating sounds mostly in synchronization. Like brainwaves, the sounds of large groups of crickets flow in smooth waves and react to other waves depending on direction and timing and at least the recent history of waves in that location.

The wave based communication of Humans is far more limited than crickets, seen in places like dance clubs, prices in stock markets (less total stocks than neurons in a small number of crickets brains), body language, etc, but these wave based communications of Humans do not tend to spread to other Humans nearly as well as oscillating sounds spread in large groups of crickets. Humans communicate mostly in words. Crickets communicate mostly in waves. There are waves of words as ideas flow through society, which we call memes, but at the brainwave level we are still communicating between brain cells like crickets communicate with sound."

-What do you mean, bicycle?

-Here it is, take a look?

(leaning out the car window)
-Ah, you mean a bike! Nice, would love to take a ride!

-Cool! Why don't you?

-Erh, you mean, now?

-Yes.

-Can I remain here? It's really comfy inside my Rolls...

-No, you can't.

-Do you mean I actually have to climb out of the car?

-Yes.

-Erh, ehm, can I at least bring the minibar with me?

-Well, I guess we could find a way to remove the minibar and strap it onto the bicycle with duct tape or something...

-Cool!

-Then again, you can't actually drink from the minibar while pedalling.

-Pedalling? You mean I have to pedal, using my own legs and feet?

-Yes.

-Can't I tell my driver to pedal for me?

-Well, yes, you could, but you see, if you look through the perspex, you'll notice that there's no-one at the wheel, your driver left long ago, which is why your car-trip has been a bit bumpy lately, you left the actual road around 2008 thereabouts and have been going through the fields ever since.

-Aha. I kind of noticed that it was only with difficulty I could juggle things in here.

-So, you coming?

-You mean you think it's safe for me to climb outside?

-Not only is it much more safe for you to climb out of the car and hop on to the bike, there's a bus further down the road and if you make the effort, we can all continue on our journey. Once there, you can put your bike on the bus roof until we're close enough to your new digs.

-Ok then, erh, can I still bring my minibar?

-I've actually got another idea for you, right next to your new digs, there's a good place to start a micro-brewery. Fancy join and help distill some good concoctions?

-Would it be possible to build a whole new minibar there then?

-It most certainly would.

-Ok then, I'm in!

-Well, yes, you are. Still in, still inside the Rolls...

-Ah, I see what you mean, Wait up, I'll join

https://plus.google.com/u/0/101010252943098026073/posts/CbsDmya2NJQ Dear Next Edge, I'm excited that we have two hikes happening in August. The below is a copy of the email we've sent to humanistic hikers seeking to change the world. Yall are warmly welcome to join. 
Cheers,
-Bobby Fishkin
Dear humanistic, multi-disciplinary, extremely creative people with aspirations to change the world who happen to hike, I am pleased to say that we have our next two hikes scheduled,

I'm excited that we've found a date & time when Howard Rheingold can join David Hodgson, Katie Johnson and I, Bobby Fishkin for a hike in Marin along with some other excellent humans. This hike will take place on Thursday August 16th. 

The hike itself will begin at 5:30 from near the Mountain Home Inn 810 Panoramic Highway Mill Valley, CA 94941. 

But this time we are approaching the challenge of gathering differently than we have in the past. David, Katie and Bobby will gather early with all who wish to gather early from 3:30pm on at Dipsea Cafe. Dipsea cafe is located at 200 Shoreline Hwy, Mill Valley, CA 94941 ( just when you get off the highway). We'll be there until a little past 5 when we will carpool over to the Mount Home Inn and from there we will head on to the trail. Dipsea is a nice little cafe with Greek snacks, coffee, tea, bear, wine, etc. We would recommend that people who are able to meet there first do so because this will guarantee that you will be able to join the hike when it goes. Our Marin hikes leave almost on time. 

I'm also pleased to say that we've found a time when David Hodgson, Katie Johnson and I, Bobby Fishkin can join in for a hike in San Francisco. Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and cadence of creativity. 

For our San Francisco hike please arrive by 5:50pm on Friday August 24th at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue  San Francisco, CA 94121). We will then hike down to Eagle's Point and on to the Sutro Baths Cave before returning to the Legion of Honor.  Here is the trail map, heading counter-clockwise from the Legion of Honor-- http://www.everytrail.com/guide/lands-end-san-francisco/map#poi-0.

After the Legion of Honor, a bunch of us will carry on forward to Fort Mason where dozens of food trucks and live music will be available to us.

We will have a good hike. Please let us know if you will be joining so that we know to look out for you. 

You can join the google group for hiking info- http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level. 

You can RSVP for either hike on its respective Facebook event page or you can do so by email:

August 16th- http://www.facebook.com/events/361013077304558/?context=create

"We are witnessing the emergence of a new ‘proto’ mode of production based on distributed, collaborative forms of organisation. … The current capitalist system is based on two entirely erroneous premises: first, that nature is abundant and can be infinitely exploited to obtain endless growth; and second, that sharing of innovation, culture and science should be hampered through privatisation of intellectual property – an imposition of artificial scarcity. These macro-economic principles are then written into the ‘constitutions’ of profit-maximising corporations, which are legally obliged to enrich their shareholders by maximising social and environmental externalities. Peer production models show us a new possible reality in which the democratic civic sphere, productive commons and a vibrant market can co-exist for mutual benefit. This model has three dimensions. At the core of value creation are various commons, where innovations are deposited for all humanity to share and build on. These commons are facilitated and protected through non-profit civic associations, with the ‘partner state’ as their territorial equivalent, empowering and enabling that social production. Around the commons emerges a vibrant economy undertaken by different kinds of ethical companies, whose legal structures tie them to the values and goals of the commons communities, not absentee and private shareholders’ intent of maximising profit at any cost."

We estimate it will take 10 to 15 years for structured securitised credit to replace to displace completely the classical lending system -not a long time, considering that the fundamentals of banking have remained essentially unchanged since the Middle Ages.” I would love to try to help this project come alive again -Sustainable energy production

This article is deeply condensed relevance. Free webinar on building relationships with foundations. Thanks Claudia Baier for the lead! in light of the current US election season..

"Extractive institutions, whether feudalism in medieval Europe or the use of schoolchildren to harvest cotton in contemporary Uzbekistan, transfer wealth from the masses to elites. In contrast, inclusive institutions—based on property rights, the rule of law, equal provision of public services, and free economic choices—create incentives for citizens to gain skills, make capital investments, and pursue technological innovation, all of which increase productivity and generate wealth. Economic institutions are themselves the products of political processes, which depend on political institutions. These can also be extractive, if they enable an elite to maintain its dominance over society, or inclusive, if many groups have access to the political process. Poverty is not an accident: “[P]oor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty.” Therefore, Acemoglu and Robinson argue, it is ultimately politics that matters."

economic power is _always_ a positive feedback loop, politics is the negative feedback loop to counter that, and really the only question of import in politics is how much is political power aligned with economic power. The greater the alignment the greater the corruption of the system. When designing the governance system for a nation the key to longevity is to put mechanisms into place to keep political power isolated from economic power.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou6dFH8Qr30 I think we should distinguish Exclusive Capitalism (what I do and own, is none of your business as long it's within the law) and Inclusive Capitalism (what I do and own, and how I own, will affect everything and everyone around me, and therefore asks me to be careful, considerate and accept limits to my behavior, or better demands me to consider my contribution to the whole, rather than just to me). If we want to change the global mentality, we not only need to consider economics, models, education, politics and the state of the world. We also need to consider our mentality as we train it in sports.

I've been working with Kyle over the past week or so to begin creating space for ongoing posts that would be run as a combination of the "AWESOME CREATOR" and "FIELD NOTES" series that I offer as a platform to creatives on Exit Strata. 

What is important for me is that this serves to remind the creative community that "creative" action is both "art" as well as life -- and to remind our social entrepreneur community that those who have chosen "art" AS life often have a lot of gifts and strategies from which we can learn. 

There is so much for us to give each other. Our AWESOME CREATOR series highlights the work of important, challenging creation on the part of community members from a range of disciplines, while the FIELD NOTES series functions in particular as a space for the community to validate and explore process over product: to "open source" their work as well as the life that they may not categorize AS work -- in the process encouraging mindfulness and reflexivity.

In inviting members from this community/leader labs to engage with us not to talk about "product" but the challenge of building from the INSIDE we humanize the experience. I invited Kyle to begin the series as the first man on the ground, the first "participant-observer" (to borrow from my own anthro training) in particular *because* of his non-"expert" position. The honesty of the challenge and the confusion and the reality of difficulty is beautiful and wonderful to share and experience together, and to air. The stories will find new audiences, who may give back to this network creative inspiration or collaboration of a sort not previously imagined.

If you're not yet familiar with how ExSt is envisioned as a platform, you can read my recent interview with coldfront mag here. 

coldfrontmag.com/features/poetry-festival-preview-exit-strata

I know that you are the guiding team and therefore busy but before we start running with it I want to invite you to be part of introducing the series and also to feel free to send images, video, notes, quotes, and framework -- as well as any guidance towards what you might NOT want shared. 

I'm hoping that you are excited to share the guts and go behind the curtain as in keeping with the P2P philosophy of the organization but I do understand that sometimes storytelling can feel premature. ... 

that said. open to your ideas and guidance and also your contributions. excited to move ahead. kyle and I wait on your thoughts. 

I'm going to try to get up there either at the end of this month or when the next cycle starts... I'm not far away. Whenever I can do the most to be of aid and won't be in the way :)

oh btw -- good news, we have fiscal sponsorship for Exit Strata now so are beginning to write grant apps and fund ourselves for these programs in earnest! I await your thoughts. LOVE! thank you for what you do.

onward. Just a reminder that we have a small subgroup of Next Edgers who have formed to help each other complete projects via gift economy. Let me know if you want to join.

I think Global Village Movement can lead to collective shift and healing the world, especially when we focus on the economic aspect, which is occupying the intentions of the majority.

Dear All,

I have been in touch with most of you in the course of the last few weeks about the intended Network Meeting which is going to happen tomorrow, Friday, 11AM CET (summertime). I am informing some additional friends,too.

Just as a reminder: more than 20 people will come together on Friday in the rural village of Aigelsberg near Polling near Altheim in the Austrian Border Region of Innviertel at the farm of Rajah Guptara-Öllinger. Rajah is an active network member, with family roots in India, who partly turned his farm into a fine touristic and convention location. We are considering creating a critical mass of activities to "brand" Rajah's farm as a hub for learning and study activities,  especially on all facets of Global Villages, and tomorrow's event is a small inauguration of these.

We have a very fine selection of people attending physically. Among them will be the founder of the New Work Movement, Frithjof Bergmann, and many others involved in the renaiscance of the local in the global age.  The first part of the event, from 11AM to 1PM Central European Summertime, will be dedicated to short presentations - not limited to the people present, but also synchronously and simultaniously connected to remarkable people worldwide in village situations. We will do this with Skype powered by a cloud videoconferencing service (Videomeet). So we will have the possibility to make use of up to 25 interactive streaming slots. In the afternoon we will continue and focus on the local workgroups, but we still will use and pay attention to some global interaction. See below the technical details including the team for production and backchanneling on site.

We will convene contentwise around the following themes:

* Is there a new quality in village to village cooperation when we are empowered by bandwidth?  One person that will give us first hand experience is Chis Conder from B4RN, a rural broadband user alliance in the UK.
* Will there be shared themes that villages all over the world could work on? We hope to hear from: Barbara Kovats from Solar Power Village Tamera in Portugal's Alentejo; from Richard Nelson and Richard Hogan at Greenfire Farm in Ohio/USA and many others about Village Innovations that make a difference.
* How can we possibly cooperate? Andrew Sandakov und Jean Jebanov from the Russian Republic of Buryatia will issue a call for synchronous coaching and cooperation in rural permaculture - possibly with iPads in the field.
* What can we achieve? Kordian Euris will present the amazing development of Open Source Ecology as one example how shared knowledge will enable us to regain our basic values of life.
* Where will we end up? Dagmar Eisenbach and John Broomfield will show the case study of Bittlebronn, a bioenergy village in Southwestern Germany that has achieved a lot with a bioenergy plant and is aiming for new horizons in village development. Tony Gwilliam  and Marita Vidal from Bloo Lagoon holiday village will show what village aesthetics can mean to us.

We have a very clear goal, even if the development is still based on individual goodwill and voluntary contributions and the event is self constructing: we want to see a virtual university of the village, a stregnthening stream of knowledge, experience and empowering relations built up and maintained by this media connections which will become habitual in the years to come. If we understand that this is a fourth resource that complements the soil, the water and the sunlight, that we have to install it rigourously and use it primarily to raise our level of autonomy, then the possibilities are endless.

We think that in today's world the village, the local community of people, is a much needed life support system that we rediscover and redesign after the Big Industrial Dream that has turned into a nightmare. And instead of crisis, decay and destruction brought about by the industrial spirit of competition, we seek to lay the base for a truly cooperative world.

The village will be at the centrepiece of this world, playing a similar role in a world society as individuals play in a local society. Villages will be the voluntary associations to realize and manifest values, they will be the convergence point of the cultural communities that are blooming in masses facilitated by the Web. But they will be much more - they will be the microcosm that allows us to digest the manifold offerings of the world in a meaningful and productive way and turn them into an abundant local reality everywhere.

I hope we can do our event in this spirit tomorrow. The purpose is also to create a first video documentation about the idea of Global Villages with the help of the material gathered.

Technically, those of you who want to participate are cordially invited - but please mind the fact that we have only 25 slots. We will turn off audio and video interactivity most of the time due to limited bandwidth (you can still watch the stream, just not interact by speaking or video) - Rajah's farm has only a mobile provider connection for the time being. A short and hot presentation can always be squeezed in but we will keep a rough ratio of 16 - 20 presentations with 8-10 online and 8-10 local. We hope that you will be able to see them all.

You can either participate by web-browser or by Skype. Skype is highly recommended.

You will get a link to the form https://bluejeans.com/2787801/xxxx/skype  (I will send you the PIN later with the schedule).

Markus Petz will be backchannel operator and communicate with you during the event and empowered to be time watchdog and even modify the sequence,
Werner Strasser will be online connection and switching operator,
David Röthler will be the director of local production,
Georg Pleger will be post production advisor,
I (Franz) will do the moderating.

Please make sure you added Skype contact with the following accounts:
Franz Nahrada  - skype handle = globalvillagesinfo
Markus Petz - skype handle = vogelfreimarkus

It is highly reccomended that you go online one hour before the interactive part, that means at 10 AM Central European Summertime., so that we can confirm scheduling and are able to handle conectivity.

I am looking forward to this challenge!

On the other hand, we have won. Now the whole world sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated. The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. Once again, Russia looks different in the eyes of the world from the way Putin tries to present it at daily international meetings. All the steps toward a state governed by the rule of law that he promised have obviously not been made. And his statement that the court in our case will be objective and make a fair decision is another deception of the entire country and the international community. That is all. Thank you."

Over the past 1-2 years or so, I've been interviewed a few times by phone/Skype from someone doing his PhD research on what leadership skills and habits it takes to create social change around environmental sustainability. 

If you'd like to be one of the interviewees in his study, see below and reach out to EJ.  It's also OK to forward this to anyone else who may be interested.

Funded by the US National Science Foundation, EJ Wensing is conducting a post-doctoral social science research study of leaders of initiatives for sustainability in the Arctic, Northeastern United States, and the Caribbean. This group includes social entrepreneurs, activists, positive deviants, knowledge managers, etc. He seeks to profile the attitudes and behaviors most equitable with generating a sustainable future from the local to the global community across cultures.

Please contact him at ejwensing@ecosphere.net for more information and to participate in the study. Participation would involve on-site or telephone interviews, surveys, and focus group discussions. Participation will help promote your initiatives to other leaders, the academic community, students, policy makers, and the media.

I'm honored to be part of this group, and looking forward to the spiraling, emergent collaborations which will most surely spring forth!!! The Next Green... Where are we in the west, when China builds relationship with the whole continent of Africa states? Why became China suddenly so interested in Africa? 

China understands that we live in a constant state of change, perhaps also why humans became human and the need for a constant balancing act between the earth and human, community and the individuals and the humans inner balance. 
 
But China’s rulers are playing with a hidden agenda that utilizes knowledge of the times to strengthen the national position and the Communist Party’s power.

An understanding of the present and the three fundamental conditions of human life is the premise in order to ask the right questions.  Otherwise we will be wasting our efforts on societal innovations in pseudo-constructions!

Are we in the West be able to match China, we must understand the present and without hidden agenda to unleash the power of human life and demolish all the hierarchies. We have to play the same game but even better. Fair for real!

If we understand the present and the three fundamental conditions of human life, we need to replace all the norms and rules that prevent these three basic conditions. Dare we, we have a chance to win the fight against China. Maybe it feels uncomfortable and unusual, but it’s not difficult. It can be upsetting and unpleasant, but it’s not very expensive. It may be unorthodox and unconventional, but just because of that it is real societal innovation, what makes us win the fight. Hello all,
I know this question has come up, more and less implicitly, in the conversations here before. I would like to revisit with a focus on being fairly concrete and specific:
How do you, in your own time/attention/resource management, connect (or not), integrate (or not), phase (or not), balance (or not) 
investing into start-ups and/or group endeavors that are focused mainly a "common good" (social benefit mission) which, at best, will generate revenue "later" (if all goes well and becomes a social enterprise) AND the more immediate revenue-generation for daily living? 

My current model is "multiple lives/careers" with some phasing and some overlap between social-benefit start-up investments of time/attention/energy/opportunity cost and, on the other hand, corporate consulting and MBA teaching work. Not sure if that is ideal - but I guess "edge" often is the antithesis of available organizational context seeking to harness people who think/act/relate differently.  
 In this spirit - if you come across contacts who may have need and budgets  in the realm of international/intercultural competence development, teams or leadership development, or OD needs on a more situation-aligned organizational behavior - I would very much love to hear about them. I have a solid track record in conventional settings;  "edge-venture" is not a prerequisite for me to make a contribution. Be assured, the revenue generated will help fund my "idealistic" habits and actions (rather than egotistic material accumulations).

And please share your stories how you dance the dance between "edge" and "exisiting structures and constraints"! I trust, upon reflection, much can be learned.

Thank you!! Storytelling is the best value system ever created. It never stopped. It only has... changed. Could high energy prices (not just oil) end globalization? And might that be a good thing? Trade can promote better international relationships... but how much trade... and of what kind... are we really best served by?

Casting my fate to the wind! Friends, I'm working on a program that faces fear head on, and it's the most important ass kicking I've given myself in a while. If anyone is so inspired to do these exercises with me, whether publicly or not, I want to share them with you. You can message me directly if you want to dialogue more about it, or you can respond here, or you can quietly use them for your own self-reflexive work.

I love you. 

A beginning:

1. What does fear mean to you? 
2. Where does fear show up in your daily life? 
3. What are you most afraid of? 
4. Identify the color and shape of fear. 
5. Where in your body does fear live and manifest itself? 
6. What do you get when you choose fear in your life? "A simple photograph can change the world."

I have recently been cleaning out my Twitter account, removing bots and other accounts, inactive accounts, noisy accounts, etc. Part of the reason was that I've been stuck at the 2000 mark for years and can never Follow new accounts on Twitter because of it. So to add people I want to Follow, I need to do some house-cleaning. Now I want to ask the collectivity: What Twitter accounts do you find "indispensable"? What Twitter accounts are a "Must-Follow"? To specify what my information needs are, I'm looking for people who are either early adopters or polymaths or people who have a brilliant ability of finding signal in the noisy information streams.. I'm looking for people who make amazing discoveries on a daily basis, an hourly basis, so that I can follow them on Twitter. Thanks. It can be a corporate or institutional account, doesn't have to be an individual. Thanks again. http://1588367.videoconference.talkfusionlive.com/golive/m/eruh8BShw5eq7lXA

I like it because I think we connect in text but in primal terms we connect with our eyes. About.me allows for an avi that is basically - face sized.

I link it to my twitter in the hope that people will follow that link and make a more visceral connection to the person behind the tweets....with all her faults, all her foibles, her passions and her joys.

On a side note - when I was building hyperlocavore...I had committed to platform as service because I did not want to spend my time worrying about server security.

Hello Beautiful People, I want to introduce to you another Super Man here , Mohsin Ahmed Patoli .

He administors a group on here, with 11000 Excited, sharp, on fire students and youngsters ready to change the world, from the INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION  Indus Social Forum it is called.

People say word Industrialization come from that part of the world, I would strongly recommend people here to join this group, and take advantage of these people, to become the activists that you need to make YOUR PROJECT go ON FIRE !!!

I have met Mr Mohsin, and he him self is a remarkable and Amazing human being. Welcome Aboard The answers to social innovation must be sought outside the established institutions of a sphere based on the constant change, why humans became human and basic values of our survival; the balance between earth and man, the balance between the Community and the individual and the person's inner balance.

Social Construction today and yesterday based on what exists, societies that survive the passage of time. “Folkhemmet” and the Welfare state are typical examples of these social constructions. EU norms and institutional forms and treaties breathe the same setting. Basic Structures that with some adjustments here and there adapted to the passage of time. This means that we have constantly recurring transformative shifts, rather than an approach in which we constantly adapt to the constant change.

Social structure has ever since humans left the life of roving collectors and hunters have been structured in a hierarchy, with a negative view of human as an individual. Human must be directed and controlled because it does not know his own good. The hidden agenda through the millennia is about power.

With power hierarchies also created other new values about clans, groups, States power and wealth, rather than the fundamental values that were the conditions for man's superiority as a race on earth: the ability to cooperate in an equal life with others.

This means that we must move the focus away from hierarchies, organizations, leadership and governance models to various forms of self-organization, where we as individuals together to take responsibility and solve problems, as employees and as citizens of situations and relationships that build social capital and common values on real rather than policies, visions and goals decided by others.

Today is not valued the basal values for survival, but these are seen only as costs, instead, valued things that hinder rather or poorer prospects for survival. The answer to social innovation is such that turns prospects right and can bring value and not just cost of ecological capital, social capital and human capital and thus challenge our established standards of value assets.

Many of the cheap, simple ideas he spreads for free from one poor village to another with the inventor's blessing. Some he is working to bring to market, ensuring the innovator gets the credit and the profit that will spur others to create as well. Many ideas are simply documented in his database waiting for some investor to spot their potential. He routinely dispenses tiny grants, either from a government fund or his own web of organizations, to help poor innovators finish their projects." crazy idea: Idea: Our dollars should be backed by our virtues instead of by "Full faith & credit in the US gov" Which by US gov they mean mostly congress. Which currently has near single digit approval ratings (12%) making our money close to worthless. (and we wonder why our economy is in the dumps)

I propose a better way... Virtue backed currency. A city's quality of life should be measured on the economic metrics of the Legatum Institute's prosperity index. Every single neighborhood should be evaluated based on these economic indicators (which measure every sector not just finance) The higher score the city earns means the stronger that city's currency is. http://www.prosperity.com EPA"s Corn Ethonal Quotas Could Spell Death For Cattle Farms http://www.dailytech.com/EPAs+Corn+Ethanol+Quotas+Could+Spell+Death+for+Cattle+Farms/article25334.htm The emergence of praxis opens a space for the systemization of the specular economy.

"Central to my narrative of ‘Valve’s way’ was the notion of an ‘alternative spontaneous order’: one that emerges within a corporation (as opposed to within a market-society) on the basis of individual time allocations (as opposed to price signals). The tantalising thought arose, during my musings, that this organisational structure may be as scalable as a market mechanism (assuming that the right technologies are in hand, ensuring transparency and low communications’ costs within the company)."

Ready for FREE internet ? I raised this issue the other day in a different group: Will Internet 2.0 or WWW 3 or 4, lead to new forms of "digital" tribalism?" I speculated about some regions of the world where, continuing friction along tribal lines makes a joke of the fictitious 'national boundaries' drawn in the sands of the past few centuries (largely at the point of a sword or other weapon). I wonder aloud, about "new ways of threading" communities together that doesn't require contiguous boundaries.

"Savedoff distinguishes two basic patterns: ‘global governance’ based on expanding various functions of the nation state to a global level (e.g. UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO, EU, WHO), and a more fluid ‘multipolarity’ of ‘mixed coalitions’ of the willing, including non-state actors (examples: International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the Global Fund). Savedoff argues that we are ending an anomalous period of global governance, and returning to a status-quo ante of multipolarity" Sorry for double messages today:

I am pleased to introduce Mr Abdur Rehman Usmani who has created a wonderful place in Baluchistan, Pakistan. A very very remote part of Pakistan, where there is a LOT of problems going on of civil war etc.

A world class school + boarding for people for free.

Check it out this video, and please suggest him some funding options that he is seeking

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8FiR_oKoUM Phil Jones initiated a thread for people to talk about microfinance without getting bogged down in other discussions. I hope people participate. But in my easily muddled mind I was so interested in the "other" discussions that came up in Mitra Ardron's original thread. Among the "other" discussions was: What is a responsible tone for a muckraker to take? Many seem to agree that Hugh Sinclair gets the tone wrong.

That's a hard question. Temperamentally I find it easier to beat up on big banks than organizations like Kiva. Moe Tkacik is one of my favorite muckrakers. Does she get the tone right in her post "Confessions of an Economic Hate Crime"? I'm interested both in framing and substance.

http://www.daskrap.com/2012/7/confessions-economic-hate-crime In psychoanalytic theory, "defenses" are seen as the way that the unconscious protects the mind from seeing or acknowledging something that it is convinced will destroy it.  The unconscious is always in the move with these kinds of shenanigans, so it will only be managed, not dispelled.  Oh well.  But it's one thing for an individual to grapple with such defensed on the couch, and another thing when it affects the courtroom and crucial, time sensitive climate change pro activity. Anyone here know of any good Facebook Groups similar to The Next Edge but that maybe engage in more theoretical, philosophical, speculative discussions, without New Age spirituality or too much systems theory? You know, just good old classical philosophy.. modern philosophy too, but specifically the abstruse, abstract stuff nobody likes to think about.. not the New Age stuff, mainstream critical theory stuff, etc. Thanks.

http://youtu.be/gJ2Mt9dNa6Q In evolutionary systems such as economies and other social systems, one cannot predict what will happen; one can only look back at what worked and explain it in its particular local, historical context. In this sense, evolutionary systems are like good stories: one cannot predict, but one can retrodict. The fact that it all seems inevitable, though, creates the false impression that we can then predict what will happen next. But we are wrong.

http://vimeo.com/42780071 Future Peace: Breaking Cycles of Violence through Futures Thinking: "Through the use of MRI scans, we have discovered the area of the brain we use to remember past events is the same area of the brain we use to envision our future (Bar, 2009; Barbey et al, 2009; Buckner & Carrol, 2007). While the implications regarding our decision making process are yet to be determined, it is possible that individuals who live in violence have neurological pathways designed to plan for more violence based on the interconnectedness of the brain mechanisms that remember the past and imagine a future. In other words, breaking out of cycles of violence may be complex because of an actual neurological barrier to naturally design a future that is drastically different from the past."

Our first video produced while participating in the PIE (Portland Incubator Experiment) http://vimeo.com/46661516 "a Principled Society is a membership organization. Other well-known membership organizations include AARP, the National Organization for Women, and your local Chamber of Commerce. Unlike these, however, a Principled Society is not a nonprofit. Nor is it a profit-maximizing corporation. It is a socially responsible corporation that is a blend of both. Like a nonprofit, it seeks to maximize the public good. Like a for-profit, it does not rely on charity for funding its ongoing operations and expansion. A Principled Society is managed by its members through collaborative direct democracy. As such, a Principled Society is its members. It is an association of people who choose to cooperate."

(IRL as compared to FB groups like this) If you're in the Bay Area, I *highly* recommend checking out the 1968 exhibit at the Oakland Museum, there until August 19th!  I had no idea HOW MUCH social, economic and political change was happening in that one, single year.  Totally interesting, inspiring, and entertaining for anyone who's working on social, economic or political change now.  F'ng great!  "Experience one of the most powerful years in recent history in this unforgettable exhibition exploring the social, political, and economic events of 1968. A turning point for a generation coming of age and a nation engaged in war, 1968 saw the peak of the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, riots at the Democratic National Convention, Black Power demonstrations at the Summer Olympics, Feminist demonstrations at the Miss America pageant, and much more. Throughout it all, the Bay Area was at the forefront with an emerging California counterculture. Presented as an ongoing collective of historical and personal stories, the exhibition is for those who lived through it, those who’ve heard about it, and those who wonder why it matters."

The bad news is that suicide numbers and self harm in general are on the rise. 

The good news is that we can help one another to prevent them, p2p. If we know more about how spaces and ways of behaving that contribute to people around us feeling more acknowledged and recognised, more connected with others and less lonely, etc then we can contribute in little ways. Sometimes all it takes is being inspired or a little more aware of how we behave. My wild guess is that many of the people in here are already contributing towards this...would be nice to learn more about what you are doing and help spread awareness about it.

Add your project to the list?  http://pad.telecomix.org/fasjubef I found this 45 min documentary worth spending the time... it advocates a change we must make if we are to survive. If we're the next edge, this is something that must not be overlooked.

http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/04/27/universal-declaration-of-the-rights-of-mother-earth/ It is only at the very edge that you can see the center clearly. Inbetween, you need to look in at least two directions at the same time. At the center, you can only look towards the rest of the circle. "the first empirical investigation into the role of different types of enterprises in the creation of social trust." What makes the appearance of the Cultural Creatives especially timely is that our civilization is in the midst of an epochal change, caught between globalization, accelerating technologies, and a deteriorating planetary ecology. A creative minority can have enormous leverage to carry us into a new renaissance instead of a disastrous fall. “The Cultural Creatives” offers a more hopeful future and prepares us all for a transition to a new, saner, wiser, culture. Because complex problems require more knowledge than any single person  possesses,  it  is  necessary  that  all  involved stakeholders  participate,  communicate,  collaborate,  and learn  from  each other. Distances (across spatial, temporal, and  technological  dimensions)  and  diversity  (bringing stakeholders together from different cultures) are important sources for social creativity. In the first modern Olympic Games, there were no corporate sponsors and athletes paid their own fares to attend. It was social innovation par excellence. The aim was to bring athletes together as peers, across national boundaries, and build new social relationships. The idea that governments of host cities might use the Games as a tool for 'infrastructure development' was the last thing on anybody's mind. 

The first modern Olympiad was a project of civil society. A century later, the Games have been captured almost entirely by states and corporates. In London 2012, official corporate sponsor Coca Cola has insisted upon, and achieved, the removal of any corporate presence for its competitor Pepsi within the vicinity of the London Games. 

In sports-obsessed Australia, the old East German model of state-controlled elite sport management is alive and well. All Australian Olympic participants are selected by the state, and funded by the state, irrespective of whether they are the highest achievers in their chosen sport. Some no.1 performers in selected sports will not be selected by the Australian Sports Commission.

Amateurism in sport is dead at the Olympics, while sports administrators worldwide wrestle with how to encourage amateur participation at grassroots levels. 

What might be done to restore the Olympic Games to civil society? Here are a few thoughts: 

1. Remake the modern Olympiad as a festival of athletic endeavour and global friendship, without state and corporate sponsorship. Require athletes to draw on their communities and networks for financial support including the application of the burgeoning phenomenon of crowdfunding. Prohibit state funding of athletes. 

2. Restrict the awarding of medals to amateur participants. Allow professionals to participate, but award medals only to amateurs. 

3. Place a global limit on spending by host cities. The London budget is about 9bn pounds. Set the limit at 1bn. Radically cut costs by inviting community associations to host and accommodate visiting athletes.

4. Establish a parallel International Olympic Committee to excise all forms of patronage, vested financial interests, and careerism from the Olympic process and oversee a restoration of the Olympiad to civil society.

http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/12570-focus-the-absolute-state-and-the-star-chamber-are-back An innovative idea’s development and survival depends on an “ecology of organizations” that provide “venture” capital for analysis and experimentation, the vast networks of contacts and associations represent a form of social capital just as important as the community’s economic capital. In this case, both aspects of social creativity—the community resources and the network of social relations—were found to be instrumental in passing and implementing.

cc Mark Roest Steven Putter If we had automobiles in the 18th century, would the founding fathers have drafted an amendment prohibiting government from setting speed limits? No one seems to think it is an abridgment of our fundamental rights to restrict speeds in "school zones" to 20 mph, or most highways to 55 or 65 mph. Yes, these are state and not federal laws, but you are bound by the law of the state or city you are driving in. Gun laws can be reasonably made. OK, Edgers Listen up, Let’s start a worldwide movement.  You know how some people enter the expression “f*ck” when emphasize their point of view in a particular subject in social media?

What if we all simply substitute the word “frack” where we once dropped our stealth f-bombs; for example: "Frack you"; Fracked up, Fracking idiot, Get the Frack outta here, FUBAR, etc.   If it catches on, we can simulate polluting effect of Fracking on the SEO of Petrochem Stakeholders.

"7 Habits" author Stephen Covey passed away today. I want to take a moment to share my gratitude for his work and the recent impact it's made upon me.

Over the past few weeks I've been slowly working, and reworking, my way through the "7 Habits" finding new ways to integrate these lessons and principles into my life, the most profound of which has been the crafting of a personal mission statement.

This is where I'm at with it right now. It's still rough around the edges and evolving, but has already proved immensely catalytic to my growth nonetheless:

Expand the light of consciousness, presence, compassion, and love through the practice and the sharing of my gifts: singing, dancing, filmmaking, photography, storytelling, and imagination. Also to support and create radically alternative and evolutionary business structures that bring more equitable, sustainable, and valuable products/services to local and global communities, in service of a more peaceful, sustainable, and open world.

What do you think? Will you support me on this mission?

I'm curious to hear other peoples personal mission statements. If you have one please share it!

It shows that the existence of a social hierarchy in a community can be adaptive, in the sense that it helps the community to function more efficiently. That’s because the hierarchy can make it easier for any individual to get hold of useful, reliable information – where to find food, say, or how to get a plumber – without having to ask everyone."

Wasn't it the Capitalists that promised to be the best way to bring demand and offer together? Well, in the USA it most clearly failed hopelessly. Thousands of homeless, unemployed  and hungry people seek roof, work and food, and thousands of empty houses, thousands of activities that stay undone and kilos of thrown away food, clearly don't find each other. The question is, who didn't keep the promise? What went wrong? Because if the game doesn't work as intended, that rules need to be changed ;-) I'm setting up a Next Edge related new project on a server in a privacy respectful country and the Server Hosting company only takes Bitcoins.

https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=473855595961014&id=144443118902265 This article suggests that at this time of economic, social and environmental ‘melt-down’, there is a need to re-claim creativity as a social phenomenon, often resulting from human interaction across boundaries. The paper offers a bold agenda for re-qualifying the creative economy according to this fundamentally social conception, including how this can be achieved through the embedding of a new discipline of social creativity. "Despite a strong rhetoric of inclusion, both cultural and economic policies continue to reinforce the deep-seated belief that creativity is something (only) talented and artistic individuals do. This individualistic conception of creativity extends to the framing of the creative industries and the creative economy, where creativity is treated as either a quasi-commodity or the preserve of the so-called ‘creative class’. This article suggests that at this time of economic, social and environmental ‘melt-down’, there is a need to re-claim creativity as a social phenomenon, often resulting from human interaction across boundaries (e.g. across nation states, professions, industries, organisations, disciplines, social and cultural groupings, methods, epistemologies and rationalities). The paper offers a bold agenda for re-qualifying the creative economy according to this fundamentally social conception, including how this can be achieved through the embedding of a new discipline of social creativity."

But is this a good beginning?  What are the downsides?  

I think seeing this through the lens of Barry Wellman's new book on networked individualism is helpful, though I think Barry is too positive. I was at a conference the past few days called "DIY Economy". It was FANTASTIC!

Hope you'll join in. My response to a link recently posted here where David Wilcox compares Social Entreprenuership to Social Innovation.  I'm riffing on what social innovation can learn from how social entrepreneurs act in his four domains:

http://chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/?p=3646 The evolution of society, the transcendence of existing social structures, and how society creates itself rests in a function of education. In this article the author examines education’s work as that of social creativity. The need for pedagogies of “educate hope” and “imaginative possibilities” is explored. Social epistemology and social imaginary are discussed as dimensions of social creativity within the postmodern society. The aesthetic imperative in education is argued as important to developing the capacities and capabilities in youth to imagine alternative  future possibilities of democratic society. The author concludes by examining the role of education in the evolution of society. Powerful reminder for me today - hope it is for others here as well, who find themselves trying to fund an enterprise, or even just sustain it till they can fund it! this is interesting to me more for the network dynamics aspect of things, rather than this specific instance of gas prices ... i would guess that many things that look like a conspiracy are actually the result of this kind of dynamic... I'm trying to understand something which continues to puzzle me.

I constantly run into very smart people who believe social networking is core to our future and yet do not engage in conversation on Twitter.

Sure, they might have an account.

Sure, they might reply.

But they are not

Anyone have any ideas why they choose to miss out on the greatest listening tool ever devised? What could they possibly be thinking.

I'd give examples but there are so many I don't want to single anyone out since it is a class problem not an individual one. Where is the next edge for innovation?

Sharing becoming big business Knowledge sharing and creation are considered key processes leading to innovation and organizational performance. Several organizational initiatives have focused on building communities of practice in order to create a platform where employees can share experiences and insights. The focus in this paper is on one type of network structure, termed distributed networks of knowledge (DNoK). And what is the most wonderful thing that can happen when people gather? That would be serendipity. Serendipity is the emergence of desirable novelty from a chance encounter, the discovery of something wonderful, unknown and unpredictable.

"The first question this prompts is ‘why now?’According to Doug Rutzen, who runs the ICNL, it’s actually been going on for a while – “between 2005 and 2010, over 50 countries considered or enacted restrictive measures constraining civil society.  The drivers of this crackdown include the Bush Administration’s “democracy promotion” agenda combined with the decline of US soft power after the Iraq war and the human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib; the patina of political legitimacy provided by Putin and others; the sharing of “worst practices” by governments; both legitimate concerns over development effectiveness and even the unintentional support for constraints arising from the concept of “host country” ownership; and the “war on terror” paradigm, which was used to constrain civil society in the US and globally.” Part of why the economy is as it is.

http://blog.rockthepost.com/2012/05/what-does-it-take-to-create-a-great-ideapost-on-rock-the-post/ Query: does the sharing economy work in rural settings? examples and links very welcome .. Hello Next Edgers!

My name is Benjamin … this is my first time posting in this community. 

A bit about myself: I am really interested in meditation and learning more about myself. I think this is a foundation for the connection and value I hope to create. I am currently pursuing a bachelor of Knowledge Integration from the University of Waterloo, which to me is essentially an educational playground. I am close friends with Connor Scott Turland, who introduced me to this group. I spent last year living in communities in Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia. I also spent some time in an intentional community named Tamera in southern Portugal. I am currently working in Toronto, doing some work in the field of social finance. I am really interested in applying a complex systems framework on messy social and environmental problems, and am hoping to find some people who can help to clarify / challenge / build on the concept of consciousness and self awareness as emergent properties of the brain / mind / neural networks. 

Look forward to learning and growing with you! Is anyone working on projects related to shifting the emphasis from financial profit to personal/collective fulfillment? Would love to hear your thoughts about my new video... can we apply our collective knowledge about human evolution, cooperation, and innovation to make the transition to sustainability?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOEZt1vpSdQ&feature=youtu.be RADICALLY SHIFTING LIFESTYLES:  Whatever else happens on our path to a far better future, most humans will need to significantly change their lifestyle.  Beyond the obvious living sustainable (much less consumption), there will be new behavior patterns related to learning, children & elderly, relating to others with differences, and with Gaia in general.

I conjecture that it could be demonstrated that most humans will be unable to transFORM their contemporary lifestyle into an "acceptable" lifestyle, even with intervention and support. We are literally addicted to our lifestyles when in settings that reinforce those lifestyles.  I personally need what I propose.

I propose an alternative to transFORMing lifestyles. Community/Settings are established where a person can immediately be embedded in an alternative lifestyle.  Initially a person may join such a setting as one might attend a conference or go on an exotic vacation.  Most people carry part of their lifestyle with them to conferences and vacations, so that they are not usually tempted to change lifestyle.

There should be an experimental diversity of such settings. These settings should seaf a person's reeee for desiring to shift some of their life-time to the new lifestyle in the new setting.  A person may have a few alternative lifestyle setting that they alternate between as their old (unsustainable) lifestyle is phased out.
 
 seaf = support/enable/augment/facilitate
 reesee = relevant/effective/efficient/sufficient/enjoyable/elegant
 
This may start within the population of un/under-employed and those who reject "the system", but whose lifestyles are not the best (even if their ecological footprint is less than the wealthy).  The new settings should focus more on the attitude and behaviors, even when the "objective" lifestyle of the setting is not yet "pure".

Technologies need development to assist sharing and collaboration as experimental setting emerge from the relevant populations. A meta process must emerge that will not be top-down control; but will "seaf the reeee" of the individual settings. Specifically, how can the spread of this process become exponential?

This "project" should accompany a general "educational uplift" process to equip the global population with the necessary knowledge and competencies to successfully participate in the metamorphosis of humankind to humanity. This may be a prerequisite for success, and not a distant goal to be achieved after activist groups "gain power". http://economics4humanity.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/love-in-business/ Just completed this short online survey from a Schumacher College student: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/X73GWZD By completing this short survey you will help spreadthelove.org, a start-up social enterprise refine their strategy and prioritise their programming schedule.

Maybe this could be the solution? here the english and spanish version of his article
http://romerogordon.wordpress.com/ In the knowledge economy, content is no longer sufficient – everyone has access to a multitude of content. The new advantage is context – how internal and external content is interpreted, combined, made sense of, and converted to new products and services. Creating competitive context requires social capital – the ability to find, utilize and combine the skills, knowledge and experience of others, inside and outside of the organization.

"The experience of learning actively, playfully, with a sense of curiosity and surprise, was part of what made the Camp feel so alive. And it raised the question: what if our work were always (or at least more often) like that?  And why isn’t it already?  After all, Peter Senge first wrote about the “learning organization” over 20 years ago; since then, it’s been universally acknowledged as a critical factor in organizational success.

Its just such a large scale it is almost unfathomable. When people talk about high corruption vs low corruption, remember numbers which represent the annual wages, if people earned $50k. That would mean at that annual income for developed country earnngs that there are 16 billion person-years worth of wealth that is being distorted in terms of the value to citizens. Or to put it another way, if 300 million Americans worked for 50 years,  that is how much wealth is being directly affected by the Libor scandal.

Cultural-Biological Matrix of Human Living

Humberto Maturana Romesín and Ximena Dávila Yáñez
Escuela Matríztica de Santiago, Chile
http://matriztica.cl/

ABSTRACT

We proposed the notion of Cultural-Biological Matrix of Human Living (CBMHH) the year 2000 when we realized that it was not possible for us to understand humanness if we did not accept that humanness is in its very origin a cultural-biological manner of living. Manner of living that must have begun with the origin of language in an ancestral family of bipedal primates more than three million years ago, and that has been conserved from generation to generation in the learning of children as a family way living in languaging and conversations

When we speak of systems we speak of collections of elements interconnected in such a way that if we act on one we act on all. However, we usually speak of systems treating them thinking in lineal terms missing their continuous multidimensional transformation. Accordingly we propose an approach to the reflection on natural phenomena that keeps our awareness of the recursive nature of their spontaneous transformation and change.

Following this approach it is possible to see that as humanness arose in the interlacing of the bipedal primate biology with languaging and conversation in some ancestral family, humanness arose from its beginning as having an integral multidimensional biologic-cultural systemic nature in its manner of living. And it is possible to see as well that this manner of living defines as well the nature of their living in social and not social communities. 

What is social living? Social living occurs in the constitution of communities of living together held by the fundamental emotion of reciprocal acceptance, as a domain of living together in which its members become individuals, and that is at the same time the result of individual living together. In particular in human social communities the individual that integrate it become persons that as individual can reflect about their living in it, and can consciously chose to remain in it or leave it according to whether they fin themselves living in it in well-being or not. When we speak about the nature of human living we speak of the cultural-biological matrix of human existence (CBMHE).

The understanding of the systemic dynamic of the cultural-biological matrix of human existence opens the possibility of seeing both the lineal coherences of the locality in which one lives, and the systemic recursive network of the multidimensionality of the operational relations that constitute the social existence in which one’s locality occurs. 

Finally, the understanding of the CBMHE how is it that whenever something biological occurs to a human being his or cultural living changes, and whenever something cultural happens in the life of a human being, his or her biological living is affected.

It's called "eventwork", and it states that making things happen requires a fourfold matrix of theory, art, media and politics. I got this via the egs (European Graduate School) channel on YouTube.

Transcript at http://brianholmes.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/eventwork/

Given my obsession with fourfold matrices (http://paei.wikidot.com/subject-index-of-paei-models), I couldn't resist it. The intro is a bit obnoxious, but Holmes' point is that social movements involve the following four dimensions:

 - Critical research (theory)
 - Participatory art
 - Networked communications (media)
 - Collaborative coordination or “self-organization” (politics)

He adds:

"These different strands interweave, condense into gestures and events, and disperse again, creating the dynamics of the movement. A fourfold matrix replaces any single, easily definable initiative.

No doubt the complexity of this fourfold process explains the rarity of effective interventionism. But that’s the challenge of political engagement. What has to be grasped, if we want to renew our democratic culture, is the convergence of art, theory, media, and politics into a mobile force that oversteps the limits of any professional sphere or disciplinary field, while still drawing on their knowledge and technical capacities. This essay tries to develop a concept for the fourfold matrix of contemporary social movements. The name I propose for it is eventwork."

The lecture starts a bit awkwardly, but gets better as it goes on. "No matter how you drill it, using natural gas as an energy source is a smart move in the battle against global climate change and a good transition step on the road toward low-carbon energy from wind, solar and nuclear power. This is from a new study by Cornell Professor Lawrence M. Cathles, published in the most recent edition of the peer-reviewed journal Geochemistry, Geophysics and Geosystems.

From a greenhouse point of view, it would be better to replace coal electrical facilities with nuclear plants, wind farms and solar panels, but replacing them with natural gas stations will be faster, cheaper and achieve 40 percent of the low-carbon-fast benefit."

been checking out some Etsy open source clones, and other paid mall/marketplace models (agriya, kodemall, some drupal stuff)... but I start to feel my lack of true grounding in coding and development may leave me making poor decisions... could use some guidance (and potentially assistance! -- barter for now...sigh...!) appreciate any help you can offer.

Our next one is below. May Next Edgers wherever you are gather with other people who want to change the world in person. That burden shared is easier to bare. 

Dear humanistic, multi-disciplinary, extremely creative people with aspirations to change the world who happen to hike,

I'm pleased to say that we've found a time when David Hodgson, Katie Johnson and I, Bobby Fishkin can join in for a hike. Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and cadence of creativity. For our hike please arrive by 5:50pm on Tuesday July 10th at the Legion of Honor. We will then hike down to Eagle's Point and on to the Sutro Baths Cave before returning to the Legion of Honor. 

We will have a good hike. Please let us know if you will be joining so that we know to look out for you. 

You can join the google group for hiking info- http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level.

"Apollo 13 ... please come home!" ~ http://bit.ly/NloVaR is anyone else paying attention to the Facebook usage pattern shift? It seems like an expanded group consciousness communication form. The mix of images, with quotes and other text extends communication capacities in a very interesting way. Then the patterns of sharing and resharing make for very interesting meme virality (which interestingly tried to autocorrect to virility). This looks to me like the necessary platform for extended consciousness, the global brain. And right now Facebook is the primary platform for global co-consciousness (at least across much of the west). We are immersed in a new form of shared consciousness that has never previously existed.. Why I love "next edge" is that many people impacting ripples here get echoed about three to six months later in the mainstream.

Across many countries, freaked-out employees are coping with sweat-drenched nights and heart-pounding days. They’re reaching for the Xanax and piling on the work of two or three people. They’re running the risk of short-term collapse and long-term disease. The hell created by three grinding years of 8 percent-plus unemployment brings us plenty of stories of what people suffer when they lose their jobs. But what about the untold millions who live in chronic fear that tomorrow’s paycheck will be their last? Research shows that the purgatory of job insecurity may be even worse for you than unemployment.

As best as I can tell it is open for public commentary from anyone. I am linking here to the post from last week re future of employment. I stuck a comment in there.

It doesn’t just hover over it. It impedes it, it deters it and kills it. That’s its intent. It does that by design. And so, understanding what the Surveillance State, how it operates — most importantly, figuring out how to challenge it and undermine it, and subvert it — really is, I think, an absolute prerequisite to any sort of meaningful activism, to developing strategies and tactics for how to challenge state and corporate power. Sharing my new article for those interested in the broader context of crowdfunding and the new paradigm: "We are on the cusp of transitioning to a society that closes the loop on this new model. Rather than perceive ourselves as individuals with only the capacity to create or consume, what does it mean to act on the knowledge that we are, in fact, all interconnected? The missing link in this new creative paradigm is no longer understanding how we support, but why we support." A facebook hint ....

“Commons-based peer production has produced astonishing amounts of freely usable and shareable information. While that is amazing in itself, many people think that it is all, arguing that peer production flourishes in the digital realms of the Internet—and only there. This would mean that peer production could never be more than a niche phenomenon, since nobody can survive on information alone. This article challenges the conventional viewpoint, arguing that the potential of peer production extends far beyond the digital sphere into the sphere of physical production and that corresponding developments are already under way. The article contrasts the plenty of the digital world with the apparent scarcity of the physical world. It explains the difference between scarcity and limitations and why is it necessary to distinguish between different meanings of the word “plenty” when thinking about the possibility of plenty in a limited world.

The chaos of these times are reflected in so many new educational initiatives, where they embrace chaos as transformational event, like any dance or play, rather than seek domination.

Micro-fragility leads to macro-resilience." - a system that is fragile at the micro level tends to be resilient at the macro level, and if it is stable at the micro level it tends to be fragile at the macro level... "This deterioration is not evident during the good times when the dominant species, however homogeneous, appear to be performing well. Stabilisation is therefore an almost irreversible path – once the system is sufficiently homogenous, avoiding systemic collapse requires us to put the incumbent fragile players on permanent life support." here's an offer too good to refuse!

After one year, the value network model shows the expected behavior: it enables economic activities with very little dependence on financial capital. In other words, individuals with no financial capital can leverage their skills and participate in economic activities, to create and distribute value. The biggest investment in SENSORICA, by far, is in time. There is some financial investment, but negligible compared to time. We can also see that members share materials they own to facilitate R&D and product development. See the emerging picture here http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/value-reputation-roles/value-accounting ﻿ I'm not putting posters or "advertisements" (for something I believe in and do not profit from)... on The Next Edge anymore, and I repented and excluded myself for a sufficiently long period of time (I hope). So now...I will simply write something. --

What good, I ask, will "scientific progress" do us if we are all dead? Our scientists ALL SAY WE ARE IN AN ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY WITH NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT (SUCH AS THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS THAT ARE NOT PROSTITUTED TO THE GOVERNMENT OR PETROL-CHEMICAL COMPANIES). Global eco-law enforced by Earth Federation is the ONLY timely solution I can see... Please tell me why you think I'm wrong or right, if you will.
-- 50 "sovereign states" of America have done very well under a Federal government (except the civil war). But someone saId... "it should be a grass roots movement, from the ground up"! -- Well, people from small countries everywhere on our Planet WANT A GLOBAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND GIVE THEM ECONOMIC FAIRNESS! ONLY the few people in big bully countries do not want GLOBAL GOVERNMENT, and say it is "elitist" or NOT "from the ground up". The individual states of the U.S.A. have thrived very well under a unified Federal government (even though the "Presidential System" is a virtual dictatorship compared to Parliamentary Systems of government). -- Some people want to continue our old, divided, warring, non-federal World System of infantile and adolescent "rule by the biggest bully on the block" -- THE GANGSTER RULE THAT ACKNOWLEDGES NO LAW EXCEPT ITS OWN -- the "macho" or "patriarchal" System-of-violence and exploitation -- but mature people see the stupidity of this prehistoric, outdated, destructive, and suicidal system. -- (In short, how can "science progress" if everyone on the Planet is dead, as PEER REVIEWED SCIENTISTS say we soon will be -- especially with the rapidly melting permafrost in Russia that is releasing Planet-killing amounts of methane into the air, and will soon be "unstoppable" -- and many ecologists say it is "already unstoppable"? How did we get to be what we are, and what could be one next edge? http://catalystsdr.com/2012/05/designing-the-future-economy/ A future in which global collective action is effective implies ultimately that the very idea of a “development” agenda (and the implied asymmetry of power and influence between developed and developing countries) will yield to the idea of a shared “global” agenda—across nation-states that cooperate in their own interests and in the interest of shared global stability and prosperity. The creation of particular structures in the brain, the way the brain processes information, and the loss of neural connections and massive numbers of brain cells, are all part and parcel of what constitutes human thinking, learning, and minding. Our brains are programmed to learn certain things at certain times, and in certain ways. The best, most effective way to learn something is to do it as early, and as rhythmically, as possible. If we want to have an effect on behavior and learning through nurture, we have to understand better our own nature. In order to know ourselves, which has been the constant cry of philosophy – and of the arts and humanities in general – we have to know our biological selves. In doing so, we can become aware of our limitations, and of the rules that govern our behavior, so we can make better use of those rules.

It’s just not working out. 

The way that you provide support for innovation isn’t working for you, or for us. We don’t like the bureaucratic processes, high organisational requirements and over-specified funding calls - and we are sure that you don’t like administering them either. The financial and social crisis is making reform and agile innovation even more important, but processes are still slow.

We’d like to find a better way to get support and resources to innovators who can make change happen, a way that’s less bureaucratic but weeds out bad ideas by letting them fail quickly and cheaply. " I'm surprised no one here seems to be talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (trade agreement). What are your thoughts, your fears, about the TPP?

Conspiracy of Dreamers is a book about, and a vision of, humanity breathing together (conspiring) to create a future of health, justice and happiness. "What I find very interesting in these games of conditional reciprocity, direct and indirect reciprocity, we can make the point that winning strategies have the following three properties:  they must be generous, hopeful and forgiving." Just a little hint of how everything is coming together for me -- how I'm using the platforms I've built/am building to now support the incredible programming at Naropa University's Summer Writing Program (which is in desperate need of sustenance) .... and a little history of how I arrived here... 

http://lunaparker.blogspot.com/2012/06/beyond-scarcity-economy-rhizomatic.html I was curious what Next Edge thought about http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/opinion/to-save-the-euro-germany-must-leave-it.html. They appear to have made a more persuasive argument than I had anticipated, but I would be curious whether this is yall's thought as well. This post is a little different... it's a convergence of sorts. I don't intend this to be spam, it might not seem relevant at first but it is. 

http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003983500245

The three problems are, he speaks/writes English funny... but he understands it fine. (His accent is cool though), he has no network, because it was all in Serbia (in fact part of the reason he moved here was to help fulfill his vision, a big risk) and he doesn't even know where to start when it comes to creating this new, parallel, model (the 'film' sure, but the process), that would contrast the monopolization of production and be community-sourced and based. 

But he does have a beautiful vision. I share that vision. I've known him about a year now.

I've been considering adding him into the edge, but I needed a prop first. Due to those things it was kind of awkward. But it's time now. I might not add him just yet, but I do want to introduce him at least. I mentioned this as a potiencial network and that you all might be able to help.

He needs 250 votes, to get into the main competition. This group has over 2000 members. The time limit is 3-4 days. That is not even including each of your's networks.

It does not even matter if he wins one of the grants. The idea is to get critical mass and also help to make a statement. 

WE EXIST. 

 He wants to make this more than film though. He wants to create a new business model and I describe to some degree that vision based on how I see it and how he sees it as well. To some degree I am translating it, but it works for now.

So is the edge willing to help me? This is a real convergence. A chance to spark something new.

This is potiencial awesome moment of serendipity if I have ever seen it. I'm going to be sending similar messages to other relevant networks. But the edge is the most 'reliable' one. 

I will now post the link to the contest itself with the description I wrote. 

******************************************************

HOW TO VOTE is described near the bottom. It doesn't work the way you would think. It will send you in loops if you don't do it the way I describe. We need 250 votes. Extra will really really really help!

I have an ambitious and eccentric friend, named Nenad Mladenovic (He is from Serbia!) who is an aspiring director who wants to make an indie action film in Washington D.C, being 'Timeline', which he wrote. 

But he does not simply want to make a film. He wants to create create a new kind of production and business model, which is more open, linked to EPIC communities, where social barriers are no longer a problem. For both the artists (that includes the crew!) and the audiences.

What are those? Those, are, US. But he can't do it alone. 

It's about access. Resources and networks are hoarded. Ownership is overrated. 

The game is rigged, blocked, broken. Culture goes to wayside. Humans become products. Guilds, big companies, legal lockdown, 'knowing the right people', eliminates the chances to make some real art.

There is always sacrifice that comes with art, but no one should have to sacrifice their health and well-being. Or their muse. Artists can be entrepreneurs too. 

And art should do more than be made for its own sake, it should make a real difference. Real-world value. Art is not simply art, its culture and what is culture? Culture is PEOPLE. 

And people deserve more credits than they get. Pun intended. People gots skillz. Skillz add up.

Get enough skillz, people, and vision in the right place. Anything can happen. Results may vary, but expect awesome.

That is true the definitions of success. Engagement, exploration, adventures. 

This is the stuff made up of legends. Think about legends. Just think about it. 

HOW DO YOU THINK THEY BECAME LEGENDS? AUDIENCE AND PEERS HYPED THEM, PLAYED OFF THEM, LIKE SO. 

Don't underestimate the power of people. Or underdogs.

We are small now. But we will grow. Together.

Imagine... communities, (transcending the worlds of online and offline) as a studio. Fanbases which created niche brands and cool stuff. Stuff that the artists didn't even imagine. Salons where people did more than talk, they got to WORK (as well as party). 

All that and each of them vice-versa.

Artists want to be be able to create. Audiences want more than snacks and goodies. 

Audiences want to feel like there part of something, engaging more than the franchise or brand, engaging the so-called 'world', which if you think about it, is just really each other. 

What we need right now, is to find that epic EPIC community, which will generate the critical mass we need. 

(Made up of other smaller, but no less important epic communities.) 

They are the strangers you don't think about. The other dreamers. They are the people you know, but don't express that other side. 

And also be patient as we switch and configure websites, platforms, spaces for our communities, until we are up and good to go!

Wake up. That EPICNESS. It's everywhere. 

We need that critical mass. We need you. And yes, you that person who thinks they don't make a difference. 

YOU SO DO. 

We need more than actors, crew members, co-producers (that includes you to-be fans)... we need interested human beings.

The internet makes us all neighbors, e-friends, pen pals. 

Even, if we lose this, we will get something. And that will bring us closer to our goal.

Yes this is bold. Yes this brave. Yes this is crazy. 

But so what.

This is also real. This is very honest. This is quite vulnerable. 

We are nothing without you.

Who else is tired of being outcast, ignored. Forgotten.

The voting on this has a couple issues. But we are not letting that stop us. Nor do we care that this funding is through Chase, it's a starting point.

Click on that blue button.

Then in the search, where it says business DBA, type in Timeline.

Timeline should then come up with this description. It will show the amount of current votes there. It will also show the amount of votes if you click on it again. Again, we need at least 250. Again, as of today, there are only about 3-4 days.

[It's not the other one that will come up being, TIMELINE PRODUCTIONS]

Then click on that.

First of all, show pledge is a misnomer. Do not click it first. 

Then you will some social network icons, being Facebook, Twitter and Mail.

Click on those (I encourage making a new tab so you don't have to re-loop.) and then when your done feel free to press show pledge.

Then your done!!!

Please spread this to everyone you know. (Contact information is on the search/vote page, we just learned about this contest and even though there are 4 days we still think we can make enough votes to enter the competition.)

Please give us some feedback. Whether it be through Facebook or more direct. Get some energy going. No reason to wait in order to respond to us!

"Greatness from small beginnings." This is where OUR legend begins.

And we will post more and other kinds content (introduction, teasers, updates, etc) as time goes on!

Giorgio Bertini has shared a vast collection of ideas about complexity and problem solving and many of these talk about the growth of networks. Since 1994 I have been piloting uses of Geographic Information Systems to map the network of non-school tutor/mentor programs in Chicago. http://www.tutormentorprogramlocator.net/InteractiveMap.aspx and I've been trying to map the growth of my own network for the past few years.  I've had two interns working with me for the past six weeks and one has used Gephi.com to map the growth of my Ning forum from 3 people in 2007 to 417 in May 2012.  I encourage you to review the two projects that they have just completed to see how network growth might be mapped. http://michaelcnt.blogspot.com/2012/06/interns-map-growth-of-network.html Our latest article explains how entrepreneurs are risk takers and people who are able to push themselves to the limits in order to reach success.

Registration is required. www.guerrillaconsulting.eventbrite.com Yes, everything you know about economics is wrong. Dead wrong. Everything. The conclusions of economists are based on a fiction that distorts everything else. The economic profession is a genuine threat. Economics dogma is on track to destroy the world with a misleading ideology. Why? Because all economics is based on the absurd Myth of Perpetual Growth. Yes, all theories and business plans based on growth are mythological. The change in movements or mobilities of people, media, material goods, and other social phenomena, including the reach or extension of such movements, connections between “global” and “local” life, the creation of new spaces and places, and new speeds and rhythms of everyday social practice, is arguably the most important contrast between contemporary social life and that of just a decade or two ago. Despite these changes and longer conversations about their meanings in a range of disciplines, mobilities and their relations to learning within education are still under-studied and under-theorized. The present review maps current and relevant engagements with mobility and learning across conceptual and empirical studies. http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2012/06/edge-center-and-me.html Ecological Crisis or Egological Crisis

Around the world we bear witness to multitudinous crises such as economic and ecologic crises that are deeply perturbing humanity. Yet, all those crises are external manifestations of the evolutionary crisis that has risen in human consciousness, thrusting and propelling humanity to choose either an evolutionary path of integration or a devolutionary path of disintegration. This crisis is internal in nature and the responsibility lies with each and every one of us living today on the planet earth. If more of us realize the fundamentally internal nature of the crisis and our responsibility therein, and choose to traverse on the path of evolutionary integration, we will be able to pass through the crisis faster in the creation and the co-creation of a new future wherein the problems besetting today will be essentially absent.

With hypertrophied political power in governments and with “crony capitalism” on the one hand and over-politicized pseudo “ecological movement” on the other, the millennium-old “egological movement” in consciousness has come to the end. That which we require, if we are to continue our development as one human race, is a radical transformation in consciousness from the egological to the transegological which is truly holistic, integral, and ecological.

The question-challenge of whether you be on the path of evolutionary integration or on the path of devolutionary disintegration, means on which side you choose to be—on the side of the solution or on the side of the problem. If we take the current “ecological crisis” for an example, those who are on the side of the industry contaminating the environment and destroying nature and those who are on the side of the “anthropogenic global warming” (AGW) or “climate change” are BOTH on the side of the problem, caught in the moribund game of politics. “When you have only two alternatives to take, always take the third.”

While the advance of modern science and technology, and the concomitant advent of the industrial revolution, has brought forth a radically, profoundly, positive transformation in the way humanity lives on this planet (the benefit of which deserves our deep appreciation), it is also evident that the industrialization of the world brought about negative consequences internally (e.g., disconnection with nature) and externally (e.g., dislocation from nature) due to human ignorance and greed.

There are many legitimate environmental issues—such as the negative impacts of radiation caused by well-over 1,000 nuclear explosions (“experiments”) of the last 70 years, of massive deforestation of the rainforests, of contamination of air and the rivers and the oceans, and of what is called “noise pollution” in large cities (noise pollution affects our astral body and thus far more damaging to the human psyche than air or water pollution).

As it will be shown below, the environmental movement that is almost exclusively centered upon the false claims of AGW is a profoundly dishonest political hoax unworthy of the name “ecological science” or “ecological movement.” It is utterly unconscionable that the so-called environmentalists of the world let a false issue (AGW) take the center stage in ecology while give little attention to so many legitimate issues. Let us look at some facts based on real science. (continued) a critique of collaborative consumption as 'consumption only'

Multi-organization action research has largely taken the form of coalition-based processes, where diverse stakeholders have come together to explore issues of mutual concern through a centralized action research process. Less frequently, multi-organization initiatives have implemented distinct action research processes, in a coordinated manner, within each of several involved organizations. And now for something quite beautiful....   http://www.ted.com/talks/marco_tempest_the_electric_rise_and_fall_of_nikola_tesla.html Education structure is changing...... The public is suffering from an education deficit. By this I mean it exhibits a growing inability to think critically, question authority, be reflective, weigh evidence, discriminate between reasoned arguments and opinions, listen across differences and engage the mutually informing relationship between private problems and broader public issues. This growing political and cultural illiteracy is not merely a problem of the individual, one that points to simple ignorance. http://www.animalnewyork.com/2012/ill-doctrine-why-i-will-feed-the-trolls-if-i-damn-well-want-to/ I came across a really fascinating article by Bookchin today ---http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/ghost2.html. What strikes me is how he threads freedom. Basically in each age, the concept of freedom is hacked by the emergent social movement-- freedom for a different kind of entity is achieved at the expense of other kinds of freedom. Boochkin describes how adherents of Marx hacked our history of anarchism to appropriate individual freedom into a collectivist frame (co-opting the organic cooperative framework of earlier anarchists who had sought both individual and communal freedom in a more fluid balance. I was then struck  how libertarian capitalists hacked this ideal of freedom to make the story about free access to markets. I was also stuck with his analysis of how in each age it wasn't just the present politics that was dominated, but the history of freedom for diverse stakeholdrers was itself hacked by subsequent social movements. Basically, Boochkin argues that each social movement has an origin story predicated on a certain kind of freedom, and that this pattern has been recursive. I think it is interesting to apply our own human agency onto our study of the past so that we have the right relevant portions of it interpreted in ways that reflect our values- for it seems history gets hacked ever more often than it appears. A silent revolution emerges from the underground. Far from losing strength, decentralization has allowed 15-M to become ever more dynamic.

For once George Monbiot is spot on.
"You have only to see the way the United States has savaged the earth summit’s draft declaration to grasp the scale of this problem(2). The word “equitable”, the US insists, must be cleansed from the text. So must any mention of the right to food, water, health, the rule of law, gender equality and women’s empowerment. So must a clear target of preventing two degrees of global warming. So must a commitment to change “unsustainable consumption and production patterns” and to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources.

"Most significantly, the US delegation demands the removal of many of the foundations agreed by a Republican president in Rio in 1992. In particular, it has set out to purge all mention of the core principle of that earth summit: common but differentiated responsibilities(3). This means that while all countries should strive to protect the world’s resources, those with the most money and who have done the most damage should play a greater part.

"This is the government, remember, not of George W Bush but of Barack Obama. The paranoid, petty, unilateralist sabotage of international agreements continues uninterrupted.

Once in a prehistoric village, beyond the clutches of the Roman empire, a hunter lived who wasn't satisfied with his work. He lacked a passion for the hunt and secretly despised the killing he had to do for his work. He went to the shaman of his village and asked him for help. Through the help of the shaman, he found that his passion was to work with people, and help them to get in touch with their passion. So the hunter became a job coach. And in this new profession he became the most regarded of wise men in the village.  First the warriors and then the hunters found their way to his hut, because they all found they too had a disgust for murder, let alone long days alone in the wild to find food. They also had a disgust for gathering plants and berries like the women. They too wanted to be people bringing others to a higher level of existence, namely living aligned to their deepest passions. They all became coaches, trainers and job coaches. Then the makers of stuff and people who repaired roofs, found they wished to stop hammering and labouring all day, while the other men were involved in playful development and or purposeful dialogues. They too wanted to feel alive in deep connection with others. So they too went for the coaching, workshops and trainings finding their true purpose.

Now with the men at home, many women found that wandering the woods all day, picking up plants and berries, was kind of lonely work and it made your back hurt a lot. So they too went to the trainers, coaches and job coaches and found their highest passion was to work with people, to make them shine. Since there were already so many coaches, trainers and job coaches they discovered that the names for this beautiful work could be more precise and personal. So the women became workshop facilitators, personal development workers, passion finders, heart work councillors and purpose guides.

And while everyone was helping each other, in the most beautiful of ways, the children complained there was a lack of food and water. Yes, this and the lack of furniture and roof repair had the village slowly collapsing. Worried they sought council from the wisest of them all, the first job coach, who by then, had changed his professional name to entrepreneurial spirit developer. He helped them to expand business to a neighbouring village. This neighbouring village was found willing to do the hunting and food gathering in exchange for coaching and counselling. Soon the first village looked beautiful again. In exchange for food, repairs and goods, the neighbouring villages found coaching, therapy and guidance. And these people too found a higher purpose to live than the lowly excitement of the hunt or plant gathering. And the more and more people found their true passion of letting others shine and live aligned to their true purpose the more and more villages found they needed starting to sell their counselling to more and more neighbouring tribes. Food became scarce and important goods hard to obtain.

Then one day the first job coach turned entrepreneurial spirit developer found he had enough of all the talking and understanding. He went into the woods, and since he still didn't care for the hunt, he started to gather plants and berries. He felt the air, the magic of the woods and loved the sounds of nature. And when he returned to the village laden with eatables, there were many people wanted part of his pickings. They expected to get it very cheap in exchange for coaching and true purpose work. He said “no, you pay me double the price”. The whole village was shocked. That a man doing lowly woman's work dared to asked so much for such simple manual labour. The gatherer sighed. He knew they would for ever consider themselves more advanced then basic workers. So he told them he had discovered a new spiritual path called 'deep root work'. In this spiritual path people could get in touch with their own deepest nature, through the experience of the old ways, like the hunt, berry picking and or the repair of buildings. Suddenly he was regarded again as the highest of wise ones and everyone started to follow his teachings.

Soon their village flourished once again and no one was in need. Some things had changed though. There were also women who now hunted too, because they loved the thrill of the hunt. There were more men who found the work of gathering plants and berries had a deep satisfying peace to it. Others turned to repairing and making stuff with the eyes of purposeful artists. And all of them discovered that because of the deepened approaches and cool names they gave to their essential work, that they could ask the highest of prices from the neighbouring villages. Thus they became honoured for the deep contributing work to the existence of their culture. And all of them lived happily in peace and with purpose, until the Romans conquered their lands and introduced capitalism.

We needs New Work Laws. I meet so many people living in fear of losing their job and in pain because of the damage they do through their work, let alone it's meaninglessness. Here is my proposal for the first 
NEW WORK LAW: #1 No work that endangers, poisons or damages our planet should in any way be allowed and all workers in such jobs should have full help and rights to change their work and its meaning, methods and process and cannot be fired or blocked when spending time on this, until they have succeeded.
MOTIVATION: Haha, with such a law, every company must approach their processes with a very different eye. Our work laws are as dictatorial as the rule of Saddam or Assad. One protest and you get fired (read executed). Now the existence of one tribe (read company) cannot and should not take precedence over the needs of us all. Since most people comply, due to income security, they feel or think they have nothing to stand on when doing work that goes against their integrity, health of the planet or the interests of their customers. http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/stan-rhodes-on-the-role-of-money-in-the-peer-economy/2008/03/04 "In order to ascend a ladder, you must both reach for and uplift yourself to higher rungs, while also letting go of the lower ones -- the ones that previously held and supported you. Our progress upwards towards fuller realizations of our Selves is as much determined by our ability to release what no longer serves us as it is by our reaching upwards for greater expressions and experiences of Life." -- Damien Jones via Adam Gyokuzan Coutts Mark Roest   I need your recommendations as to where to create discussions on large and complex topics. What media/platform is minimally necessary for the types of dialog-to-action needed has been one of my challenges since I started using computers & cyberspace in 1982. Tools for my composition/dialog needs are not yet available - primarily because few recognize the need for the type of dialog-to-action I envision we need.

VUE, Visual Understanding Environment, has some aspects needed, like multiple types of links. But I have never learned to use VUE as it is too slow for draft composing from mind-bursts and too labor intensive for edited composing, and it is unlikely to have few users. Also, I am not aware of dialog features or what alternatives are available. From the beginning I have needed an integrated Outliner & Hypertext system - but I've not found anyone who also has that need. I view outlines as specific routes in webs. The system would be nested and networked. That Wiki can simulate an outline is not adequate. When I compose I create/navigate a fractal-like web - digging deeper and deeper, citing conditions & implications, then bounding back to meta and meta-meta levels. Recommended reading would be to first read all the top level items, then deeper and deeper levels. Making deeper outline levels Wiki links (with no hint of what the link is) is inadequate. When polishing an outline composition various other hyperlink references can be added - to be distinguished from outline levels. My earlier attempts to cobble an experimental system, using protocols, failed as I was unable to interest others - and it needed to be a collaborative effort for potential users. I speculate that without such as system certain necessary types of nested-networked conceptual schemes can't emerge in populations. Returning to VUE, a visual presentation and use of diagrams and multimedia are important; but I would be satisfied with a system that enabled others to expand & collapse an outline and have hypertext links. Currently I do most of my composing in an outliner NoteMap (for lawyers from LexisNexis), but the nested character is essentially eliminated in posting onine. Outliners in wordprocessors are an afterthought and inadequate.

Another requirement IMHO is the ability to respond to a point in a display. Years ago The Foresight Institute experimented with such a system, but it gained no traction. The Foresight instittue was the only place, to my knowledge, that saw the need for hypertext composing and communicating technologies beyond the display format of Wikipedia. For years I did my composing in hypertext until I discovered no one reads hypertext documents (to my knowledge). I occassionally used QuickTopic and QuickDoc. QuickDoc permits you to format a WORD doc so that readers can comment on any place you might designate - the easy version being at the end of each paragraph. QuickDoc enables multiple users to dialog with each other over single paragraphs. If a comment becomes long and itself needs multiple points for comment/dialog a linked QuickDoc can be made for that comment. Due to my inability to sustain dialog with QuickDoc I have not learned some of the new features, such as including photos.

My 2 months here on TheNextEdge is my first real encounter with popular social media and Facebook. I fear it only encourages jabber (which I also partake). For a few years mid last decade I was active in Omidyar.net, using its Wiki system, until it folded.

Early on I was ingrigued by Neal Larson's "knowledge annealing" concept and his (before GUI) imaginative apps and also Ten Nelson's fantasies. The recorded work of teams must become "living" Semiotic Worlds, with a continuing active process of 'time-weaving" which is more than adding & eliminating parts. There is much in our archives that is as relevant today as when posted and reference links to them may be insufficient.

Finally, the system must be sensitive to the vast individual differences in cognition in the human population, and unrecognized and very useful diversity - if our sharing systems account for it.

Mark, where do we go? I might recommend QuickDoc but all future participants would have to be invited. I am open to suggestions for a platform where better platforms can be created.

 PS on platforms. Microsoft's OneNote has considerable potential, but will require considerable learning curve to use it proficiently. It does include both hypertext and outlining, but not integrated.  I also have used ECCO-Pro since its conception, even though it was last produced in 1997.

*Sigh* A question that arose at Creating the Future's last board meeting, that has stayed with me all week. Is the world at war or at peace? I am thinking that one's perspective on this question would lead to all sorts of policy and other decisions. But try as I may, I can't find an answer... President Obama extends heartfelt congratulations of the American people to Her Majesty in honour of her Diamond Jubilee! http://ow.ly/bn0cI To Liz McLellan who asked for a translation: Hi Liz, science discovered that our belly and guts area has it's own neurological centre and network, which has its own wisdom and can influence our rational mind and emotions. It can make all kind of hormones like oxictocine and adreline. It even stores (physical) memories, like bike riding. We do have feelings in our heart science proves. 
My comment on the discovery: Well science may has discovered the facts, but for centuries actors and dancers train on developing this brain. Intuitively we know it remembers physical experiences (also trauma and loss). Fearful people walk with this brain ready to flee. Not one thought from the upper brain needed. Therapists instinctively also often speak more to this brain than the mind; if they want to be successful at the least. Too often, too many people only just speak to the upper brain. So when science says the heartbrain system can make its own decisions, i say, everyone listening to it already knew. The good news is that this offers also hope regarding your recent anger about certain men. This might lead to heart training (ooh entrepreneurial opportunity) in education and business training. Because I think we both understand that a healthy heart is more embracing and accepting than an angry, jealous and downgrading and excluding others heart. :-) happy to see fellow Next Edger Daniel Joseph Mezick has launched his new book on amazon today - The Culture Game

Rio+Social conference offered a host of inspiration for creating sustainable solutions that will ensure the future of our planet.

3 of the most inspiring statements:

“If people are inspired, they’ll create change, but if people are dis-inspired, then change will not happen,” Svensson said. “It will take action to bring Rio+20 into the future, and my worry is lack of awareness. We’re going to need systematic change.”

“In 1992 there was no Facebook, no Twitter and no Tumblr,” Ki-moon said. ” We have one planet and you have one voice. Thank you for looking at how these issues impact each other, so we can find ways to reach our common goals.”

“People think there aren’t capitalistic motivations to renewable energy innovation, but whoever solves this problem is going to be the richest person in the world,” Cashmore said. “It’s a huge opportunity offering a greater impact that Steve Jobs or Bill Gates in computing.”

9. Women Lift Each Other Out of Poverty

10. Rio+20′s Message Moves Forward Any U.S. Civil War buffs, scholars, historians, or born-and-bred U.S. Southerners care to elucidate for this eager student?

I've been doing some background research for a initiative towards the end of the summer, the ongoing memetic battle against the ideas that divide us, and those that keep some of us poor in order that others of us may be rich. 

In that research, I've been rereading various history of the 19th-century U.S. with a special emphasis on our treatment of the people who lived here before the Europeans arrived. In doing so, I am reminded of how evil our government was at this time, and of Lincoln's complicity in some of these acts. Since I am a great fan of Lincoln's Gettysburg address and suffered the typical indoctrination of those educated in the 70s, I instinctively bristle at the suggestion that Lincoln was anything but a saint, even though my intellectual side knows I should keep an open mind.

I also know that the victors write history, and often very different from what those who were beaten might have written.

So, in doing other research around the motivations for the U.S. Civil War and how the war is perceived right now by those in the South, I found the linked document which differs very greatly from what was taught to me in grade school in Illinois, the Land of Lincoln.

Knowing what I now know about industrialists and bankers, this sounds a lot more plausible to me than it would have even a few years ago. So I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can point out the flaws or errors (if any) in the rationale shown here? And if any born-and-raised Southerners could help me understand the general feeling of those in the South about the North and the Civil War, and how much anti-Yankee feelings persist.

References to books or scholarship; or just comments or pointers for where to learn more would be most appreciated.

WARNING: Don't read this if you are not open to the idea that there were other motivations besides slavery behind the war if you don't already understand this perspective. It will just piss you off and you won't be able to help me in my quest. “Good consists not in the giving of money, it consists in the loving intercourse of men. This alone is needed. Whatever may be the outcome of this, any thing will be better than the present state of things. Then let the final act of our enumerators and directors be to distribute a hundred twenty-kopek pieces to those who have no food; and this will be not a little, not so much because the hungry will have food, because the directors and enumerators will conduct themselves in a humane manner towards a hundred poor people. How are we to compute the possible results which will accrue to the balance of public morality from the fact that, instead of the sentiments of irritation, anger, and envy which we arouse by reckoning the hungry, we shall awaken in a hundred instances a sentiment of good, which will be communicated to a second and a third, and an endless wave which will thus be set in motion and flow between men? And this is a great deal.”

At a cocktail party tonight I was asked "what for-profit social enterprises have been the most successful in world history at both achieving a profitable return for shareholders and at benefiting the world? ". It is an interesting question. I was thinking of some individual product companies- Kind Bars for example, but the question came back whether any single product was really a scaled social enterprise. I responded with reference to micro-credit, but the side-effects of the for-profit socially responsible success stories have included emulators who have exploited people. So that is not an optimal response from a net-impact point of view either. I then went to Ithaca Hours as micro-capitalism enablement and the time banking movement more broadly, but as a percentage of human society this is probably less than 1000th of one percent, which is a pretty low market penetration even if it is hugely inspiring. I was thinking of Covanta and companies which make electricity out of trash, but their growth has been slow enough so that I don't know if their net social impact will be radically higher in retrospect in the future than could have been forecast many years ago.

― Thich Nhat Hanh For the Inspiring Youth series: Ta'kaia Blaney (11 years old) Thanks so much to Next Edgers for your feedback in discussing core elements of Global Citizenship for a session (which I called a "we-minar") I facilitated recently at the In2:InThinking Network Annual Forum.  As in our discussions here, the topic was most generative.  In terms of identifying some core concepts, here is what the attendees put forward; interestingly enough, there was no repetition until nearly the end of the cycle:

CULTIVATING GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP CAPACITIES (in no particular order):
1. Humility*
2. Detachment
3. Courage
4. Love
5. Curiosity/Open-mindedness/Discovery*
6. Systems Mindset/Global View
7. Experiential Knowledge
8. Equality
9. Self-Knowledge
10. Communication
11. Dialog Generation
12. Trust (vs fear of Change)
13. Mindful Awareness
14. Vulnerability
15. Flexible roles/multiple mindsets/Situational Leadership
16. Hope
17. Collaboration/Having a Win-Win Attitude Globally
18. Human Family Concept: We're All in this Together

BOTTOM-LINE: The Cultivation of Global Citizenship Capacities requires a conscious commitment based on choice; dedicated capacity-building; and humor/taking ourselves lightly (but not our work).

*Chosen by 2 groups/multiple times (very little duplication)

Thanks, again, for your own thoughts and for continuing to evolve this key topic together.
 - Lucie does anyone have suggestions for how to transform generative dialogue online into collective action in 'real life'?

i've felt so blessed the past few years to host the Emergent by Design blog, and be a part of these beautiful unfolding conversations with many of you about the kinds of people we're evolving ourselves towards, and the kinds of worlds those people are building.

i'm working on an overhaul of the site now, and want to provide a clear architecture for participation and action, for those that want to experiment with and prototype and implement these ideas. 

if you're a reader/participant in that blog community, i ask you directly - what do you want that would make your experience better/more useful?

otherwise, i appreciate any suggestions or tips for how to design the flows of attention and engagement, so that those who get excited about an idea or initiative can be directed towards the people and resources that will give them an opportunity to contribute and play.

The Singularity is Near is based on Ray Kurzweil’s New York Times bestseller book of the same title, intertwines a fast-paced documentary and drama.

The documentary features Ray Kurzweil interacting with a panoply of thinkers on the impact of exponentially expanding technologies on the nature of human life in the next half century, illustrated with cutting-edge graphics and special effects.

Also in the same context on @ eco-sTrEAMs:
Peter Diamandis, cofounder of Singularity University
After reading Ray Kurzweil’s book, The Singularity Is Near, Peter Diamandis decided to convene some of the world’s most brilliantyoung minds in the heart of Silicon Valley, give them a crash course on the fastest-changing technologies of our time, and then unleash them like smart missiles to solve the world’s biggest problems.

Why the Short-Term Outlook for the Eurozone is Bleak
5 Reasons to Be Positive!

Quoting Keynes’ famous phrase “in the long run we’re all dead”, Roubini warned that today the risk is the opposite- that we “die” in the short run. He urged policy makers to show the necessary leadership that will allow us to survive these short-term risks and so allow us to take advantage of the positive underlying long term trends.

1) The global economy is recovering

2) Success stories

3) The balance sheets of corporations are in good shape

4) Ongoing globalization

5) Technological innovation

Roubini acknowledged that the positives are all longer term trends whilst the possible downsides are all much shorter term problems. Seeing so much abuse of power can create fear of power. Learning the wise, loving use of power is the constant edge through every endeavor to change the world.

New Statesman - Dear The Internet, This Is Why You Can't Have Anything Nice  http://ow.ly/bx8SY Somewhere at the core of almost every intellectual discipline is an attempt to explain change – why and how things change, and how we negotiate these transformations.

Part of the Swift in Consciousness! A Horrible Story.

There is a land where evil wizards rule. These wizards have build very strange huge machines slowly cover most of the land. As enjoyment of their power they live in bright shining palaces that are protected with mighty spells in big bright words on top. The bigger the power of a wizard, the more huge the rituals they will have performed around their palaces. In these rituals people will sing the spell as if it safes and protects them too. It doesn't. The ones singing have since long suffered a terrible fate.
In order to keep these machinations and rituals running, for which the functions have been lost in history, they need a very specific kind of workforce. Hereto they gather all the children in the land into special temples. During dark rituals that may take years all these children are slowly strangled to death. Then they replace the bodies and brains of these children with specific programs. To mark the success of the killing all the dead children are gathered and marked with seals. Then these marked dead are put to work, according to their programming in big industrial buildings where they have to do slave labour or dance in the rituals around the palaces. Murdered children that reacted very well to the programming may be put in charge of huge ongoing rituals according to strict protocols. The most beautiful of the bodies get smiles painted on their faces and put at displays around the rituals to serve the wizards and the most expensive programs.
The wizards always fear some living may have escaped, so they test the dead, to check if they are thoroughly dead. They have to bring their parents to gathering places, where their brains will rot away, until all they can do is drool. As long as the dead don't resist delivering their parents to these rotting places the wizards trust they have done the killing well enough.

Few children escape this horrible fate. The wizards always try to make these living children surrender. And since there are so few of them alive, many of them wonder, if they are the ones missing out of live. Without the seal, they are forbidden to enter the work places. They are forbidden to play a part in the big machinations or the colourful rituals the wizards have created, for only marked ones are allowed to enter. The evil wizards will lure these children with false promises in bright colours and inviting music away from their hiding places. They make it thus that these children feel like they are near dead prisoners in a dreary world and that it's the wizards that are actually the ones offering an escape. Many will at some point surrender to the evil wizards and be killed in their temples. As punishment these dead bodies can only do manual slave labour, that waste these bodies quickly away.

Very few children escape this fate too. They feel cursed with being alive in a dying world. They see how the wizards use their machinations to strangle all live and nature too. Some of these children have the luck to meet up with other life ones. But often such groups will be discovered and infiltrated by smart programs. These programs are designed to create confusion. They will make the live children betray themselves by making too much noise, so the wizards can get them arrested and imprison them or put the through torturing programming. Or they will be filled up by evil spells that make them blind and fight each other. Others will be drugged with fluids that makes them long for programming. The most horrible fate is perhaps for those that are tricked to work hard on infiltrating the machinations. These children will mingle sometimes for years with their dead friends and to never betray themselves their brains start to rot, while their souls slowly whither away or blow up from the hurt.

The lands have been for such a long time ruled by these wizards that the worst possible things has happened. The wizards have all died and been replaced by very smart programs that don't know they are dead and blind. So these machines have no way to repent and reconsider the death of their world. They frantically keep on build ever more shining palaces amidst sterile lands devoid of meaning and live without knowing how and when to stop.

Now right before the death of their whole planet at the last possible moment, a few of the last living children may have discovered a way to shine such a light in the eyes of their dead brethren and the wizards that live may come back to them. These are the last hope of their world.

If you think this story is madness, then you belong to the dead. 
If you think it is very, very scary and perhaps even hurts, then there is a slight glimmer of hope, that you belong to the few. what if we wanted to kick off a social (r)evolution, and propose/participate in a new kind of event, one that's designed to propogate and diffuse new cultural memes, tools, and behaviors? something that can be replicated everywhere. what would we call that thing? you gotta love process work perspective :) You can view it through any of the links below.

http://www.utdallas.edu/edge/ Contemporary capitalism is in effect, if not in intent, Deleuzian. As a network of networks, it is rhizomatic, flexible, chaosmotic, evolving, expanding. In the negativist spirit that characterizes the work of the Frankfurt School, this article shows via an analysis of the government of the self, the commodification of culture and the modification of nature, how contemporary capitalism does colonize not only the life-world but also life itself. Regarded as a contemporary prophet of the new technology and economy, Kevin Kelly argues that the realms of nature and human construction are becoming one. The authors contest Kelly’s metaphysics of the new economy and technologies, arguing that he illicitly collapses technology and the economy into nature, using nature metaphors to legitimate the new forms of economy and organization. The authors argue that Kelly fails to factor in the logic of capital into his scenario and fails to explore the consequences of the new organization of economy and new technology for the environment and society. "Nostalgia is a powerful force, and a clearly effective one, but I would offer that the fact that our cultural storytellers rely so heavily upon it betrays a lack of imagination, and perhaps a fear that the future is simply not worth selling." 

Jeff Aldrich on new stories. Dearest Next Edgers I'm looking for some of that magic I see on here quite often - those gems born of your bright minds and beautiful souls. :)

I'm looking for words (in any language) or images that, for you, embody the highest potential of our existence on this planet - as human beings and global citizens.

www.facebook.com/ecoNVERGE Posting in hopes that there are some lovers of rodeo and small town America here. Apologies as it's definitely not on topic. Our very small town fairgrounds grandstands have been condemned. The rodeo is the one cultural anchor that keeps this town going - barely... We will have no rodeo and no county fair this year if we do not raise about 40K in a few days. I understand if you personally can't donate - or if rodeo isnot your thing but if you know anyone for whom this might be close to the heart - please let it out into the world! 

(I'm trying to give people a sense of the reach of the network! )

http://www.unitedcommunitypartners.org/projects/fairground-grandstands/ Ok, this is a really woo woo thing for me to share, but I've been feeling terrible the past two weeks--extreme fatigue and depression--and then this came across my radar. This makes zero sense to my logical brain and yet something in this also feels true. Anyone have experience of this they care to share? Help an exhausted, couch-bound girl out. Great talk on creativity and our misconceptions about it
http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2012/imagine-how-creativity-works Much is riding on the United Nations Rio+20 summit. Many are billing it as Plan A for Planet Earth and want leaders bound to a single international agreement to protect our life-support system and prevent a global humanitarian crisis. TREASON IN DEMOCRACY
Should "TREASON" become the primary theme of "liberals" countering the "conservative coup" underway this year?
Coincidentally, I just read an essay making this point: http://www.opednews.com/articles/Congress-The-Fine-Line-Be-by-Jillian-Barclay-120613-58.html .  Many years ago I defined treason in a democratic society to include any actions deliberately undertaken to subvert the democratic process.  This included intentional deception, manipulation of media, voter suppression, vote count hacking, severely unbalanced financial support, and legislative rule change to suppress democratic decision-making.  The situation has become much worse since I made this proposal.

For reasons mysterious, practicing liberals and progressive are unable to heed advice from those who better comprehend the political mind, such as George Lakoff, Manuel Castells (Communication Power), and more recently Jonathan Haidt in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.  Given the level of mental maturity of most populations, appeals must be made to the intuitive/emotional "Elephant" and not only to the rational/conceptual "Rider".  Haidt cites research clearly demonstrating that "conservatives" respond almost equally to FIVE moral "tastes" (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity), while liberals respond only to the first TWO.  These "tastes" are automatic, non-conscious, instantaneous setting of frames for action and thinking. They are deep in our mammalian/primate system. Exemplar: a person can be flashed a picture that triggers one of these "tastes" so briefly that they can't report what they saw; but they will correctly rate that unknown as "good" or 'bad" with great accuracy.

[GOP] TREASON ATTACKS DEMOCRACY would trigger the moral tastes of conservatives and possibly open the door to information currently blocked by liberals' exclusively conceptual messages about caring and fairness.  If anyone knows how to pass this information up to liberal/progressive pundits, please do. http://enenews.com/japanese-diplomat-it-is-speculated-that-melt-throughs-at-reactors-1-3-might-lead-to-unintended-criticality-or-steam-explosion

I just had a skype chat with DK Matai who apologises for the fact that he cannot engage on Next Edge as much as he would like, and when he does is constrained - due to the nature of his work - as to exactly what he can say.

He asked me to post the following link which paints a worrying picture.

Makes me wonder what people in this group think of Tim Flannery's argument -- that humans are forming a superorganism that will enable the Earth to protect its life support systems for the long haul.

http://fora.tv/2011/05/03/Tim_Flannery_Here_on_Earth#fullprogram Dear humanistic, multi-disciplinary, creative people with aspirations to change the world who happen to hike,

I'm pleased to say that we've found a date & time when Howard Rheingold can join David Hodgson, Katie Johnson and I, Bobby Fishkin for a hike. The date is June 14th, 2012.  Hiking is good at creating rhythms of thought, pace of mind, and cadence of creativity. For our hike, please carpool to parking near the Mountain Home Inn 810 Panoramic Highway Mill Valley, CA 94941. We will carpool to there (and from there head to the trail) and meet there at 5:30/5:40. Please carpool from San Francisco (coordinate rides in either the google group or on the Facebook event page). 

We will have a good hike from there. Please let us know if you will be joining so that we know to look out for you. 

You can join the google group for hiking info- http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level. 
You can RSVP at http://www.facebook.com/events/251880881585417/

"Instead of the standard approach of assessing an organization like a broken machine and looking for ways to fix it, imagine if we asked, 'What would move this organization’s story forward in interesting ways?'”  

http://solarium.cambiumconsulting.com/content/postcards-thrivability-camp-advancing-story What are the conditions / circumstances that create true, authentic, online engagement? I'm not sure if this is a great idea or a scary idea. It sounds great at first. I think it's something that's been missing for a long time, it's what Facebook should have been, catering to hyperlocal communities.. But then what happens when the neighborhood pedophile starts using NextDoor for evil purposes? What are your thoughts on this? Already in Canada just recently, they arrested three teenage girls who were running a child prostitution ring, and were said to use Facebook as part of their pimping routine.. They are the first underaged individuals EVER - in Canadian history - to be charged with human trafficking. So when I see Nextdoor, and it Join the free private social network for your neighborhood.. I think: Free but at what cost?  https://nextdoor.com/ Civil Society Politics - Power to the People 

Your comments are invited on this discussion paper and proposal: http://www.civilsociety.org.au/CivilSocietyPolitics.htm

"Around the world politics is in disrepute. It has become detached from society, unresponsive to its needs. It seems incapable of solving the big economic, social and environmental challenges. Public leadership remains important, but politics is everywhere discredited. 

For more than a century, political movements, governments and public policy have focussed almost exclusively on states and markets, and ignored civil society (the sphere of life that is most important for most of us, most of the time). 

Why was civil society marginalised for a century? 

a. Historically, the 20th century was the century of concentrated power (Communism, Fascism, World Wars, Big Business). Civil society is dispersed, localised, small in scale. 

b. Ideologically, the philosophies of the 20th century were individualist-collectivist (Fordism, Marxism, Nazism, Existentialism, Scientific Management, Neo-Liberalism). Civil society is relational and associational. 

c. Organisationally, labour unions and corporations were easy to organize. Before the Internet it was difficult and costly to organise the disparate components of civil society. 

In 20th Century Politics, notions of Left and Right formed a stable linear structure for politics without civil society. 

Four Features of Left and Right 

i. See the public sector or the private sector as the solution to every problem. See the imposition of state or market solutions on society as the proper business of government. 

ii. See only individuals and governments as social actors. Cannot see associations of citizens and their interactions. Do not see individualism-collectivism as flip sides of the same coin. 

iii. Serve core public and private sector constituencies (public sector employees for the Left; corporates and some professional groups for the Right). Ignore the third sector (households, associations, charities, social enterprises, cooperatives). Ignore family and small-businesses and the self-employed. 

iv. See politics as ‘management’, the execution of top-down, corporate-style administration. Use political parties as their instruments of management, based on top-down, command-and-control cultures. These parties no longer need citizens, and now comprise professional operatives, ‘career politicians’. 

What then comes after 20th Century Politics? 

Civil Society Politics seeks: 

a. Representation of civil society in politics. 
b. Policy making that strengthens civil society. 
c. Transfer of power from states and markets to civil society. 
d. Renewal of democracy by placing citizens and civil society at the centre. 

How can Civil Society Politics take the world by storm? It needs to be: 

a. A movement - which individuals may join. 
b. Global in scope - and a new political movement is needed in every country. 
c. Open to members of existing parties and members of none, including those who seek new parties based on civil society politics. 

Members in each country can network with each other and take initiatives as they see fit (including those who are members of the same political party, those who seek to form a new party or undertake electoral activity based on civil society politics). 

An online tool will be created through which individuals and groups in every country can join Civil Society Politics - Power to the People. 

An international coordinating council will be established. 

http://www.civilsociety.org.au/CivilSocietyPolitics.htm It sounds official- each human being is 1000 species (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/health/human-microbiome-project-decodes-our-100-trillion-good-bacteria.html?hp). If the moral responsibilities of collective communities are different from individual responsibilities, (they are broader ultimately in scope-- complex communities can handle the long-tail of hypothetically possible responsibilities more easily than individual people) -- does this mean that our responsibilities are different now that we represent a society of species living within our body? Does self-authorship reflect collaborative responsibility biologically and do we have a responsibility for narrative integrity that is multi-species, not just collectively but also individually? only 21 more hours left to make your vote for sustainabilty and civil rights at the Rio+20 summit. please vote and share. thank you.

http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/06/next-big-start-wave-civic-technology/2265/ Anybody here designing immersive experiences in the vein of Michelle Holliday's Thrivability Camp? Hi all ... it's been a while since I posted anything in here, as I've been working my ass off on a new strategy for w1sd0m. While we've made a lot of progress behind the scenes with discussions / agreements with networks about cross-populating data and supporting more integration, we're now at a point of needing to raise some capital.

Whether or not you choose to support in that way, if you'd like to do a 90 second video answering a few short questions and get your face, voice and project out to the world, please let me know. 

You don't have to do anything other than record your answers to some questions and promote your video on ONE day to your social network ... that's it. Want to know more? Just ask ... I just wrote this article... a call-to-action for systems thinkers wanting to build institutions for the 21st Century!

http://www.chaoticripple.com/2012/integrated-approach-to-global-change/ CORRECTION: Urging the world leaders to wake up! Stand up! And make the change happen! Our children and their children are at stake and we are lending this earth from the next generations! I wish people would REALLY listen to the message this girl brings! We have all proven ourselves once more so incapable!

This video has been going around the world with billion hits and nowhere I have seen anyone responding to what the publisher of the video said in the introduction.
It was hitting me now for a couple of days and feel I need to stand up and say how we are bad listeners! and proof our incapability of showing and exercising good leadership. This is the real proof of the trouble in our current world: there is no outspoken leadership that should start with listening. Remember the saying: "Children are not good at listening, but they imitate easily!"
So if they only learn from how and what current adults and leaders are showing them, they will become same and fail to make the change in the world.
I listened 10 time again to the girls message - 3 minutes of real value she is telling us: She doesn't ask to be or become or to be named PRESIDENT of EARTH!
Instead she is asking for the current leadership to take up their responsibility and provide for her and trillion other children an environment in which there is a future and potential for her and everyone to grow and succeed in life. Only that way her studies and motivation will contribute to a better world. Do you have the "entrepreneur brain?" http://bit.ly/vZlAJq Is #socent family friendly?

We are a capacity builder and resource provider for the triple bottom line enterprise sector. We do so through a unique model of monthly networking events with a peer to peer resource exchange.  I would love it if The Next Edge community got involved and support this effort. We launched in June of 2011 in NYC, and after one year running our local prototype of Green Breakfast Club events here in New York, we are ready to expand. Our global prototype is set to launch in London and Nairobi in fall, and we are building NYC's first center for triple bottom line entrepreneurship in the East Village.  I built a little website over the weekend to showcase it all and in preparation for doing our first capital raise.  I invite you all to participate - as attendees if you are in New York, as organizers if you'd like to bring Green Breakfast Club to your city, as investors or grant makers if you'd like to support our fundraising efforts, and as green builders. It's gonna take a village...hence the name, Village Green.

Everything from our grand vision to our business plan is now open and transparently posted on our new website. Check it out, and please join us in this endeavor - we need all the help, support and love we can get!!!

'Let the beauty that you see, be the work that you do.'  - Rumi If an unanticipated earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale had just sunk the island of Manhattan, I’d like to think that departments of geology worldwide would be feverishly reexamining their research priorities, curricula, and syllabi. But I have the impression that no such urgency is evident in the profession of economics after most of it resoundingly failed to anticipate the global meltdown of the last decade (and continuing). On the first day of June, I set out on a 100-day personal experiment in rethinking my existence as Homo Economicus, and hopefully growing a new kind of wealth within and around myself. I am chronicling as I go. 

Twelve days into it, I just wanted to send out heartfelt thanks to a few Next Edgers - e.g. Kate Michi Ettinger Mark Frazier Irma Wilson Jeff Aldrich Amy Kirschner David Hood Venessa Miemis Jordan Greenhall & Pritha RaySircar for encouraging me on this path! And much gratitude to Jean Russell for sharing her earned wisdom with me.

I hope you will enjoy my dispatches! How has sharing online or off changed your life? BoHoBusiness --- new business landscape, new thinking needed....

http://www.respectserendipity.com/?p=226 This is a movie being made by Open Source Ecology. They need our support. I highly recommend it. In this paper we rethink and reframe organizational learning in terms of organizational becoming. We see these concepts as two mutually implicating ways of exploring and simultaneously constituting the phenomena of organization. Bearing in mind that the understanding of organization is simultaneously a question of the organization of understanding, we reflect on the complex interrelation between thinking and organizing. In order to connect the processes of learning and becoming, we consider the concept of organization as space in between order and chaos. I've been watching the interpersonal "stuff" happening in this group the past few days. And given my own work, it has me wondering: whatever the Next Edge is / isn't, it will absolutely be about how we "be" as people. 

How we be with each other when we are all holding hands and singing Kumbaya together is the easy part. How we be with each other when something doesn't feel quite right (as happened here) is a whole 'nother thing entirely - and especially how we be with each other when someone does something egregious (kills, steals, rapes) - that is, in my mind, a huge piece of what the Next Edge is about. 

For me the issue is one of integrity - walking one's own talk. If we believe the Next Edge is about each of us individually and then collectively living the potential each of us has to be compassionate and wise and whole with the 7,8,9 billion of us that are about to be hanging onto this little bauble, what does that mean about how we be with each other when people act - well - like people? And how can we practice that right here now? “Austerity” never invented anything, created anything, moved anything forward... I'm leading a day of mindfulness.  This Sat 6/16 at Hub SoMa, 9am.

The deal is straight-forward: they are making a run at facebook by crafting a 'user owned' social network.  I haven't run the numbers yet, but my rough estimate is that even with a modestly sized network the userbase will own the vast majority of the shares compared to the early investors.  Those of you who know me - this is damn close to the New Network.

Its is not perfect - but has a shit ton of good features for something right off the ground (speaks well to the people behind it).  I'm going to be spending some time there and I'd love to get some of yall there as well to help me kick the tires. 

If it passes the test - perhaps we have a place where we can go to escape from faceboogle. Foucault's critique of institutions resonates stronger than ever: Chomsky + Foucault Debate  (1971) http://t.co/svDiqCUt RT @openculture Just a quick thought I had late last night. The thing I read the most about in The Next Edge has got to be SUSTAINABILITY. That led me to thinking..

1 - We have done enough talking about Sustainability here on The Next Edge. Maybe it's time we started a campaign. Not "many" different campaigns, like my personal campaign that I link to in posts, and your campaign that you link to in posts.. But one "unified" campaign, a real "orchestrated effort".

2 - I propose an experiment, I call it "Sustainability Sunday". It is Sunday in a few days.. why don't we all take some time out of our busy schedules next Sunday and contribute to a "campaign", an orchestrated effort, as I said? We could call it Sustainability Sunday and the hashtag should be something short and simple.. maybe #STNBSD or #SuSuD or #SuSuDay or just #SusDay.. The goal would be to do an orchestrated effort, a campaign.. strategic.. We just flood the "airwaves" with content about Sustainability, with real "resources", all the stuff that everyone is posting on The Next Edge, basically. So what we do is "export The Next Edge", take it to the "airwaves", and by that I mean Twitter.. (It would be a Twitter campaign, hashtag and all.. pictures and videos too, all content and resources passing through Twitter, trying to "clog the firehose with Sustainability"...

3 - We have two days more or less to prepare. I think we could start a Sustainability Sunday Group on Diigo or in a document on The Next Edge.. if anyone already has tons of links, just post them in this thread.. then people can take the links from this group and post them on Twitter on Sustainability Sunday.. with the agreed-upon hashtag (I think my ideas suck, please think of something better).

4 - Conclusion: Sustainability seems to be a pressing issue. Financial markets don't seem to be currently sustainable.. Big businesses don't currently seem to be sustainable.. Our economies, our business, our institutions, unsustainable.. Our dependence, read "Addiction" to fossil fuels, unsustainable.. Maybe a trick could be to be ironic about it.. Maybe it should be called instead "Unsustainable Sunday".. where we paint the bleakest picture possible, try to shock people into using less paper, or making some small action.. We could do it in two or three Sundays if you want, so that we'd have time to put a webpage up.. maybe a dystopian design fiction, I don't know, something fun.. But the point is that we Export The Next Edge and Mobilize on Twitter, in a synchronized, orchestrated effort.. One day of the week.. which maybe isn't exactly in the spirit of "Sustainability", you know, like maxing out our collective bandwidth, flooding the airwaves.. but I think it would get the message across.. that everyone is equally responsible for things NOT being sustainable anymore.. Those who ARE aware aren't doing enough, and there are still people NOT aware..

So that's it, I am calling for TNE to mobilize and do a Twitter campaign.. call it Unsustainable Sunday, with hashtag #UnSunday (though there is a Twitter handle @unsunday who would get tons of free press, so maybe a play on words, hashtag #unsungday, for the unsung, for Sustainable Solutions that are never praised enough..) I'd call it #GreenDay but the band too would be getting free press.... :)

http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/06/what_captures_your_attention_c.html Frameworks, part 42: Global Politicial Economy

@umairh
In case they're non obvious, let me quickly make three points about the global political economy.
1. A global slowdown is now in it's incipient stages. There are no pockets of demand of large or intense enough to sustain growth.
2. Policy-makers, used to essentially passing the buck, are almost out of options. Fiscal and monetary policy alone won't cut it.
3. This is an institutional crisis of the highest order. It will require global cooperation to redesign what we call "the economy".
4. The words "institutional crisis" are now almost mainstream. Many seem to think they mean "We need more bailouts!!". They don't.
5. "Institutional crisis" means designing economies and societies where wealth, power, and opportunity aren't in the hands of a few.
6. This lost decade doesn't have to happen. There are plenty of solutions to this "crisis". But they'd topple the status quo.
Finally. The stakes are not "austerity vs stimulus". They're "redesign the sociopathic global economy, or kiss the future goodbye".
OK, that was more than three points. I look forward to the punditocracy discussing these ideas sometime around 2016 ;)

Elaboration: I am moving to Manhattan late this August, and after a small transition period, I am looking for a unique job opportunity in the area. I like to work with ideas, prototypes, human interaction (organization to customer/client). I have a passion for and am currently building a career in music, but do not want to limit myself to that.

Question: Does anyone know of any opportunities, or good places to seek opportunities? Also, I have several contacts willing to circulate my information around the city, but I'm having trouble packaging what I want to do; they all ask for something "More Specific."

I would prefer to work for pay (minimal is okay) or the possibility of moving up to a paid position in the near future (1 year), but if the job/assignment is right I would be willing to do it as a volunteer/intern. Here is a recommendation on the commons that I submitted on behalf of the Commons Action at the UN that could be presented to governments at the Rio Summit (or rather to put the commons on the radar). I have been advised by one of the panel members (who likes the commons as an overarching action concept) that if we wanted the reco to pass, it should be part of the 10 most voted ones on the Rio Dialogues website within the next two days!

The recommendation currently has 12 votes (only submitted a few days ago) and would need over 100 to pass (this may change if other recos are boosted up by voting campaigns) which hould be reached easily if we mobilize.

Please register on the Rio Diaologue website and vote to put the commons on the agenda to drive sustainability policy and the adoption of a commons-based economy.

As you perhaps know, we have a Ning community as well, but it has remained a bit of an orphan, it has never really taken off ... I use it mostly to spread the news of announcements, that are too formal for the regular blog. But what I would like to see is that people present their own projects and initiatives in that forum ...

Can Spain bring down the Euro as it falls? Endgame begins? Is anyone else going to http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/jun/05/if-mayors-ruled-world/ tonight? I have an extra ticket if someone would like to join me as well. I have been familiarizing myself of late with the work of Pierre Bourdieu, and I'm just dying to find someone I can talk to about his work. It seems to be, thus far, that much of Bourdieu's work at this point has reached the point of self-evidence. Yet, while I see tons of people using his ideas - especially in places like The Next Edge - I have yet to find a single instance of one of those ideas being attributed to Bourdieu. With that being said, I would like to talk about the "American middle class".

I keep seeing this political ad on TV, a message apparently "endorsed by President Barack Obama", where he makes a statement or two about the "middle class". I wish I could remember the exact words used.. something perhaps about a "strong middle class". Now, just for fun, I looked up "American middle class" on Wikipedia and was struck by the following statements: "The middle classes are very influential, as they encompass the majority of voters, writers, teachers, journalists, and editors. Most societal trends in the US originate within the middle classes."

I find that very interesting. Now what I'm wondering about, and hope Bourdieu can help me, is the possibility of an underlying, "interiorized" middle class "worldview". (You could call it an ideology and I wouldn't object, in fact I'd like to talk about the work of Althusser as well, and social stratification in general.) Now, I'm not American, yet I'm not from the "middle class" either. I actually come from the so-called "lower class". That led me to wonder about how classes are defined. Anyway, lots of ground to cover.

I am mentioning this because I keep seeing/hearing the words "class struggle" and like terms being used when talking about America. I'm used to seeing/hearing the term in other circles, but now I'm seeing it appear in odd places. So I'm wondering, what do Americans think about the social classes in America? If the middle classes encompass the majority of voters, then won't political change have to come from the middle class? Are people from lower classes really less engaged politically? What are the underlying ideologies/worldviews, also the underlying behaviors, habits, lifestyles, of the middle classes in America versus the other classes? Are people in the middle classes in America happy with the way their government acts, generally speaking? If not, if they make up the majority of voters, can't they just vote for something better if they don't like it?

My last question is slightly more delicate, and could serve as a rhetorical question if need be. You, who are part of The Next Edge, whether you live in America or not, what "social class" are you a part of? In other words, what are the demographics of The Next Edge with respect to social classes? It's a tough question and I expect this thread to spark a heated debate. But being from the lower classes, I can't help myself, because I don't understand what is meant by the "class struggle in America" or why Obama wants a "strong middle class", or why Obama's message seems to be designed for middle class ears. Do politicians merely craft their messages for the middle class because they make up the majority of voters? Does that mean that what's good for the middle class is necessarily good for everyone in society? Or is that just what they say to get votes and in reality they actually cater to the higher classes? What do you think? Is it just a question of income or profession or education or is there an underlying ideological component, or maybe I dare say a "philosophical" substrate?

So please, humor us with your comments. In turn, I will try to throw in a little Bourdieu, cause I think his work is very pertinent (though it remains "sociological", and you know how that goes! i.e. not an "exact" science). :) Dear Next-Edgers - we've made a bold step today and decided to publicly announce our intentions to grow our company KS12.

In religion, one becomes an apostate when one rejects the religion into which one was born and accepts another religion. We see this same attitude in other forms of collectivism.

The traitor to one's political party is a political apostate. The traitor to one's nation is a nation apostate.

"Zurker is a member-owned application.
This means Zurker isn't owned by a select few venture capitalists who stand to make billions and billions. There is nothing wrong with the idea of venture capitalists making billions from tech investments, but in the case of a social network, the priorities get skewed.

If social networks are owned by VC's and investment banks (such as Goldman Sachs) and other investors looking purely for profit, they gradually become orientated towards one thing and one thing only: making money. How do we mine more data from the users? How do we monetize their every action? How do we get them addicted to paid apps which improve the bottom line?

It's not a bad thing for a social network to make money, but if squeezing every last penny from the user base is the abiding concern, the users aren't going to get the best possible product.
Zurker is driven by democracy. "

Family, religion, law, economy and organization are all examples of social structures. Every social structure, such as economy, has defined a set of specific social relations, which regulate and determine the actions of individuals, thus determining their behavior and thus creating a mental structure that defines the limits of the possible. Therefore, we live our lives moving within the limits of our mental structures, determined by the social relations, and we rarely realize that are just that, something virtual that exists only in our minds and that is why they are called mental structures. Changing our mental structures, by changing our social relations, we can redefine what is possible and what is not, expanding or contracting our horizons of possible."

"The Report says the main cause of future problems is the excessively short-term predominant political and economic model. “We need a system of governance that takes a more long-term view”, said Professor Randers, speaking in Rotterdam. “It is unlikely that governments will pass necessary regulation to force the markets to allocate more money into climate friendly solutions, and must not assume that markets will work for the benefit of humankind”. this enlarged my sense of reality, and helped shift some of the things we talk about from the conceptual to the real.. i strongly recommend watching this.. Last night I went to a viewing of a movie called "Seventeen Days." I was invited because our home was used as a location.  There are several reasons for pointing to the work, but as this is a discussion group I'll stick a question up front: How will viewing movies on tablet computers change things?

"Seventeen Days" is essentially a sex-ed project, remarkable that it got funding from the government in these strange political times. It's a project of the Center for Risk Perception and Communication at Carnegie Mellon University and Julie Downs. Downs and the Center are part of CMU's Department of Social and Decision Sciences which is probably of interest to many here. Luis von Ahn maybe one of the scholars whose name may ring a bell.

Perhaps one of the big reasons that Downs was able to get funding was she had created videos for an intervention strategy for sexual decision making called "What Could You Do?" Through blind trials Downs was able to show the intervention effective in influencing decision making to prevent pregnancies and STDs.    

"Seventeen Days" will also be studied for its effectiveness. 

One of the reasons for making a new movie was to make it work well with tablet computers. The movie follows a script, but at junctures in the movie viewers get to choose a decision for the actor and then view what transpires with that decision. Viewers can go back to view particular protagonists and choose the various decisions these characters make.

This sort of viewer interaction is common in video games, but seems new to me thinking of "Seventeen Days" as a "movie." I suspect that we'll see much more media produced requiring viewer interaction and I'm very curious to hear what people think such media might look like. May all beings be well, happy & peaceful. May no harm come to them. May they be free from suffering and fear. Isn't that the crux of being? Are we heading for biggest banking crisis in world history?

I would be interested to hear how this group would respond to the following, previously posted elsewhere:

A new world requires a new consciousness for its development and the development of a new consciousness parallels the development of a new language. With this in mind, I offer you a new lexicon, a (very partial) list of redefinitions of terms, the understanding and the usage of which, I posit, will orient us toward the creation of a new world:

PROPERTY (or wealth) is your life and all non-procreative derivatives of your life such as your thoughts, ideas, knowledge, skills, and all that you produce or acquire by using your thoughts, ideas, skills, and knowledge. 

FREEDOM is the societal condition in which no coercive interference with and encroachment upon anyone’s property is present, while LIBERTY is people’s inherent and unalienable right to freedom.

CAPITAL is the production of property in excess of consumption requirements, which is also in turn used for further production.

CAPITALISM (free market economy) is the societal system (or process-structure) whose mechanism is capable of completely protecting all forms of property. (The term “capitalism” has an unfortunate beginning because it was coined by its nemesis, the arch-anti-capitalist Karl Marx, whose enormous direct and indirect influence is one of the root causes of the prevailing anti-capitalist mentality.)

POLITICAL POWER is the special legal privilege of using force upon innocent people who have done no harm to anyone, and of unilaterally backing one’s decision with violence or threat thereof to encroach upon people and their properties.

POLITICS is the game of maneuvering to acquire and use political power, while government is the primary agent of political power. 

(Political power is an exceptional and exclusive privilege and power. It is the closest that the fallible, peccable, and corruptible mortals can come to possessing the omnipotence. Holding political power gives a person the illusory sense of holding the power of “God” and playing “God.” For this reason, political power is potently addictive to the corruptible human ego. Hence Lord John Acton’s oft-quoted statement (in his letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887), "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men [that is, men with political power] are almost always bad men.)

“Crony capitalism” is the symbiosis between business corporations and the political power assigned to and held by governments. (The problem of capitalism that we see in the world is not at all intrinsic to capitalism per se but it is inherent in crony capitalism.)

The future of humanity and of the world depends in an essential way on people understanding all these basic concepts (and more), encouraging the growth of capitalism (as properly understood), and completely eliminating political power from the government of society. 

(The Founders and Framers of the United States tried to MINIMIZE the political power given to the government. Today we must find a way to ERADICATE it. We must create a societal management system (“government”) without allowing the existence of any political power.)

The new leadership concept for the new world will entail that of distributed, shared, omnicentric-acentric leadership in contradistinction to the old model based on the concentric and hierarchical mindset. The question to ask is not primarily “who is our leader?” but “am I going to be one of the leaders in the new, emergent network of leadership?” It is the leadership without followership wherein every leader pursues his or her evolutionary passion and creative vision in dynamic unity and alignment inside the intersubjective field of consciousness-in-evolution.

I finally managed to get some of my reflections on Making a Living at the edge of change. Any comments you may have are much appreciarted, it would be so helpful to have real- experience based resource on this topic which is so riddled with anxiety for so many of us. The post is long so best read when you have a little time:

"It seems that several people have done, or are doing,  a combination of temporary and or freelance work to pay the bills, and creative exploration of their environment or particular obsessions such as getting a creative venture (such as a start-up), running.  Many report that it was actually their  general meanderings off the `straight and narrow´ (creative experimentation without set agendas,  side projects for “fun”,  hobbies and or volunteering as opposed to say pursuing a degree program) that lead to their generating income or initatives that generated work and or social value for their communities. How have they been doing it more precisely?  Here is a starting list- feel free to add more!"

'The progressive reduction of the optimal scale of production, which is the origin of the crisis, but also of the viability of the p2p alternatives, generates an inevitable conceptual tension between the universal nature of the commons and the local character of a growing part of production physical and distribution."

Radical in the sense that the solutions could help billions of people. Radical in the sense that the audaciousness of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction. And radical in the sense that there is some real technology breakthrough on the horizon to give us all hope that these ideas could really be brought to life. 

This combination of things - a huge problem to solve, a radical solution for solving it, and the breakthrough technology to make it happen - is the essence of a moonshot. 

Solve for X is intended to be a forum to encourage and amplify technology-based moonshot thinking and teamwork. This forum started with a small face-to-face event co-hosted by Astro Teller, Megan Smith, and Eric Schmidt - the Solve for X talks are now being posted here on this site.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PzSXTWhBUD0 Is crowdfunding an viable option for companies looking to grow internationally? http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3556017143 It has been awhile, I have learned a lot and now being wiser, I decided to 'reboot' my efforts into designing,making, and imagining the glass bead game. 

I of course, use the internet as a great content resource, but I also was thinking I could use some physical books to  to accompany online articles, and texts.

I then decided to go to my local library, I had not gone for awhile because I had exhausted it (and its network of libraries, that I could also get books from) as a resource... after reading books of all subjects, for years.

I realized that all this network of libraries had were popular fiction and popular nonfiction. 

The other books that could of been useful were, technical books/thesaurus/dictionaries/state law books that were archaic. The search engine and database is also a pain and outdated.

I would like to be 'well-read', but not for its own sake. I want to be able to use the content I digest as sources and praxis to help me scale and build this idea and project (as well as others.

I can't and have not been able go to my community college library at the moment, because my car is currently immobile. I will not be able to get it fixed for about 3 months, when my dad gets back from Korea. So there is nothing I can do about it. 

 Even then my college library, only had books that would relate to courses, effectively policing the content, for the sake of legitimizing their classes. 

Then if I could cite sources, it normally has to be done through the standards of the establishments, meaning that it must be filtered through an outside agenda. Being part of the edge, I want the bibliographic methods to be an expression of the new paradigm.

Not simply MLA, APA, Chicago, Etc... something like creative commons... an 'edge' commons... using some new vision of copyleft that is more based on sharing, gathering tribes and connections, more based on access, than ownership.

Libraries could also be integrated with ultramodern media and tools, becoming a literally augmented reality and open source center of the transcommunities.

So in short, this ticked me off. I really want to learn. I have been through a lot in my lifetime, especially this year and have been hysterical and neurotic, so all I could do is spend my time and energy on self-care and establishing relationships/connections... 

I hate when I feel like my talents/gifts go to waste. I want to be productive, I want to collaborate with others, and I want to CREATE. I don't care about mistakes, I just want to know I manifested something out of praxis, a project of some kind, that others can interact with or 'recept'.  (as in reception)

But I do understand that theories/visions/brainchilds take time, are rhizomes which get lost and found again, unbecome, and reincarnate in a new form.... with spiritual successors, innovation models which add to the wisdom of a group, circle, or humanity.

I got some sci-fi books for entertainment, but that is what I felt that whole network of libraries is/was (and I have been to a lot of ones in my country, there all the same, some bigger than others, but same format)  was just there to entertain, or to pretend I am learning something.

There is a lot of content I have gathered, bookmarked, over the years. It's also nice having a group like this where other people can recommend other works, or even share them, if they have written them or they are free. 

I have a quirk when it comes to buying books as well... because of the critiques which are mostly more noise than signal and the monopoly of the book companies. 

And when buying a book I want to know its going to be of real value and will not waste my time.

 I don't care if books are cheaper than movies... I will be annoyed if a book sucks, just like a movie. I am wary when buying either one.

So I guess I posted this because I have three main points. 

What is a 'library' and how can be used in a NE-modeled/emergent/open source/life portal/'accessible' community?  (as compared to one where its top down)

How can we free content, curate it better, and create a new edge-standard/collection for citations, research (whether macro or micro), 'official' publications and sharing w/access? 

How can we create transcommunities, with  members, tourists, or visitors, based on rhizomes and praxis, creating relationships with each other and the content, with a recursive form of order, a paradigmatic-structure and interface, that leads to smoother integration and communicative/spontaneous/cultivated, group and tribal collaborations?

Bank runs are in progress & large multinationals are converting their capital from Euros to USD on a nightly basis. Countries controlled by corporations (including their precious "military industrial complexes") want to block Internet free speech all over the world -- to hide their crimes against life. "We The People" of the Planet can only STOP censorship (by countless countries that claim "national security" and have secret agencies to eliminate all "enemies"), through world unity under democratic law! An Earth Federation government, created by "We The People", will BAN all corporations from any voice in Earth Federation government. "We The People" will make the laws -- actually FREEING billions of people (such as in China and many other totalitarian countries) to actually have FREE SPEECH! -- "We The People" will act fairly and responsibly to save the Planet -- but we cannot do so as long as we are divided into 192 competing, conflicting, corporate-controlled and militarized countries that claim "national security" for shutting people up. 'We’re in a situation of total emergency, the worst crisis we have ever lived through!' ex-PM Felipe Gonzalez; We ignore Spain at our peril? I'm preparing to share a panel at the Givewell NonProfit Forum in Brisbane this afternoon. I wrote this piece about modernising the for-benefit sector as a provocation in advance. "The problem, in a nutshell, is this: The old economic model has utterly failed us. It has destroyed our communities, our democracy, our economic security, and the planet we live on. The old industrial-age systems – state communism, fascism, free-market capitalism – have all let us down hard, and growing numbers of us understand that going back there isn’t an option.

But we also know that transitioning to some kind of a new economy – and, probably, a new governing model to match – will be a civilization-wrenching process. We’re having to reverse deep and ancient assumptions about how we allocate goods, labor, money, and power on a rapidly shrinking, endangered, complex, and ever more populated planet. We are bolding taking the global economy – and all seven billion souls who depend on it – where no economy has ever gone before.

Right now, all we have to guide us forward are an emerging set of new values and imperatives. The new system can’t incentivize economic growth for its own sake, or let monopolies form and flourish. It should be as democratic as possible, but with strong mechanisms in place that protect the common wealth and the common good. It needs to put true costs to things, and hold people accountable for their actions. Above all, it needs to be rooted in the deep satisfactions – community, nature, family, health, creativity – that have been the source of real human happiness for most of our species’ history." Remembering the advice of a dear friend with cancer: 1. Be grateful for every new & healthy day 2. Prioritise each day as if it was the last "The planet is sick. We are the disease. We do not seem to know what to do. We want to help. We know right from wrong. Creator gave us a conscience and a spirit but we are peaceful by nature so we tend to go with the flow. Only this flow is killing the planet. Try talking about that with a friend, you’ll get a blank or dismissive stare. A few corporations have succeeded in capturing the greater part of the earth’s resources and are now riding out the remainder of their power and influence which will last for at least a generation to come if it can downpress the Occupiers. The movement is not losing steam, it just lost sporadic violent occurrences that mainstream could sensationalize. We are fixated on the GOP presidential search bloopers at the moment.

"The 99% no longer wants to exist at the whim of the billionaires; we no longer want our vote and our voice to be completely drowned out by a billionaire donating 100 million dollars to any political candidate, all but buying an office. That’s just sad and laughable at the same time.

Thanks Lori Kane for the kind invite. First, reading the archive :) I didn't find this article so interesting but was intrigued by this quote: 

"In the end, philanthropy wants the wrong thing.  It may think that it ought to want what the lovers-of-nature want, but its actions reveal that, come what may, it loves other things first: the maintenance of its privileges, the survival of its self-identity, and the stability of the social and economic systems that made it possible in the first place." 

Which makes me wonder: Can there be such a thing as a revolutionary philanthropist, a kind that would actually not seek to preserve its self-identity? Please welcome Bas de Baar to The Next Edge.

See that pause in his story where collective laughter occurs? That’s where it happened. That is laughter of shared self recognition. Nothing in this life makes me happier.

I was touched at the depth of trust and honesty that our conversation started with. It made me excited to see what would come out of our conversation next and curious about how our paths may cross again. “We are on the same journey.” I thought, “We have different talents yet we’re doing exactly the same thing. I’m not alone.” http://differentworkbook.com/Hodgson.html The emerging paradigm of collaborative networked organizations (CNOs), or simply collaborative networks, represents a dynamic and multidisciplinary research and development area for which a number of research results are available from many international and national projects. A large number of practical application experiments and pilot cases also provide evidence on what works and what still remains as a challenge for CNOs. Friends on the edge, I've just completed a new video for the Commons Economy Rising crowdfunding campaign. This is the single most important thing I have ever produced or participated in. Recently in London UK, 12 seminars were organized by George Pór and the School of Commoning discussing the emergence of a commons-based economy.  I made this video to support the crowdfunding campaign for this initiative because I think it's one of the brightest hopes for our collective future. Finally, solutions are emerging about how to leave a planet that has hope and life for our children. I sincerely hope that you'll watch the video, and spread it around. Connor

Thank you so much for your help in advance! Much Love!! I would like to invite participants in this group to join us for an intensive two days of reflection and exploration of strategies for a new social and economic paradigm on 9-10 July in Berlin, Germany. 

This event, in partnership with Social Innovation Europe, is not an academic or industry conference. It is a two day strategy workshop, designed to generate strategic initiatives at local, national and international levels, for empowering civil society and reconfiguring state and markets. 

We are interested in questions such as: 

How can the formation of community, locality, and belonging be facilitated to produce creative communities based on real and sustainable relationships? 

What is the movement for a New Economy? What forms will it take? 

Where are new forms of social leadership emerging to guide the development of a new social, economic and political paradigm? 

Is there a New Politics being born around the world? 

What is the place of design, culture and technology in movements for social change? 

Ezio Manzini, of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, will guide the deliberations with his opening address on "Creative communities and sustainable qualities: How social innovation is proposing new ideas of time, place, work and economy. And what design can do with/for them." 

The program is available at http://www.civilsociety.org.au/NewParadigmProgram.htm

Offenders like to hide behind others and ensure their chance to sabotage. Using other people has become a rite of passage. 

Oftentimes, more than I would like to admit, people do this to others and they do not even realize it. Making certain situations all the more twisted, because the victims life is being invaded, instead of shared.

Bauman Professor of Political-Economy at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative. He is weaving so many pieces of complexity together of this amazing evolutionary switch we are undergoing; "Driving the movement’s steady build-up, day by day, year by year, is the growing economic and social pain millions of Americans now experience in their own lives—and a sense that something fundamental is wrong. The New Economy Movement speaks to this reality, and just possibly, despite all the obstacles—as with the civil rights, feminist, environmental and so many other earlier historic movements—it, too, will overcome. If so, the integrity of its goals and the practicality of its developmental work may allow it to help establish foundations for the next great progressive era of American history. It is already adding positive vision and practical change to everyday life."The Rise of the New Economy Movement by Gar Alperovitz — YES! Magazine

If you could give your self six mintues for quiet & reflection ~ I invite you to spend there time here with David Whyte's articulation of Rilke's Swan - a great way to honor yourself & nature this #EarthDay2012

The Swan
This laboring through what is still undone, as though, legs bound, we hobbled along the way, is like the akward walking of the swan. And dying-to let go, no longer feel the solid ground we stand on every day- is like anxious letting himself fall into waters, which receive him gently and which, as though with reverence and joy, draw back past him in streams on either side; while, infinitely silent and aware, in his full majesty and ever more indifferent, he condescends to glide. On this day, Earth Day ... let us remember, we are just parts of the whole, part of "One World." ~ http://t.co/B9TeV030 A personal story... Whatever is rightly done, however humble, is noble! Quidvis recte factum quamvis humile praeclarum! http://ow.ly/ar7PK How do you design for a sustainable civic sphere? A few thoughts prompted by growing up and living in Letchworth the first Garden City: http://www.no-straight-lines.com/blog/letchworth-the-model-community-in-david-camerons-big-society/ Want to learn social enterprises?

For information please contact socialeconomy@itcilo.org. In the meantime, you may want to download this Social and Solidarity Economy Reader 2011 (English). French and Spanish versions are likewise available. I wrote this the other day in a context that is no longer relevant. Nonetheless, I think the words still have ripe meaning and that Next Edge folks might appreciate them: 

It doesn't just seem simple. It is simple. Life is simple. That is the beauty of it. Narratives define the relevance if antagonistic complexity and the centrality of that which is beautifully simple to us, that which in our universe has become tame to us. There is that which gives us each kind of strength we need or wish for, and there is that in the world and our world we would do with that capacity if we could. Life is that simple, thankfully. 

Between all human beings on the planet. "Being the change you wish to see in the world"-- microcosm and microcosm should model one another for humanity's definition to not be devalued. Art is creating a narrative that is infinitely local and profoundly global. The import from good micro and export to all macros business of being human

Invest in and become emotionally involved in the narratives that can pay you dividends. Have a narrative for every discipline you care about, every person that you care about, every part of your body, every part of yourself, every idea you bring into this world, imagine the  world as it would be without your presence, then imagine if you had infinite love and finite time. Identify an infinite variety of possible quests that relate to the narrative of each, define your diversification strategy so that you seek returns of the right forms of meaning for who you are and who you wish to become,  and review the top pages of that list prioritized by feasibility and your own constraints. Redesign iteratively until the parts of yourself symphonically agree that having ant specific implication in your world would be an act of art worthy of the identity you would wish to gift yourself. Always be complicit in the feasibility of utopia's accessibility for the citizens of the world and in particular for those you care about. Know the degree you care about them. Have the right exchange rate within the gift economy of the universe and the people in your life- not transactionally but relationally-  so that you can honor all with the economic balance of justice and truth in trade in life.

Leave everything you care about better off to the degree to which it is in your life as a matter of art, the grace of only being traceable by our love and not by the degree to which we are a burden to our world. Be visible only in the love we create in our world so that when we look in the mirror if we see what the world sees than all we will see is love. Speak our truth in all the languages we know so that the parts of our soul that don't understand English are nonetheless supportive of our life. Learn more languages for truth telling. Learn more truth to tell. Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing, there is a field; I'll meet you there! - Rumi What is Nonduality? Philosophical, spiritual & scientific understanding of non-separation and fundamental intrinsic Oneness: Essence of All! "For generations, our resources have been under assault from global market forces, regional and national policy development, and inadequate legal recognition of common property rights. We are now recognizing that the benefits of perpetual economic growth are not compensating for the vast damages and risks they create — from insecurity, global warming, ecological degradation and species loss to hunger, poverty, debt and financial meltdown. We’re also realizing that neither the private sphere nor government provision and distribution — which created these problems to begin with — are capable of solving them." (James Quilligan)

The next edge of humankind's socio-economic evolution is transcending the duopoly of the Market State. The rising of the commons, the emblem of a sharing economy points the way out of the unending crises we inherited, courtesy of the duopoly. With a bunch commoner friends, we're moving the the commons into the forefront of public discussion. If you want to help, or even if you're only curious, visit our crowdfunding site:

http://www.meetup.com/School-of-Commoning-Events/events/61528212/ For longer than I care to mention, I've been writing a piece on the sociological influences on leadership called "Leadership in the Time of Liminality: A Performance Perspective for Navigating an Emerging Future." Within social theory, there is this notion of "performance" as an unconscious acting out of socially prescribed norms related to power (Judith Butler and Michel Foucault are a big part of that thinking). With that in mind, here's my general thesis:

By realizing leadership's constraining role as a performative gesture, we can disengage from leadership's unintended inhibitions on creativity and innovation. Instead, leadership can be re-scripted as a generative process that facilitates emergence through the exploration of individual and cultural liminality.

Without a doubt, it's a bit abstract (what social theory class isn't?) but I'd curious what the group's thoughts are on the general concepts.

The Moment ~ Margaret Atwood
The moment when, after many years of hard work and a long voyage you stand in the centre of your room, house, half-acre, square mile, island, country, knowing at last how you got there, and say, I own this, is the same moment when the trees unloose their soft arms from around you, the birds take back their language, the cliffs fissure and collapse, the air moves back from you like a wave and you can't breathe. No, they whisper. You own nothing. You were a visitor, time after time climbing the hill, planting the flag, proclaiming. We never belonged to you. You never found us. It was always the other way round.

A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool! - Shakespeare The future is not vertical, it is non-linear ht.ly/aqLow explained here ht.ly/aqLpa though this is positioned as a internet / digital story it is really a story about power and people and what we the 99% want. Good ideas alter the balance of power in relationships That's why good ideas are almost always resisted. Just fight through the resistance! Wisdom over smartness? By all means let us try to be as smart as we can, yet remember that it is always better to be wise than to be smart!

Find empty lots and descend on them with people from your community, seeds/seedlings, soil, and tools for planting. Explain that you plan to farm to feed the people - the children, the hungry, the poor, the homeless, yourselves -- and that until someone needs the lot, you're not going anywhere.

By teaching them to adapt, to deal with change, to be prepared for anything by not preparing them for anything specific. This requires an entirely different approach to child-rearing and education. It means leaving our old ideas at the door, and reinventing everything. We homeschool our kids — more accurately, we unschool them. We are teaching them to learn on their own, without us handing knowledge down to them and testing them on that knowledge. FARM-SCALE PERMACULTURE DESIGN: Still space left! Register soon!

Really important stuff for our times. It made me think about the role  of complexity and future thinkers with in addressing the the very real and pressing problems we now have. 

No argument that the development of new systems is critical but do we--as forward thinkers--have an obligation to contribute the our current, so called, "broken system" in order to bring immediate relief to those now suffering. (And if so, what do we do?) 

I think we do. But I'm interested in what others here believe.

New post: http://cocreatr.typepad.com/everyone_is_a_beginner_or/2012/04/medical-matrix.html The current model of classroom-based public education is simply a dead woman walking. Teachers are going to have to reinvent themselves because children aren’t going to be lectured to anymore day after dreary day. They won’t allow it. Parents won’t allow it. For the one single reason that they don’t have to anymore. Instead, more and more children are going to be reading and writing and talking about the world of knowledge they’re exploring. Intelligently. Becoming ever more educated while spending a much greater portion of their day doing what kids want to do. Sparked by a conversation with David Hodgson:

What if we released the imaginal cells of humanity from the burden of ‘having to make a living’ and release their full creative potential to focus on the very thing they were born to create here and now?

How would this impact the cultural shift that’s happening around the world? the emergence of a brave new world?

What if there was an online platform to fund these imaginal cells on long term rather than short-term project-based crowdfunding model? Crowdfunding for life or for a chunk of time. If the imaginal cells were free to create the beautiful butterfly without having to spend their energy on anything else, I say, the emergence of the new will quicken.

The rule of the last inch 
from Solzhenitsyn, The First Circle
"Now listen to the rule of the last inch. The realm of the last inch. The job is almost finished, the goal almost attained, everything possible seems to have been achieved, every difficulty overcome - and yet the quality is just not there. The work needs more finish, perhaps further research. In that moment of weariness and self-satisfaction, the temptation is greatest to give up, not to strive for the peak of quality. That's the realm of the last inch - here the work is very, very complex but it's also particularly valuable because it's done with the most perfect means. The rule of the last inch is simply this - not to leave it undone. And not to put it off - because otherwise your mind loses touch with that realm. And not to mind how much time you spend on it, because the aim is not to finish the job quickly, but to reach perfection. " Manifesting in Physical Space: 

the thread begun by Phil Jones, which led to the notion that perhaps we can begin in earnest to create a physicalized system of next edge events and geographic nodes, will ultimately rely on the creation of a contact database that organizes and divides our information by geographic region, so that we can begin to create localized networks.

once we've established local and regional nodes, we can do independent events as well as concurrent ones around a theme that can be streamed/made available to each other online (a la TEDx) 

Phil mentioned that some might have privacy concerns, but I am hoping that within the Next Edge there is trust -- this isn't to be a public list, but one established within and for this community. We shouldn't be inviting anyone in who there would be any question as to their trustworthiness, and a necessary step in diving over and into this Edge is trusting each other's trust, within this network. 

I'm not sure if this is the best way to begin, but for now I created a google doc divided first by continent, then by country, and then by smaller geographical boundaries... assuming that the best way to begin is simply... TO BEGIN. 

**the link is private by invite only. in terms of privacy concerns, also: no phone number, no street address. only public domain contact info necessary. this is about geography. this list is for the sole use of the next edge!!!**

http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2012/04/intellectual-ritual.html For those worried about China... The process of liquidating social and natural capital is called "development." Clearly, our conception of sustainable development is begging for scrutiny. http://www.realitysandwich.com/un_summit_coal_pile_ballroom "Sociology studies the social interactions of humans (which may be the same as saying sociology studies humans). Sociology is typically understood to be its own area of study, but I am increasingly convinced that sociology ought to be understood to be a metadiscipline that covers disciplines such as economics, the sociology of science, the sociology of artistic production, etc. Another way of looking at it, sociology should be understood to cover the market economy, the gift economies, the political economy, and the divine economy, as well as the interactions of those economies. As such, sociology is the study of spontaneous orders. Or should be."

http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2012/04/interaction-rituals.html A sentiment that goes with some of the other posts in this group. So how do we move from a great cast to a cool plot?

"Here are some of the many examples of how economic growth policies directly destroy the essentials of happiness. Economic growth turns social reciprocity and gift relationships (two components of GNH) into paid services. It converts pristine ecosystems into sources of timber or minerals. It converts silence into noise, starry skies into urban lights, kitchen gardens into supermarket purchases, mom's cooking into fast food takeout. It replaces the village storyteller with the TV cartoon, mothering with day care, outdoor play with video games. ..." http://socialfinance.ca/blog/post/proving-the-model-5-lessons-for-social-ventures-searching-for-seed-funding http://idea.usaid.gov/div/IFA I was struck a couple of years ago by the direction we seemed to be heading toward with a more social economy and the metaphor which Leo Tolstoy had found in a story delivered by an elder brother: http://www.ecademy.com/node.php?id=142413 In his article "Blueprint for P2P Society: The Partner State & Ethical Economy" Michel Bauwens describes "a model where the democratic civic sphere, productive commons, and a vibrant market can co-exist for mutual benefit:

*At the core of value creation are various commons, where the innovations are deposited for all humanity to share and to build on
*These commons are enabled and protected through nonprofit civic associations, with as national equivalent the Partner State, which empowers and enables that social production
*Around the commons emerges a vibrant commons-oriented economy undertaken by different kinds of ethical companies, whose legal structures ties them to the values and goals of the commons communities, and not absentee and private shareholders intent of maximising profit at any cost

Where the three circles intersect there are the citizens deciding on the optimal shape of their provisioning systems.

This model can exist as a submodel within capitalism, and partially already does so in the present system, as the open source software business ecology. It could also become, with some necessary hacks, the core logic of a new civilization."

How do you see this taking shape? And how can we change agents of the next edge help accelerate the process?

http://www.shareable.net/blog/a-blueprint-for-p2p-institutions-the-partner-state-and-the-ethical-economy-0 HOW EFFCIENET ARE WE ?
 The primary theme of French futurist Jacques Ellul's analysis of technological society [his master trilogy: The Technological Society, Public Illusion, Propaganda] was how making a god out of efficiency doomed society to endless problems. 
 Although efficiency continues to be a primary driver towards profit maximization among corporations, we might discover that anti-establishment persons and movements may have shifted to the opposite extreme. Do we still live in fear of a narrow view of efficiency as robotic "time & motion" regimentation (Taylorism)? We might re-consider efficiency as making the best use of our time and resources, self generated.
 A while back I invented a 5-dimensional vector term for evaluating action, with the acronym: REEEE: Relevant, Effecive, Efficient, Enjoyable, Elegant.  Whenever I consider improving action I consider all five dimensions.
 We might be more encouraged about our potentials if we discover how very inefficient we really are and how our efficiency (the whole of REEEE) can be increased orders of magnitude.  But, first we need to be honest in evaluating our personal and collective efficiencies.
 Personally, I am less than one percent efficient.  My inefficiency comes from three domains. 1) addiction to lifestyle and social network that consumes 90% of my waking moments; 2) that all of what I can most contribute by doing requires considerable seafing (support, enable, augment, facilitate);  which I have been unable to attract; 3) my lack of strategic effort to improve my competencies (in spite of my deep interest in learning & organization).  There are many activists who don't have a problem with my (1) problem; who are working themselves to a frazzle and bone.  Might we be, in spite of our talk about collectives, still too deep in cultures of individualism?
 Seymour Sarason's reseach into movements in the 1960's concluded that most were so busy doing-the-cause that they gave little attention to how they were doing and how their doing might be improved. Most movements either withered away and died or ossified into formal instutitions of little relevance.  IMHO this has been the fate of movements in all decades since.  My take on this is that quality collaboration/synergy won't occur "naturally" because activists' attention is captured by their doing and they have neither intention or interest to devote to serious change (of themselves, not what change they attempt to impose on others).  My solution is not to expect dedicated activists to initiate contacts, but that a new human enterprize, a seafing network, serves as an enzymatic accelerator for human social action - amplifying the reeee of all action. This above all: to thine ownself be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man. -- Shakespeare Dear esteemed colleagues - can you give me your opinion on this effort? 
I recognize a few names...

https://www.calyxinstitute.org/about/advisory_board Tokyo Decides to Prevent Crime With Mood Lighting
Nearly every city in the world wishes it could flip a magic switch that would cut down on crime, and only one city has a switch that turns on the Bat Signal. The city of Tokyo, however, had heard a rumor that you could cut down on crime with a little bit of mood lighting -- specifically, by turning the street lights blue.

The Tokyo prefectures where the blue lights were installed saw a 9 percent decrease in crime. You can write that off to a statistical anomaly if you want (maybe that was the same month they also brought on the RoboCops), but Glasgow, Scotland, saw the exact same result. Glasgow wasn't trying to bring down crime when they installed theirs, they just thought it would make the city look better. Then somebody noticed that crime had gone down right after, and the only thing they had changed was the stupid blue lights

Next, the Tokyo railroad decided to get in on the blue-light action, though the problem they wanted to solve wasn't so much the crime. Their main concern was the train-assisted suicides that were taking place in their stations. The result after the blue lights were installed? Suicides dropped down to zero.

There are several theories. First, there's the fact that science has observed for decades that blue is a calming color, as opposed to such "Let's raid shit!" colors such as yellow or red. But there's also another theory, which is that blue is the universal color of "Holy shit! Cops!" and the blanket of blue keeps people on their best behavior because they subconsciously feel that they might be busted by the cheese at any time. Others say just the fact that there was a change at all may have made criminals uneasy -- the fact that the lights had been installed implied that somebody was paying attention.
Either way, it appears that the illusion that Big Blue Brother is watching you at all times is subconsciously enough to keep you honest and law-abiding. And all because of Officer Light Bulb.

"The birth of the era of mass production, based on economies of scale, which is now ending, was when Ford instituted the Assembly line. The birth of the era of physical peer production, based on economies of scope, occured thanks to the convergence of Marcin Jakubowski’s Open Source Ecology, an integrated set of openly designed machines that can sustain a ‘Global Village’; and Wikispeed’s pioneering use of distributed software development techniques, to the production of the Wikispeed open source car.

Like the invention of Bitcoin as a first workable post-Westphalian currency, this is another seminal moment in the transition to a peer to peer society." Searching and achieving well-being!

http://oldnewnow.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/cloudfunded-a-story-from-the-shipping-lane Hey Next Edgers, 

A new blog post. (Really trying to get more reliable with all this).
Looking forward to any thoughts or comments.

http://gonnagrowwings.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/conflict-process-and-the-self-in-organizations-and-large-social-systems-some-tentative-thoughts/ Carmen Medina made this excellent recommendation this morning, which I second. Do listen if you're serious about creativity at the individual and ecosystemic levels. Jordan Greenhall - Jonah's cognitive style feels very similar to yours... So just took a look at the Buddhist space in SF that is coming onto the rental market. Very good energy. Could indeed make a good superhero school / social innovator co-live space. Came across these words by Martin Luther King Jr. from A Time to Break Silence where he called for the end of the Vietnam War today. Tragic how they apply to our times. Not just about war, but about Western elite educated apathy for the plight of the poor and all those dying because we spend so much on war:

This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing -- embracing and unconditional love for all mankind. This oft misunderstood, this oft misinterpreted concept, so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate -- ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John: "Let us love one another, for love is God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love." "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us."4 Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day.

We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says:

Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word (unquote).

We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at flood -- it ebbs. We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, "Too late." There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect. Omar Khayyam is right: "The moving finger writes, and having writ moves on."

We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world, a world that borders on our doors. If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark, and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.

Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. This is the calling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our deepest regrets? Or will there be another message -- of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it otherwise, we must choose in this crucial moment of human history.

As that noble bard of yesterday, James Russell Lowell, eloquently stated:

Once to every man and nation comes a moment to decide,
In the strife of truth and Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, God’s new Messiah offering each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever ‘twixt that darkness and that light.
Though the cause of evil prosper, yet ‘tis truth alone is strong
Though her portions be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.

And if we will only make the right choice, we will be able to transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of peace. If we will make the right choice, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. If we will but make the right choice, we will be able to speed up the day, all over America and all over the world, when "justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."

- Martin Luther King, Jr. from A Time to Break Silence While all decisions are a guess about the future, as complexity builds upon complexity decision-makers must increasingly rely on their intuition and judgment.  This chapter explores the decision-making process for complex situations in a complex environment (complex adaptive messes) in terms of:  laying the groundwork for decision-making, understanding and exploring complex situations, discussing human additive factors, preparing for the decision process and mechanisms for influencing complex situations. Looks like connect-worthy seems like a natural response to economic crisis - people turning to one another Based on some feedback, I updated the "Commanding Heights". The lesson to take is that the world can take one of the two directions: a new type of feudalism (described by Michel Bauwens) or a world described by Multitude Project, in which individuals are in control of what they want to become and of what they are. Diaspora (the new type of social network) is to Facebook what SENSORICA is to Google. 
Constructive criticism is appreciated!

David Hodgson, Katie Johnson, andI, Bobby Fishkin, have found a time for our next hike. Friday April 13th at 5:15pm at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco (100 34th Avenue  San Francisco, CA 94121). We will have a good hike from there. After the Legion of Honor, a bunch of us will carry on forward to Fort Mason where dozens of food trucks and live music will be available to us. After that, Katie Johnson has generously invited those of you who would wish to carry on further on over to her house and roof at Marina and Fillmore. 
Warm regards,

The case presented on openness/authoritarian divide between liberals/conservatives in scientific studies excellent. BUT, missing is that all that people judge about the world comes from biased reports and propaganda - NOT a perceived, direct reality. Digital technology has amplified this situation. There is a dangerous resonance building between individual differences in cognition and the systems we learn about reality beyond our immediacy. http://www.exitstrata.com/announcing-the-awesome-creator-series/

This is why we get up in the morning. This “maverick spirit” is back, in the air. In social revolution, in political unrest, in creative ventures, and in the upending of the institutions that have muted and disinvested the communities that breed collective inspiration and generosity.
“Digital democracy” is right! We understand that tech can feel “cold” but wish to rid ourselves of this stultifying, too-small notion. The internet is a human thing, a rewiring of our connections across illusory boundaries. The work we do here reduces redundancies and allows us to share and learn and create value in, well, u-topia [no-place] — something we can then take to the ground and use in real life.

Here on the virtual extension of our “IRL” community, we wish to draw value to you by lavishing attention, praise, and legitimation of your process. We think that being a creative person is the most “real” job that you can have. We know that to be truly passionate in whatever medium means to lose sleep and work without pay 24 hrs a day at a job that has no “hours” – it has ALL hours. And we truly believe that by harnessing the mutual energies of our exponential network, here in the utopic web, that we can usher in a new period of satisfaction, and even “success.” Privatised prisons are run for profit where does the raw material come from?

A recent article in Wired Magazine about Richard Ross’s extraordinary project Juvenile In Justice is worthy of mention and illumination. If you want to know why our industrial society is no longer relevant for what we as people want and what our society needs, then you need to read this book. Below a post I made last year on the project.

http://www.no-straight-lines.com/blog/privatised-prisons-are-run-for-profit-where-does-the-raw-material-come-from/ Dear all, I am looking for producers/"architects"/strategists in the transmedia space - and wonder if you can help. Here is why: http://globalgea.net/uncategorized/media-wanted/

Brief: MISA, GlobalGEA and a few other allied global initiatives are developing a media strategy for the Societal Metamorphosis movement we are collectively growing. We've created a proposal summarizing our thinking so far - please follow the link above. In essence, we are seeking to grow a generative alliance with a potent/energized/visionary transmedia team capable of telling the BIG STORY of humanity's next great age and the evolving Societal Metamorphosis movement. The story would include a growing alliance of global and regional initiatives, as well as individuals, that are part of this movement, and may eventually become a kind of "generative reality show" and the primary vehicle for this world transformation, spreading into regions around the planet (i.e. going "local")

If you know of any transmedia players that would be up to this challenge, please let me know!

Between 1968 and 1972, Stewart Brand published The Whole Earth Catalog. For Kevin Kelly, the Catalog was essentially “a paper-based database offering thousands of hacks, tips, tools, suggestions, and possibilities for optimizing your life.” For Steve Jobs, it was a “Bible” of his generation, a kind of Google 35 years before Google came along. (On a side note, I highly recommend the commencement speech where Jobs made those comments.) The very good news is that The Whole Earth Catalog and some related publications are now available online.

Hi everyone - hope you're well.
An issue I've been dealing with lately is the framing of paradigm shifts through the narrow lens of climate change and the need to do something about humanity's greatest struggle. I think this lens harms necessary social change because it easily attaches to the politically polarizing debate on "what to do about climate change" and distracts from poignant and important issues.

This loosening of rigid gender roles can be credited to feminism, Schalet contends, and even if it has “largely flown under the radar of American popular culture,” it is nonetheless given boys the “cultural leeway to choose a first time that feels emotionally right.”

http://www.drupa.com/ BHUTAN & " National Happiness Commission" 
I (Robert Costanza) recently returned from a trip to Bhutan, a small Himalayan county where their enlightened former king declared that the goal of his country's policy was "Gross National Happiness" (GNH) rather than "Gross Domestic Product" (GDP).

I say "former king" for two reasons. The first is because he passed the crown on to his son. The second is because neither he nor his heir now govern as absolute monarchs. In what must be the first time in recorded history, the king had to convince his subjects (in the face of real opposition) that democracy was a better way. After a very interesting and unique transition, Bhutan is now a constitutional monarchy - much like the United Kingdom - where the king has mainly ceremonial duties.

The new Prime Minister, Lyonchoen Jigme Y Thinley, and the elected government have set up a "Gross National Happiness Commission" (GNHC) to implement the process of both measuring GNH and ensuring that the country's policies are aimed at improving it. They have undertaken surveys of GNH and developed a GNH policy screen. National policies include the goal to become the first country to produce only organic food, and to be a net carbon dioxide sink in perpetuity.

Why are the Bhutanese not getting on the bandwagon that GDP growth is the solution to all problems? They recognise that while traditional economic growth has in the past been a major means to improving social well-being, it is now causing at least as many problems as it solves. It is not sustainable because it is pushing us beyond the planet's environmentally safe operating space. It is also not always desirable because it only contributes to improved well-being up to a point. We need a new approach to economic progress that takes into account the hidden costs of traditional growth, on jobs, on families, on society, on nature, and ultimately on our happiness and quality of life and its sustainability.

GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period. But GDP was never intended as a measure of well-being or progress. It only measures national income or activity and it includes only those goods and services traded for money. It also adds everything together, without differentiating between desirable, well-being-enhancing economic activity and undesirable, well-being-reducing activity.

An oil spill, for example, increases GDP because someone has to clean it up, but it obviously detracts from well-being. More crime, more sickness, more war, more pollution, more fires, storms and pestilence are all potentially positives for GDP because they can cause an increase in economic activity. GDP also takes no account of how the national income is distributed among people, ignoring the fact that a dollar's worth of income produces more well-being for a poor person than a rich one.

Alternative measures of progress, like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), adjust for these problems with GDP to arrive at a better approximation of "national well-being". Results show that while the US GDP has steadily increased since 1950 (with the occasional recession), GPI peaked around 1975 and has been relatively flat or declining ever since.

So what do the Bhutanese mean by GNH? Bhutan recently completed a survey of 8,000 of its citizens, asking them over 200 questions about various aspects of their lives and how satisfied they are with them. It is what social scientists call an assessment of "subjective well-being", or SWB - an area of research that is getting increasing attention in many quarters of science and policy as part of the emerging "science of happiness". In the US, for example, SWB surveys show flat or dropping scores over the last several decades, consistent with the flattening GPI estimates. 
But the GNHC and others in Bhutan recognise that there are other, more objective elements that are also important in assessing their country's overall well-being. Our team was brought in to help incorporate "natural capital" and the ecosystem services it provides into their national accounting framework.

Ecosystem services are the often un-accounted for benefits that people derive from nature - clean air, water, and soil, a stable climate, recreational and spiritual opportunities to connect with nature, and many more. We estimated in a previous study that, on a global basis, these services were worth in aggregate more than all of global GNP combined.
But these services do not yet adequately appear in any country's national accounts. Bhutan sees itself as a leader in rectifying this situation. We held a workshop there last March with over 40 representatives from several government agencies, universities and others to assess how best to do this.

We plan to hold a series of follow-up workshops involving students and faculty from the US working with the Bhutanese to help them become a model of sustainable well-being and to help us do the same.

We all have a lot to learn from Bhutan. They are a small county not yet addicted to economic growth in the conventional sense. They can step back and ask the really important questions: What is happiness? How do we best pursue it? How does one person's happiness depend on everyone else's? How important is nature to our happiness and its sustainability? How much and what types of material consumption do we really need to be happy?

The founders of the United States also asked themselves many of these same questions. They set up a country devoted to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness". Bhutan is helping us to better understand the interdependence of all life on earth, the responsibilities that come with individual liberty, and the meaning and measure of happiness. These are issues we will all have to collaboratively grapple with and better understand if we hope to create a world where humanity can flourish and be happy within the finite boundaries of the amazing planet we inhabit.

Does anyone know of any free software that would allow me to do Picture-in-Picture videos? Say I want to record my screen but I also want my webcam to record and show in the lower right-hand corner of my screen. Has anyone found a way to do this simply that doesn't require a lot of editing and synchronization etc.?

I'm taking this free online courses from Stanford and Michigan State and all the video lectures are in that format: You have Slides, similar to PowerPoint, and then you have a video at the lower right, of the Professor. I find this to be extremely well-suited to online learning and would want to make my own videos.. But I can't find a quick way to do it that doesn't require a lot of editing.

I can do the editing if I have to, but it would be much quicker if a piece of software would do it for me. I also thought this could be a thread that would interest people in The Next Edge, cause essentially it has to do with online learning.

Venessa Miemis Did you guys have that sort of thing in the Junto stuff you did with video conversations? I haven't tried Google Hangouts yet with my webcam, I guess I could do a hangout and just record the screen, have a Presentation in Gdoc or something.. Anyway if anyone has a solution, I would be very grateful. I could potentially afford to purchase the necessary software, but I'd rather not. Call me an old pennypinching Scrooge. ;-) I've been waiting for a signal like this to appear for some time. This internal(ish) email at Mozilla represents a critical waypoint toward effectively stewarding the shift.

In short: Mozilla is aligning their internal resources to turn the open web itself into the polished computing platform we need it to be.. essentially rendering current paradigm operating systems secondary because they are not the web.

We must align our storytelling resources to help work out the kinks of this next web and hasten momentum of its global adoption. This itself will be a major accelerant in 'getting shift done'.

More to come on Mozilla's internal 'Kilimanjaro Event' and how we can align to their drum beat. Hugely important interview by Bill Moyers. He finally interviews someone who's talking about Whole System Political Change! INCOME GAP

When I experienced life-threatening illness in the 90's, Anna mentored me to make dances as a way to live. Teaching and choreographing collaborative dance for personal and social change over the last twelve years, I discovered that in ensemble movement exploration, the self begins to identify with the intimacy of connection to life, and the act of making of stories rather than stories themselves. Stories that we tell ourselves emerge and fall away, just like breathing. The Self one knows becomes Selfing.

If getting a degree in public policy, the environment is sure to come up in some way. Everything from climate change to global warming to current laws is under constant scrutiny, and as a result, is constantly changing. With no one source to turn to, turning to the millions of users on YouTube can be just as challenging when trying to learn more about the environment.

To help out, we have gathered 50 must see YouTube videos to learn about the U.S. environmental policy. They can help you get a foundation for learning the basics, teach more about national and international law, and even give the skeptic’s point of view. So grab a recording and bookmarking device, and maybe a few note cards, and be prepared to know lots more about the environment.

I say "final chapter" because - if they win in November (which could happen) - their reality will become "the official reality"... and the rest of us here in America will have to compete with their lies even, essentially, to tell what time of day it is.

We cannot borrow much more before this capital is exhausted. Comments welcome! http://avbp.net/?p=1252 I have been refining an earlier post I wrote here and just published the expanded version today. I wrote it because I am still hoping that we might find, in fun, a common ground, and together explore how we might take better notice, and perhaps even make more focused use of the emerging embodiments of play and games. To what ends? That is what I hope we will at least be able to consider together here.

http://the99percent.com/articles/7158/What-It-Takes-To-Innovate-Wrong-Thinking-Tinkering-Intuiting http://www.mbaonline.com/cost-of-iphone/ You ever have one of those friends that you meet and you instantly hit it off. And you proceed to act as if you've been friends since childhood?

Chudi Igboemeka is one of those friends for me.

We met at the height of the Internet boom in a bar in Palo Alto, CA a couple blocks from my place. We used to smoke weed, and hang out with smart and beautiful women, and go to work the next day and our work was better for it. Chudi and I didn't hang out with women because we were chasing them, we just liked them better. We appreciated women for the wonderful creatures they were. I never would have found my wonderful wife Jen if not for the high standards one gets after hanging out with strong, powerful, playful and delightfully unpredictable women as friends. Chudi helped me learn how to do this effortlessly. To drop the male apprehension.

Chudi had a smile so big, and love energy so kind, that women—who notice these things—would come up to him and introduce themselves. I'm sure its even better know that's its wise too. One of my favorite memories of my whole life was a wild weekend in Vegas sponsored by one of the bright flaming stars of the first Internet boom, I brought Chudi along.

What I remember most about that weekend was the laughter.

Many of my favorite memories of my life involve Chudi, sitting listening to chill music, discussing the world and what it was like, and what it might be.

I haven't been in the same place as Chudi in years. But I always said to myself, when I finally figure out exactly what I'm going to do, my place, and I need a partner in adventure, Chudi will have a place by my side, if he wants, when he wants, doing whatever he wants.

Son of a Nigerian father and a mother from St. Kitts, and raised in the Kitchener/Waterloo/Toronto area:

Welcome the finest gentleman I have ever known.

Chudi, this place is special to me. We are here working on ways to change the world together. Check out the discussions for a bit and then lets talk about what you'd most like to do in the whole world. This group can help you do it.

(NYC, April 18th) There’ll be a lot of people sitting at a raised podium, addressing concentric rings of elevated chairs in the grand European style (schedule, provisional). There will be dramatically senior bureaucrats talking and gesturing about their departments. There will be simultaneous translation. In short, there’ll be a chance to see the Machinery of Europe going along as normal, with 150 or so other madly productive maniacs from the Internet. That would be us.

Now, this is where we are going out on a limb, in several ways, to make a conference which is unlike anything ever done before on earth. Note… this is government funded real innovation.

And how does it invent a new vocabulary for praxis? How does this general intellect, and idea that has been strengthened over the last few decades, transform into political action? On what grounds can this emergent politics be conjoined across disparate sites and struggles?  How do those struggles and approaches get translated elsewhere? This is a really nice initiative.

http://manzimvula.com/our-ideas/item/49-focus-on-growth-international-expansion-are-you-ready?.html I would thoroughly recommend to yall to join in for one of Howard Rheingold's talks coming up on April 5th and April 24th-- Like it or not, knowing how to make use of online tools without being overloaded with too much information is an essential ingredient to personal success in the 21st century. How can we use digital media so that they make us empowered participants rather than passive receivers? In Net Smart, author and Stanford lecturer Rheingold shows how to use social media intelligently, humanely, and, above all, mindfully. 

There is a bigger social issue at work in digital literacy, one that goes beyond personal empowerment. If we combine our individual efforts wisely, it could produce a more thoughtful society: countless small acts like publishing a Web page or sharing a link could add up to a public good that enriches everyone.

Howard Rheingold is going to speak at Stanford this Thursday, April 5, at 6 PM in Braun Lecture Hall in the Mudd Chem Bldg.

April 25 will mark my first ever flight overseas (I live in Canada) to spend ten days in Copenhagen studying museum exhibits there for my post-secondary program. On May 5th, my time in Europe then becomes open-ended, and what I would love is for the opportunity to connect with others possibly from the Next Edge or recommended by the Next Edge, whether it's meeting for coffee, a place for me stay a night, a week, a month, or any opportunity to co-create the next edge. I'm a 20 year old lad well versed in edgespeak and many skills ranging from a helping hand in the garden to the designing and building of websites and web platforms, and would love nothing more than a chance to work and think and play with like minded people on my trip. With my mind, time, energy, and heart open, I believe that anything is possible.

http://acitytomakeme.blogspot.com/ A new study by the American Journal of Public Health takes a look at how certain social factors contribute to early deaths. Looking at just the year 2000 - the study found that 245,000 Americans died from causes directly related to low education. In comparison, according to FBI crime data - just over 15,000 Americans were murdered in the year 2000. That means nearly 15 times as many Americans died because they failed to achieve adequate levels of education than were killed in acts of homicide. And out of the 34 OECD nations - American high school students currently rank 14th for reading skills - 17th for science - and 25th for math skills. It is the year 2025. What is life like for you? What do you do? And what does the world you live in look like?   Would love to hear about the images you see. This kind of technology fills my heart with joy! "The reason that big data proponents are so excited about the burgeoning data revolution isn't just because of the math. Don't get me wrong, the math is fun, but we're excited because we can begin to distill patterns that were previously invisible to us due to a lack of information." A few weeks back, David Hodgson posted an article on Next Edge about the true cost of gasoline at the pump... which inspired me to write this.

Not so much seeking individuals, but ok if you've got great recommendations. Mostly seeking great discussion. All great experiences welcome. Thanks, gang! Bootstrapping with food, energy, physical production: 

I see a lot of great ideas come from The Next Edge and affiliated groups. One of the obstacles for many of the ideas is that they live rather far away from the "point of consumption", the place in people's lives where they will gain tangible benefit from the outcomes of applying ideas. So, the projects tend to seek either the free time of software developers with a possibility of future reward, or donation-based funding (kickstarter, etc), or some kind of philanthropic grants/donations from larger institutions. Many times this donating of time or funds fails to gain momentum or materialize. Projects stall, people become frustrated, etc. The cycle repeats around a new idea. (this is leaving aside interpersonal dynamics, and quests for power, that also play a big role in sabotaging goodwill that could make these projects actually work once in a while, but I digress...)

I've personally come to the conclusion personally that investing in commons requires building commons (open source software, hardware, education resources, access to space, land, time, energy, etc) around rather boring but productive commercial activity around producing food, energy, and physical goods. The economics are quite simple: there is a massive demand for certain variants all three that far outstrips supply (fresh local organic food, renewable energy, modular and adaptable physical goods and technologies). It also turns out that using commons as a foundation for these market activities actually can give you competitive advantage against those who are averse to commons, and cooperative connection to those who participate (even when they otherwise seem like competitors). Fulfilling these needs also focuses the more general ideas around things like alternative economies, social media technologies, etc into practical supportive directions, with economies that can sustain funding for a long time. It's my opinion that if done right, the revenue from food, energy and physical production can fund the kinds of work people are trying to do here. This is what I am engaged in now, and it's already paying off. 

My purpose in writing this is to simply share it, for whatever it is worth. I don't expect you to agree with me, or to do anything about it. Genesis of contradiction as a mode of autobiography?

"But the story of the War for the Internet, as it’s usually told, leaves out the characters who have the best chance to resolve the conflict in a reasonable way. Think of these people as the forces of Organized Chaos. They are more farsighted than the forces of Order and Disorder. "

http://www.miiu.org/wiki/Lexicon congrats to Jean Russell for launching The Agency, & thanks for doing the interview! Tomorrow's Earth Hour is seriously confused as to when its happening.

You have to love it when a globally synchronised event can't figure out when its happening.

Friends said it is for 8:30pm, but it was unclear if this is a specific timezone or some specific time - so I figured I'd ask the site.

Notice on the attached screenshot - its 1:07pm my time (in San Francisco).

The website says 8:30pm - but it still doesn't say a timezone or that its local time.

Their main site reckons its 1d4h22m away, which would be 5:30pm here, or 8:30pm east coast US time - so maybe they really mean 8:30pm US East Coast time,

If you follow the link to select from a map - and choose USA - you get the lower window 1d8h22m or 9:30pm here which would be 8:30pm somewhere out in the ocean?.

Their mobile window thinks its happening in 10h37m from now - which would be 11:45pm tonight - I can't figure anywhere in the world that would even be close to 10:30pm !

Whatever you think of the power of globally synchronised symbolic events (rather than concrete lasting actions) - they aren't going to work if people don't know when they happen.

Hopefully they'll get it fixed in the 10-31 hours between now and then :-) I choose Paradise....
http://www.paradiseoroblivion.com/watch.html I like Chris Blattman for perusing development economics and for being a great blogger. His post, "Why you should care more about who leads the World Bank" prompted a clash in what are admittedly stereotypes, or rules of thumb I use to form opinions about political issues. 

Blattman is siding with Lant Pritchett in favor of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to head the World Bank.  I pause partly because of Pritchett's professional history and partly because of the handling of ending the fule subsidy in Nigeria for which Okonjo-Iweala is accountable. On the other hand I do think it time for a non-US head of the World Bank. But Jim Kim's history suggests policies I'm more aligned with.

I take Blattman's call to care to heart, but feel at a loss to assess what's going on and what really matters. I wonder if others here have some perspective about what it means to care about who leads the World Bank?  http://chrisblattman.com/2012/03/29/why-you-should-care-more-about-who-leads-the-world-bank/ I'm speaking at the 2012 Gamification Summit in SF, June 19-21st.

http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/03/29/in-search-of-agency/ Some interesting points to ponder on.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/mike-krieger-when-central-banking-dies-china-and-oil "In Chuang Tzu, a traveler sees a farmer laboriously carrying water with a pitcher to water his crops. The traveler walks up to the man and suggests that the irrigation could be done for a hundred plots much more simply with a draw-well and channels (a piece of appropriate technology if ever there was one). This is the farmer’s response:

I have heard my teacher say: ‘When a man uses a machine he carries on all his business in a machine-like manner. Whoever does his business in the manner of a machine develops a machine heart. Whoever has a machine heart in his breast loses his simplicity. Whoever loses his simplicity becomes uncertain in the impulses of his spirit. Uncertainty in the impulses of the spirit is something that is incompatible with truth.’ Not that I am unfamiliar with such devises; I am ashamed to use them." Social Entrepreneurs continue to be seen as sustainability leaders.
Latest survey results from Globescan

http://www.globescan.com/news_archives/tss2012_leadership/The_2012_Sustainability_Leaders.pdf So, what about fun and games?

Spectator sports are also called "national pastimes." As such they reflect the cultures that nurture them. Baseball, football, rugby, tennis, golf, competitive sailing and the like model societal norms that include great wealth, exclusivity, dominance by the few. Despite the ubiquity, even in the poorest neighborhoods, of basketball courts, football and baseball fields, and the promise that these facilities imply that even the poorest can become superstars, the truth is that for most, the sport remains one for spectators rather than for players.

The parallels between sports, government, military and banking are too many to disassociate one from the other. Both, despite claims of inclusivity, are played and officiated by an elite minority. Spectators and citizens have, for the most part, only indirect influence on outcomes. 

In the early 70s, I had the privilege to be part of a "movement" called "New Games." (you can find more background here - http://www.pgpedia.com/n/new-games-foundation - ). It was started by a few people who were, at the time, the seeds of a new culture (notably, Stewart Brand, author of The Whole Earth Catalog) - one that manifested itself through public celebrations of community playfulness. The New Games Tournaments were playful, creative and inclusive, where the only rules were "play fair, play hard, nobody hurt." There were no spectators, only players. There were many games, played simultaneously, that anybody could join or quit. There was music and art and invitations to play at any level for any age with any ability.

The New Games movement eventually spread throughout the world. It changed, adapted, and its influence can still be found in youth groups throughout the world. But it acts more as a reminder than as an influencer. 

But it remains a testimony to the power of play and playfulness as tools for the creation and celebration of community. Love consists in sharing what one has and what one is with those one loves. Love ought to show itself in deeds more than in words! St Ignatius I am reminded of my catastrophe thinking post of 2010. http://thrivable.net/2010/07/11/catastrophe-thinking/ It was my one of most popular post ever (thanks John Hagel and Tim O'Reilly). I followed it with "Why the Optimism" http://thrivable.net/2010/07/23/why-the-optimism/ I don't see any of the freaked out environmentalists saying - "hey, we started doing this in the 70s and we have succeeded on these points. Now we are after...." And I also don't see many of the peace advocates standing on the success we have made in reducing human violent conflict. http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflict.htm And collaboration-driven folks keep talking like we don't know how to collaborate yet. We do and we are getting better at it all the time. Just look at the proliferation of open space technology, personal development work, consciousness work, redefinitions of leadership, etc...

Let us stand on TOP of the work we have done together. We are doing it. We have been doing it. We will continue to do it. And it will get even better.

http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679511/the-secret-scandinavian-ingredient-that-makes-their-tech-good-for-the-world Ever feel like the answer is right under your nose, but you can't see under your nose very well? Like without a mirror you can't see that nose hairs are showing? 

I feel like we are stuck in some story, possibly generated by marxist and anti-capitalists (at least something about it seems familiar from my dance through those realms in my 20s). Some story about capitalism being broken... crisis (or mega-crisis) looming... and unless we... 

It irks me just about as much as the whole "be the change" meme drives me bonkers. Honey, if you want to be the change, stop aspiring to it and BE it already. If you want the "unless we..." stop talking about it and do it.
 
What is being waited for? 
What if the conditions are perfect **right now**? 
What if everything that has happened was the only thing that could have?
What if everything we go through was part of long term social feedback loops that trigger cultural and societal shifts?
What if we are enough and all that we need?

We are already shifting. We are already changing. It isn't happening tomorrow. It started happening yesterday... like a long ago yesterday... like in the 60s and 70s. We are in phase 2 now. I think the next edge is about beginning to operate in phase 3.  

We aren't waiting for a tomorrow to come, we are blind that yesterday already happened. You are already being the change. You are already in action. 

Build, baby, build!

"The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability" by James Gustave Speth

"How serious are the threats to our environment? Here is one measure of the problem: if we continue to do exactly what we are doing, with no growth in the human population or the world economy, the world in the latter part of this century will be unfit to live in. Of course human activities are not holding at current levels—they are accelerating, dramatically—and so, too, is the pace of climate disruption, biotic impoverishment, and toxification. In this book Gus Speth, author of Red Sky at Morning and a widely respected environmentalist, begins with the observation that the environmental community has grown in strength and sophistication, but the environment has continued to decline, to the point that we are now at the edge of catastrophe.
 
Speth contends that this situation is a severe indictment of the economic and political system we call modern capitalism. Our vital task is now to change the operating instructions for today’s destructive world economy before it is too late. The book is about how to do that."

"It is a popular restlessness, not  just elitist hand-wringing. The latter is a permanent feature of world history; it is hard to find a period when the intellectual elites have not been animated by a sense of both crisis and opportunity.  This is not true of popular restlessness (which is different from popular unrest).

The popular restlessness has also been amplified by the collapse of traditional publishing. Not only is nobody in charge anymore, there are no official-sounding voices even pretending to be in charge. ”Newspaper of record” sounds almost archaic today.

The restlessness represents a social energy that seeks to do big things and looks for both intellectual and political leadership. It is a social energy that swings wildly between a sense of limitless potential and deep despair, and is hungry for both meaningful perspectives and rallying cries." I've been letting money get in the way of me and my dreams for a just world where everyone is treated with respect, dignity and love.

No more. 

Money is not the issue. Our own belief in our self is the issue.

I know this from my own experience.

I've been letting it hold me back too.

No more. I am out of money. None at all. Well, $27 in my pocket. No more anywhere. My wife doesn't work.

And that is all it will take to change the world.

I can't tell you want you should do. You can only tell yourself that. I can only tell you what I am going to do, and why, and what I think that will start.

You will have to decide for yourself if you want to help or if you too are a crazy motherfucker like me and want to give this a shot.

Tomorrow, I'm going to make my way to Orlando, FL. The home of Disney World. And I'm going to walk the 35-odd miles from Disney to Sanford, Florida the former home of Trayvon Martin. And I'm going to talk to Trayvon's family if I can and learn their story. And I'm going to talk to the killer, if I can, and learn his story, the real story from his perspective. And I'm going to talk a bit with people about the real way that black and brown and red people are still being treated in the U.S.

Then I'm going to gather up my stuff, and any friends with me. And we are going to set off for New Orleans. On foot. And we are going to walk the 1306 miles from Sanford to New Orleans, Lousiana, and Montgomery Alabama to Savannah, Georgia in time for the Tall Ships Festival on May 3rd.

After the festival we are going to walk the 250-odd miles to Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta Georgia where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his sermons and help start the U.S. Civil Rights movement.

Then we are going to walk up the Blue Ridge Parkway to Harper's Ferry, where John Brown tried to end slavery. Then to Gettysburg where Lincoln first called us to examine the test whether a nation conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal could long endure.

And we are going to march from Gettysburg to Philadelphia, the home of the Freedom Bell and where the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence were written.

And then... only then... are we going to march on D.C.

And it will be epic. 

And I really hope it resonate with you all, because I'd love to have you along. It's going to be one hell of a party.

The way to honor those who have suffered under the oppression of our current system and way of thinking, those who have died even, is to tell their story and tell how you were motivated by their story to do something when the time came. At least that's why I'm going.

So, if it seems like this is something that fits with our style, let me know. I'd love to have your help. I'm going to need some, I don't even have enough gas in my car to get to Orlando, but I'm going if I have to hitchhike.

I hope you consider it. Much love to a wonderful group.

"Consider a possible/probable “Global MegaCrisis”—an emerging “perfect storm” of climate change, economic crises, joblessness, growing inequality, corruption, terrorism, and more. Few experts attempt such a synthesizing overview, there is little agreement on terminology or indicators, and, where there is some consensus, there is little agreement on whether—or if—the MegaCrisis will be resolved or alleviated, how, and when. If we are headed toward MegaCrisis, is there something basically wrong with our thinking—the need for a new master paradigm about the role of futures-relevant knowledge in our information-drenched society?" i was in conversation with Maura Dilley yesterday, and the concept of biomimetic organizations came up - what would an organization look like whose operational structure was modelled on nature... i googled and found the attached paper .. "

The concept of the amoeba organization (or single cell organization) was firstly introduced in the company W.L. Gore & Associates in 1958. At that time the whole organization of this company was futuristic and science fiction in the eyes of commoners. Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore who founded it together with his wife Vieve had been additionally proclaimed anti-manager. The organization resided on principles like complete decentralization, self-organizing teams, flat hierarchy and organizational chaos. The concept of the amoeba is a biocybernetic metaphor since its original ancient Greek meaning implies change or changeability. Especially a known subform of the  Amoeba Proteus the so called Amoeba Chaos Chaos underlines the connection between chaos theory and this kind of organization. The amoeba organization relies on two simple but strong principles: (1) the organization is a process,  not a structure, and (2) the organization is a complex (chaotic) system." They speak for themselves...

Sorry, this invite just arrived and seemed like it might interest some NE folks:
RSVP here and join us tomorrow (Wed) evening for a fun event with folks building community and forging new ways of relating to one another and the planet, abroad and domestically. Bring a friend or housemate/homesteadmate and save $5! Please help spread the word about this great learning opportunity that came together at the last minute.

Secrets of Sustainability: Money, Sex, Nature & Peace at Tamera,Twin Oaks
Wed 3/28, 6 pm potluck, 7 pm talks at PLACE for Sustainable Living
Co-sponsored by East Bay Cohousing. Hear first-hand from 
Kate Bunney, of Tamera community in Portugal, and Paxus of Twin Oaks in Virginia. Discover how alternative approaches to green living and sharing can change how we relate to one another, in so many ways. Together, we can learn from these unique models and deepen our connection to peaceful, sustainable community in our cohousing neighborhoods and group houses.

Potluck dinner at 6, followed by talks/slide shows (roughly 7 pm start) with long-time members of two of the world's foremost innovative intentional communities.
Tamera Healing Biotope-1 is a 
deep ecology and 
spiritually oriented community, an offshoot of the German ZEGG movement founders, now reviving a desert area of Portugal through 

permaculture design. The 200 residents work together to model a non-violent existence of people and between people and nature. Its main missions are education, creating a self-sufficient 

Solar Village, and global networking under the name of GRACE.

Kate will present a 'talk-shop' on 
Creating Peace Models for a New Culture. She will cover an overview of Tamera as a research and demonstration site.. emphasizing the 
global campus educational aspect of the project.
Twin Oaks Community, founded in Louisa County, 

Virginia (

where the recent DC-area earthquake happened) in the 1960s, is the most successful and largest 

income-sharing (

secular) community. Eightyresidents and numerous visitors live and work through a unique member planning system. Each works 45 hours a week at housecleaning, tofu-making, hammock knotting, cattle herding, attending meetings, gardening, cooking, and childcare among other community-valued contributions. It has been called a 

feminist community because the work system includes child-rearing and domestic tasks with equal credit to other forms of work.

Longtime member 

Paxus Calta has hitchhiked on sailboats across the Pacific, 

danced atop Russian tanks before Yeltsin made it fashionable, 

smuggled Tibetan monks across the Himalayas, worked on the North Slope of Alaska for a nasty oil company. He also worked on an ocean engineering project in Hawaii that laid power cable on the ocean floor and dispatched submarines. For 7 years he 

fought nuclear power plants in eastern Europe. He taught a class on 

how to design revolutions at an alternative high school. He has been arrested for 

crimes of conscience in 12 countries on three continents and is one of two dads of Willow Falcon Star born on Valentines Day 2002. He suffers from 

terminal immodesty and an 

inflamed funny bone. He has lived at Twin Oaks Community for 12 years.

Paxus will speak about 

Sharing Systems: At the center of intentional community life is the behavior of sharing, both socio-cultural things and material things (

not to mention shared lives). He will discuss Twin Oaks' different systems around 

sharing vehicles, clothes, bicycles and a single collectivebank account. He explores the ideas of flexible agreements, semi-permeable dual systems (

public/personal), control points and more. He'll also share what's true and what's silly about the recent film 

Wanderlust, which gently mocks a TO-style 

poly-friendly commune. Here's a taste:

SUGGESTED DONATION: $20 (
$15 for EBCOHO Supporting Members and PLACE members, or bring a friend and save $5 each) to benefit the speakers' organizations, PLACE, and EBCOHO, plus food or drink to share (
if coming for the potluck). Pay-what-you-can, work-trade and alternative currency options available -- ask us!
RSVP through EBCOHO and we'll save you a seat (until 7)See you there! 

P.S. This event represents another great EBCOHO collaboration with the good folks of The PLACE for Sustainable Living, which is re-opening for exciting Spring season activities at its wonderful Oakland/Berkeley/Emeryville ("Oakleyville") community clubhouse.

PLACE stands for 

People Linking Art, Community and Ecology, the home base for the 

Sustainable Living Roadshow; it hosted several EBCOHO gatherings last year, and now has insulation installed so we can meet there in greater comfort. Am I an asshole for refusing to sign casual NDAs? i've been pondering the metaphor of ecosystems recently, in contrast to that of the network. The ecosystem metaphor embodies diversity, creativity, emergence, innovation, evolution, resilience, thrivability, adaptiveness, and multi-dimensional value flows in a way that the network metaphor does not. An ecosystem does lots of radically different things simultaneously. The dominant worldview right now is that of the machine. We see most things as machines, as organizations. Predict and control. The rapidly emerging worldview is that of the ecosystem. The Next Edge is an ecosystem. Emergence happens within an ecosystem when elements are constellated. The right things come together within an ecosystem and something new emerges. What are the necessary pre-conditions to catalyze a human ecosystem into self constellation? What is needed for an autocatalytic, autopoetic system to emerge? Hello edgers.  Here is my piece of the SIBOS Innotribe talk on New Economies.  Would love some constructive feedback.  (The whole hour featuring many-an-edger is on Innotribe youtube site) 

http://www.ingenesist.com/general-info/the-new-economy-movement.html I find that during a creative period I need time alone to reflect, followed by time to reflect with others. Its "reflect with others" time. I have 3 major interests converging into a serious game. 1) World Changing Games 2) alternative economics 3) alternative health care...specifically using botanicals.  I also think change-makers can accomplish more when they're relatively healthy and "feeling good". I think we need to reclaim sovereignty over our own health, over our own bodies/minds/spirits.

So, here's an introduction to the Herbal Coaching Community's Game of Life. Its in development and should launch in another month or so. I'm especially interested in ideas for game play...involving converting game points into an alt. currency that can be transferred within and outside of the game.  Its primary platform is on Curatr, which is exploring the use of Mozilla's Open Badges. Any and all ideas and suggestions are welcome.  www.herbcoachingcommunity.com Anyone attending HOPE? http://www.hopenumbernine.net/speakers/   I want to give a talk about "value networks" and SENSORICA. If you go, and if you are interested by the topic please contact me. See www.sensorica.co MIGHT COLLAPSE BE THE WRONG METAPHOR?

It may be prudent to use a montage of metaphors for major domains. While COLLAPSE remains a viable metaphor for longer term future scenarios as well as apt descriptor for what is happening in some regions, it may be masking more apt metaphors for what emergents face in the present and near future.  This was my situation until recently shifted while reading Arundhati Roy's latest superb essay: "Capitalism: A Ghost Story".  IMHO this long essay is an essential read.
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30877.htm

Beginning with a review of "Gush-Up" in India's shift to global capitalist tyranny (blowing away the myth of a Gandhian peaceful India), giving me a view of India potentially as dangerous as US imperialism, Roy romps through an excellent but concise history of the rise of global capitalism and an excellent expose of how corporate philanthropy gains support of the middle class and professional elites.  Although these scenarios forecast genocidal actions on large human populations and severe attacks on our biosphere, they call forth metaphors of transition, not collapse; of brutal oppression, not passive acceptance.

Although longer term scenarios may involve an eventual collapse of global corporatism (or whatever we come to call this new process ALSO EMERGING among the power hungry elites), the societal environments with which OUR EMERGENCE encounters may not be one with opportunities appearing during collapse.  We need to re-examine our metamorphic metaphor for emergence. In biological metamorphosis the caterpillar is passive in a cocoon, dissolving into a nutrient soup for the emerging imaginal buds. Our societal caterpillar is far from passive. It is moving full steam ahead becoming a more powerful caterpillar, increasing dangerous to Gaia and to the vitality of our emergent societal imaginal buds.

I sense the dominant attitude among fellow emergents is to focus almost exclusively on augmenting our own emergence and to assume the metaphor of collapse because (rightly, IMHO) there is nothing we can do to directly influence the game of the elites.  While I fully agree that our primary focus must be our own emergence I fear it is dangerous to assume a passive attitude to our societal environment.  Not that we engage it in vain hopes we can significantly transform it, but that our strategies must take into account this reality and that we explore endgame strategies and what actions we must be taking now so that we can have greater influence on the resultant endgame.

My concern is that we lack a "discourse process" and "platforms" adequate for successful, continuing "dialog-to-action" on an issue of such magnitude, complexity, and security concerns.  I use quotes because I believe that we currently lack appropriate metaphors for our need. On reflection about ongoing interaction on "big pictures" I sense endless jabber (but often of high quality at this level).  We can only begin using what we have; but we must be critically aware that something is missing and work towards creating the "technology" we need for successful, long-term metamorphosis in the face of a societal caterpillar that is not cooperative and not resigned to metamorphosis. Why focus on nothing? Why seek that emptiness? We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want! Lao Tsu ALL WOMEN ARE FULL WHOLE WOMEN.....

We will engage in a lively examination of current political and economic policies around the world, develop a keen understanding of how the forces of globalisation affect the ways companies innovate and manage innovation, and discuss what individuals can do, not only to energise their own creative and intellectual potential, but to develop jobs, improve company earnings, and contribute to economic growth around the world."

Work doesn't transform / evolve / grow until WE transform / evolve / grow. Organizations don't change; people do. Marko Slavnic whom I am privileged to call a very dear friend is also one of the most talented film makers of his generation. He has made incredible short films like markoslavnic.com/table-7/ or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3k14l8iO4. Today he launched a kickstarter campaign (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/markoslavnic/all-that-remains-feature-film) for something more ambitious: "When I started this film I knew it was a very ambitious project, but at the same time this was a story that I couldn't walk away from. The war in Bosnia has in many ways defined me, my life, and my whole existence, and as a filmmaker I feel like this is a story that I had to tell...All That Remains is a feature film written and directed by Marko Slavnic. The film is about two brothers, Tarik and Mirza, who came to the States with their family as kids in order to escape the war in Bosnia. While they were able to evade direct physical danger, the war still took a heavy toll on the family, especially the father...Now in their mid-20's the estranged brothers are brought back together when their father unexpectedly dies and leaves a letter asking them to go and scatter his ashes back home...This film isn't just about Bosnia. It's about family, about regret, about the loss of identity, and about father-son relationships. But most of all it is about the destructive power of war and the way it affects people whether they are Bosnian, Syrian, Iraqi, American, or any other nationality.

This film is a reminder that war doesn't just end with the last shot or a peace treaty. People often times tend to think that just because the news crews have gone home and the soldiers have put down their arms that life has returned to normal, when in reality it is far from that. Supporting Marko Slavnic is an act of global arts citizenship and one graceful step towards collective responsibility towards the stewardship of new art with extraordinary potential to affect the way people think. a friend just tweeted this.. mindfulness http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sfiN9tvcbM&ob=av3e

What can precipitate a monumental change in our life and lifestyle? If we realise that death is certain then is there a change in behaviour? "how much does it cost to save the cheapest Human life? That number of dollars we should call HUMANLIVES. It fluctuates like a stock price. It increases when more is given to efficient charities, since the cheapest Human lives to save are saved and the next cheapest Humans don't have such extreme problems. It decreases other times.

Translate all prices and payments and other money amounts into the unit of HUMANLIVES. Example: A commercial selling cars for only 3.2 HUMANLIVES, no HUMANLIVES down, subject to approved credit. Example: Double cheeseburger, .0003 HUMANLIVES. Would you like fries with that?" What are the principles of action and in-action? 1. What is good; do at once! 2. What is evil, delay that play! 3.

We will be meeting outside the Legion of Honor at 5pm. We would enjoy thoroughly if yall would consider joining us if you happen to be available that day. 

Afterwards, optionally, we plan to go to Off The Grid at Fort Mason where they have dozens of food trucks and live music that night. 

Let us know if you plan to join so that we can ensure we look out for you. 
Warm regards,
-Bobby

p.s. http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level Such a juicy talk about community, gifts, and more... After the "negative" post on COLLAPSE, I contrast it with this positive insight: WHO ARE WE, a query?

"WHO ARE WE?" is not a question, with an correct answer, even if we haven't yet discovered it. It is a query, a never-to-end process of discovery AND creativity; for in exploration we emerge and become more than we were.

It is often claimed that the human brain is the most complex system in the known universe. This claim has many qualifications, such as that the system must be one of contiguous matter, otherwise the solar system or Gaia (containing brains) would be more complex. Whether a star or a brain is more complex would probably hinge on our definition of complexity.  This metaphorical claim is useful for me in considering education as the most complex and most difficult enterprise for humankind: systematically augmenting changes in this most complex system, the human brain. Yet, humans approach education as a far less difficult or important enterprise than many others.  I'll return to this issue after we boost our query up a notch.

I claim that a temporally extended network of interacting human brains is a far more complex system than an individual human brain. And not just because it is composed of many brains. This speculation will take us out of many boxes. What is of interest here is not primarily the biological/molecular web of neurons, synapses and the ultra complex processes of the entire neural system in intimate interaction with the whole body. What is of interest is the patterns of interaction within this system from the moment it turns on in embryo to the patterns as the system dies.

I propose the dominant function of this brain-in-body is WORLDWEAVING. Worldweaving  autopoetically processes ongoing sensoria stimulation weaving an emergent pattern (called a "world") throughout the life of the organism. This world is "constructed", but not by conscious or intentional direction (although both are component processes within emergence). Survival (continued emergence) employs processes contemporary psychology call conditioning-to-environmental-stimuli and other higher level processes. The maintenance of the whole pattern of the accumulated woven world (including the metaphor, memory) is an essential task of worldweaving.  Conventional models have the brain (with the help of memory) modulating input to generate output (behavior & experientials) - the S/R metaphor.  We reverse this model here: sensoria stimulation modulates whole world processes leading to the "emission" of behavior and experientials.  Actually both models are useful at different times. For "advanced" humans, where earlier survival skills are less important and with technology, the creative, internal initiated activity of this emergent world/self becomes dominant.

All the above was about one human.  In autopoietic theory organisms don't communicate, they don't exchange information. Instead, they structurally couple.  We need not be concerned about the difference here because Maturana and Varela proved (using  The Laws of Form by George Spencer-Brown) that communication and structural coupling were logically equivalent.  However, as we move forward, structural coupling may be a more useful model/metaphor than communication.

Today our cultures are dominated by the myth of individuality.  We, each of us, experience our world containing our self as the primary decider of "who we are". This is an illusion.  We are "who we are" by a confluence of many factors -- ALL our sensoria fields over our lifetime interacting with the unique configuration of our specific, inherited body/neural system.  Our woven worlds are heavily culturally laden. Even as young adults we cannot change that we are a node in a temporal web that stretches back to our birth. The "self" is itself a construction of our worldweaving process,  a propensity built into our inheritance via evolution and now having troublesome implications.

Our experientials (as our behaviors) have been conditioned to view our "selves" as within an objective world which we sense - as this is a highly functional model - consistent with the woven worlds of other organisms.  But, what the web of humans on Earth have done is to force an emergency emergence of global world woven humanity in intimate structural coupling with Gaia (of which we are also part).

We are each woven worlds, structurally coupling.  We exchange SEMS (semiotic structures). We interact with a Semiotic World (cyberspace+).

Humans evolved as social beings from when we were as prairie dogs; it is not a recent invention. Mammal brains are specialized for socialization and communication (structural coupling, at later stages).  Languaging (a process a la Maturana), now amplified by technology has kicked human emergence into a dimension/domain beyond the "biologically natural".  [Which is why the "evolution" metaphor is so inappropriate.]

I will refrain from further speculations at this time - postponed until later.  I come back to EDUCATION as the most challenging and difficult task. Now, we must imagine "education" to apply to the emergent network of structurally coupled woven worlds.  My own emergent woven world, which I call "nuet", has been working on this challenge for 4-5 decades. My current model/scenario I call UPLIFT, with the practical objective of "rapidly uplifting the distribution of cognitive competencies of all human populations in humankind".

I need to end this SEM at this point, but the process has only been initiated. I need assistance in constructing a platform where this "issue" can emerge with vitality and commitment. Are any Next Edgers here? http://fora.tv/live/being_human/being_human_2012?utm_source=BH&utm_medium=website_place&utm_campaign=BH2012 Preschool children, on average, ask their parents about 100 questions a day. Why, why, why—sometimes parents just wish it’d stop. Tragically, it does stop. By middle school they’ve pretty much stopped asking. It’s no coincidence that this same time is when student motivation and engagement plummet. To build on the John Hagel/John Seely Brown notion of corporations as learning centers, I've been focusing a lot of my advisory and development efforts around the idea of aligning the elements of brand, startup and social/cultural change. This post talks a bit about it in my new role as a mentor (and venture partner) with K5, an accelerator here in Southern California. I'm sure many of you will relate to this on various levels in your own work.

http://goonth.posterous.com/adventure-capital-brands-as-startups-and-star Aristotle, the philosopher of the golden mean, viewed excess as man's greatest weakness. He believed that one could only avoid excess through moderation. Great little interview with proponent of alt commerce and the end of paper currency, David Wolman. Have you ever come across those who tell you half-truths? Note: There are errors of commission & omission. A thief needn't steal an object! 36 years ago today in Argentina a military coup took place. Taking over 
30.000 young souls who were brave enough to actually change the world. 
We owe to them all around the world to know their history, because it´s the same history ever. 
The same struggle, different chips, but the same game. 
In latin america during the 20th century we´ve lost more than one millon people in orden to allow the settlement of an economic system. 
Nunca mas. Memoria.Verdad.Justicia Peace

That’s what we want isn’t it. Not all this violence and bloodshed and death and anger and deep crushing anguish of loss, unthinkable terrible throw you like a rag on the floor weeping loss.

That’s what Trayvon symbolizes. He’s the archetype for oppression. Oppression of women, of mothers. For what greater oppression can there possibly be than to take someone’s child for no fucking reason at all. Senselessly.

An innocent boy whose mother loved him so very much when she watched him laying on the bed so tiny and alive and scary. Who cleaned the shit off her dress after he sprayed her just before she was about to go out for the first time in weeks. Who cried when she heard the first words and realized they were for her.

Who beat herself inside every day when she was mean or short or didn’t have enough money to give her child the things she need.

Who laughed at him when he would hide his head under the edge of a diaper or bed sheet, laughing when they’d play peek a boo. Who tickled him until he giggled every night before she put him to bed.

That’s what we took from her. And all the other mothers, thousands of them, tens of thousands of them, millions of them every year, from senseless and unnecessary deaths. Preventable ones. And we are fucking it doing now.

Time to stop everything and take a stand. La Lysistrata even. No sex if you don’t march with me. End of story.

If a small group of Argentine grandmothers can take down a dictatorship funded by the CIA and U.S. military. Think what a group of connected, strong and powerful women can do.

So to all the strong powerful connected and beautiful women of the world, a question: Can you think of a time in your entire life that you felt ready to take a stand for women’s rights?

Or a time when you felt so close to losing everything you had fought so hard for?

Now is the time. You know it. I look forward to walking with you and learning from the women.

Here are the amazing Kiva robots Amazon just bought for $775 million to automate warehouse fulfillment..! http://ow.ly/9L6jy “What’s needed is a theory of how people make decisions as a function of interaction. Once you realize there are patterns, then you can predict outcomes” ~Sandy Pentland, Professor, MIT Media Lab, speaking at “ON Social” gathering at Deloitte University...
Methinks that may be a holy grail we never grasp, thank goodness, because of the may variables of being human. Take just two – context and the countless variations in alchemy between different mixes of people. Yet they many interactive moves I already see towards understanding what makes us get in sync, connect and understand the underlying behaviors that seem to make it possible are enormous leaps forward for conviviality, smarter collective decision making and sometimes even invention for the greater good Lots of us love Pinterest....this gives me a sad...and a scare.

http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-28/tech/31106641_1_repinning-copyright-entire-image Learning interventions that promote the careful analysis of problems and empower people to play an active part in their resolution can have significant effects on responses to social and environmental change problems. True? Announcing 'I'm offended' is basically telling the whole world we can't control our own emotions so everyone else should do it for us! “More data often makes more complex problems simpler” ~ John Seely Brown Our world is at crisis. Global challenges abound. Cybernetics, systems research, the sciences of complexity – all of them have the potential to endow the subjects of history with guidance and a means for mastering the current transformation. But the readiness of cybernetic, systems and complex thinking for the tasks ahead has to be continuously reassessed and improved. The time has come to reflect on the aims, the scope and the tools of a multitude of approaches. Platforms for the self-understanding of the whole field are needed now more than ever. OK so. Here's something that I've been listening to recently, that many of you may find HUGELY helpful in your work. 

A disclaimer: please trust me. I know what it looks like, and I had the same reaction, but I urge you to overlook it.  I refuse to let the horrible, horrible advertising/aesthetics/snakeoil salesman thing that is, as I think I've said before, so inherent in so much of "self-help" culture, for lack of a better word, and skip ahead to some of these replay teachings. 

What really resonated with me, as I listened today to a chakra clearing, (and why I chose, after months of using this without posting it, to share it today) was the request in this session that users acknowledge and take a second to accelerate the potential power of shared, focused, energetic INTENTION, and invite others to participate. And I realised that even if my audience/network didn't listen or click, that by sharing I would create a momentary shift via asking others to consider the potential power of a vast, connected energetic practice {this is being done also by the Global Coherence Initiative, which some of us have pointed to previously: http://www.glcoherence.org/ ]

It's crucial to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff where this sort of information is concerned -- so many healers and teachers have simply taught themselves the languages of this time and place, and thereby the ones of us who try to stay away from "selling" are turned off by it. 

By allowing myself to see past that language and feel the essence, and the energy/intention behind this work, and in particular acknowledging the value of the huge number of practitioners gathered here, I feel it is right to share it with you -- that I must, in fact, share with you this resource. Here's some of the language they put forth, and the link. I'd be happy to tell you what replays have been most useful for me. Thank you for holding attention, time and space to read and consider this:

"What if we could...

The downside of mobility..... "While education has been framed as the cure to this crisis, in reality, the factory model of schooling is part of the problem. Around the world, education systems have become commercialized 'businesses' which serve to stratify society, glorify militarism, devalue local knowledge systems and languages, manufacture unsustainable wants, breed discontent and frustration, stifle creativity, motivation and expression, and dehumanize communities. The 19th-century model of factory-schooling today stands in the way of building organic learning societies for the 21st century." Ode to Hub culture.

https://vimeo.com/38968381 The Five Personalities of Innovators: Which One Are You? - Forbes http://onforb.es/GEZEGc so i was just chatting with Tammy Chan and had a realization that perhaps there is a cultural axis that runs from fear to celebration. Some cultures are fear cultures and some are celebration cultures... let us make things smaller v let us create something special...  I don't want to be part of a fear culture.. i think that there is a natural talent osmosis that means that talent is drawn away from fear cultures and towards celebration cultures (perhaps play cultures is another frame for the 2nd pole...) (cc Tricia Choi) I came to a realization today, money and currencies/expressive capacities, at their core, are just a technology/language/'sense' of interactive, social, and methodological goal-setting.

What a great idea. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems.

BIG BANG THEORY
And the day came
when the black balloon of Silencing
could not hold another voice.

But the mouth of Greed isn't fond of limits
so it laughed in the face of its
straining rubber blackness,
pregnant with Other
ways of seeing
of doing
of being, here together.

For even in the dark, without names
we found each other, and the way
to hold the hands around us.
You cannot see the world we have built
for you have defined the word "invisible"
but language is Chaos, and cannot be owned.

And on this day,
the black balloon of Silencing
was full to bursting:
its interior hot with our love for each other;
with our refusal to see
by Greed's artificial light.

For we bask in our own, huddled here together.
And we have not forgotten how to listen.

Then: music to our ears, pop fizz!
It is music to our ears, the fissure the blowhards ignore:

a subtle sizzle of air

like a single drop of water on a too-hot pan.

Slow at first, then an explosion of breath, and
on a wind of 1's and 0's we found again our voices:

and the word rebels yelled
and the art rebels yelled
and the child rebels yelled
and the woman rebels yelled
and the queer rebels yelled
and the spiritual rebels yelled
and the dark rebels yelled
and the pale rebels yelled
and the young rebels yelled
and the old rebels yelled:

YES! WE ARE!

And the voices grew to reach all ears,
a giant babel birdsong; a symphony
at once sweet and furious,
soothing even Greed's bleeding ears.

                                      The bubble has burst.

It cannot be reblown in its own image
nor reWritten. history is not capitalized,
and try as you may to keep us from your pages
they hold little water on this rushing river.

Point, counterpoint: peals of golden laughter like a spring rain:
the joy of our collective child
finding itself free

http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/201111-00_WIREs-SysBiology/201111-00_WIREs-SysBiology.pdf Dear Edgers, I have just filed in an application for a Knight Foundation News Challenge grant to develop A pull platform to engage for the commons and build emerging forms of governance based on agency. It is a project I have abundantly discussed with many of you in TNE and that will require input from the best thinkers and doers around if we get it through. This will provide an opportunity to put to work for a common outcome many of the projects that are being developed here. Don't hesitate to like and comment if you support this idea so that we can continue the conversation in an 'activation' mode. Thank you.

"This is why open source communities have created a new social institution: the for-benefit association.

This is an important social innovation, because, unlike classic non-profits or non-governmental institutions, they do not operate from the point of view of scarcity. Classic NGOs still operate much like other industrial institutions, such as the corporation and the market state, as they believe that resources need to marshalled and managed. By contrast, the new for-benefits have only an active role in enabling and empowering the community to co-operate - by provisioning its infrastructure, not by commanding its production processes. These associations exist for the sole purpose of benefitting the community of which they are the expression. This is good news, as they are generally managed in democratic ways. And they have to be, because an undemocratic institution would discourage contributions by the community of participants.

Here is the kicker. What would you call an institution that is responsible for the common good of all the participants? I would argue that this type for for-benefit institution has a very similar function to what we commonly assign to the state." Why deal with problems immediately? Nothing kills team morale more quickly than problems that don't get addressed. Small problems turn big! Dear Edgers!

Or take a guess on this question of the week: How much did it cost Mobil and its partners to build the world’s largest oil-drilling platform, a 1.2 million-ton monster that sits in 300 feet of water in “Iceberg Alley” in the Canadian North Atlantic and is armored with sixteen protective “teeth” designed to absorb the impact of those approaching bergs?  The answer: $5 billion for the Hibernia platform, which is now producing 135,000 barrels of deep sea oil per day.

If you wanted, you could spend your time turning Michael Klare’s new book, The Race for What’s Left: The Global Scramble for the World’s Last Resources, into an energy and resources version of Believe It Or Not that would stagger your friends.  Klare has a way of landing us on a strange new planet called Earth, one stripped to its disappearing resources and filled with insatiable greed.  It’s always a bracing experience, even when, as he assures us in his new book, the rush to the planet’s Iceberg Alleys to provide energy for the US military and the rest of us fuel guzzlers may be the last “race” of its kind we are likely to undertake."

International Conference on TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING
November 1-4, 2012, San Francisco, California

Proposals due April 10, 2012

About the Conference: The future of the earth and its people are inextricably woven together. Profound transformations are currently underway on many dimensions: personal, ecological, cultural, societal, and economic. To 
engage these challenges and opportunities, we must collaboratively re-imagine how individuals, institutions, and societies can learn new capacities and habits of being. We envision the upcoming Tenth International Conference on Transformative Learning as an opportunity to create a more coherent and dynamic praxis for transformative learning in multiple domains and at multiple levels; praxis weaves together theory and practice, action and reflection. We will gather to articulate a more inclusive and clear vision of what we already know, and to explore what we can discover together, about the role of transformative learning in creating a just and sustainable future.

Your input really counts.  Please help us bring it, Neal Gorenflo Has anyone used Adobe Muse to build a website? What was your experience? The subject of Jevons' Paradox came up recently on a thread here. A nice summary from the Psy-Fi blog of this crucial concept, and the challenge it poses to reaping the wide-scale benefits of sustainability efforts such as energy efficiency:

"So we’re caught in a trap. On one hand the only method available to the free market of conserving fuel resources is by increasing the efficiency of resource use, but this leads to the Jevons paradox, that more resource gets used. Government intervention is then required to ensure that efficiency leads to less fuel use, but this restricts economic growth; which is anathema to democratic governments whose future re-election depends on making people feel happy. The only real solution to this is to address the underlying culture of consumption that’s linked to free market economics." "What does it mean to truly transform our systems- ourselves included - so that they are deeply sustainable, at all levels?"

http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2010/12/time-preference-and-emergent.html Global Social Tourism – Call for Partners and Participants 
 
Global Social Tourism is a global business venture linking the world’s communities, travellers, social enterprises, businesses, and institutions in a unique collaborative development of social tourism. 

By 'social tourism', we mean social and business activity that: 

a. builds on social connections to introduce communities to travellers and travellers to communities with the aim of providing rich social and cultural experiences; 
b. develops interactions, trust, learning, and social relationships between travellers and communities; and 
c. provides substantial financial and social benefits to host communities. 

We aim to develop a Global Social Tourism 'brand' to identify social tourism ventures which: 

1. provide opportunities for travellers to interact with local people through social experiences, cultural events, education, volunteering opportunities, tours, accommodation, food, and hospitality; 
2. provide opportunities for disadvantaged people and communities to connect with travellers and participate in global tourism markets; and 
3. signal to travellers that products and services carrying the brand are generated by groups or social enterprises which benefit the producers and their communities, and operate in an ethical manner. 

Global Social Tourism is being developed by an international working group comprising people from every continent. The Working Group is calling for expressions of interest from groups, organisations and businesses in building this collaborative venture in the following capacities (use the online form below to express your interest): 

a. Host Communities 
b. Social Tourism Broker/Providers 
c. Travel Agents 
d. Booking Agents 
e. Partners 
f. Developers 
g. Supporters 

http://www.partnerships.org.au/SocialTourism0312.htm 

Individuals and organisations may also wish to contribute to the Global Working Group which is conducting its work through four sub-groups. Dear friends, I'm conducting a fundraising to solve some temporary issues and continue my engagement with the p2p work. Your support would be most appreciated. 12 people contribute $500 so far.

I am concerned with the number of challenges and contests that pit brilliant, like-minded ppl against each other. My desire for exploring approaches that generate innovation cooperatively vs competitively is growing stronger every minute. 

Competition is a 50 yard dash. To participate in the marathon that is "sustainability" we must work cooperatively from the start - not patch it on afterward, as if we can stuff the effort's competitive beginnings back into the can.  I am convinced that "competition breeds innovation" is an incomplete thought - that cooperation ALSO breeds innovation - and that we need to experiment and provide case studies and demonstrate what that looks like.

These two ingredients shape how a government interacts with its citizens; how officials, politicians, and businesspeople behave; and how effective foreign efforts to upgrade governance will be. Together with the set of policies adopted by the government, they make up the three major determinants of a country’s capacity to advance."

A great video from 30 years ago of Peter Russell talking about the implications of the internet connecting us into a single global brain... Oh dear... Hi Edgers!  Well, here goes.

I am Kyle Sykes. I am a student-apprentice/up and coming entrepreneur that wants to help create ideologies and design new platforms (working edge brands in action) for and around such things as:  open source education, decorums, makerlabs, collabtories, gamification, commons entrepreneurship incubation, agile coaching, resilient communities, hosting, superhero/'global 'schools, qualification, culture hacking, open spaces, vocations, idea diffusion, hackerspaces, badges, and chronic or independent learning.  

I am looking for mentorship in all schools of thought and practices so I can can build or add to these platforms. In the process, I then get add to the credentials and education I require to become qualified in different specialization and disciplines ( which mentors are qualified in or can at least teach), fields and subjects, ones I would be taught if I went to a traditional school. This is to get the knowledge and wisdom required to become autonomous, as in a true professional, which is recognized as educated ( being able to do 'shift'.)  

Personal misfortunes aside I want to be able to work, get trained, coached, and educated, network and create new relationships, regardless of the present circumstances of the status quo. These mentorships can be centered on chosen terms of agreement and mutual basis. Right now, I am stuck being in the center of that awkward space between the present world and edge based world, in transition, where things get blurred. For example, like what can be defined as a real and legit education during the shift.

This is an edge brand and a use of recursion in and of itself:  as in learning the things I want and need to become a professional through building on education as we know it. For multiple reasons, I think this is the best place to begin. 

I am aspiring to becoming a modern renaissance man. I am working on edge branding in order to get a better idea on what it is I want to do. For now, I am seeking mentorship. I am using open source learning, self-education, curation, and meta-design to create genuine source-material and powerful knowledge products to earn some thought leadership.

The goal is to become proficient in different schools of thought, able to use cross-referencing of disciplines when engaged in serious meaningful action. When I start to 'get it' and its time, I will then become a working pioneer and commons entrepreneur.  There is still much to learn. I know TNE has people working and doing all kinds of things, in all kinds of places, from all walks of life. I do not see this is as limitation, but something which creates mutual benefit, depending on common interests.

For those who might be interested in mentoring, please contact me at massinception@gmail.com.  My skype is tempestflux,  edgers please do not hesitate to send a personal message.

There are some potiencial and to-be mentors in the works, but not much has been established at this point. There is a lot going on, I need to be more clear sometimes, and I know that will happen soon enough. There can multiple agreements and mentorship going on at one time. If something comes to mind... and I don't care how long it lasts, if its paid or not (or offers little, because I do need to be able to take care of small bills, think of it as a stipend or microscholarship, I am searching for work but something in the edge would be ideal), please let me know. 

Education, knowledge, talents, wisdom, and niches are the things I am seeking. Well I put it out there, I hope the ideas people come up with becomes something more than I can imagine, and then we can build on that.  This can also be chance for us edgers to make a better world for education- together. Interesting blog... RT @mbauwens: Clay Shirky: asymmetric competition in the political sphere | @scoopit via @P2P_Foundation http://t.co/WWALqlJg A friend of mine asked me today a question. To paraphrase: What social innovations exist today that have already had a profound impact on a portion of global society (lets say having had a positive impact already on thousands or millions of people) that have at least 10 or 100 or 1000 times more potential going forward to impact further people positively and have been under-reported so far. I was thinking about this and I realized that it would be an interesting brainstorm for Next Edgers. Initial thoughts that came to mind were Ushahidi or The Harlem Children's Zone. I was also thinking about Mitra Ardron's work and whether some of his innovations around getting people access to water may or might at some point meet these criteria. Thoughts?

Dear Optimist, Pessimist, and Realist... Gotta Love Social Objects!:  Harnessing the Gravitational Pull of Social Objects to Create Word-of-Mouth | Social Media Today  

"What are social objects? A social object is a conversation piece that inherently generates conversation and action around itself."
...
"All social objects have 3 things in common, they are:

    "Conversational: people want to talk and have conversations with other people connected with the social object.
    "Brings People Together: people want to be around other people that are connected with the social object. They feel part of a community, that they belong with each other.
    'Talk Worthy: people feel the desire to tell other people, who may not know about the social object, so that they, in turn, become part of the community."
...
Speak of Social Objects. It speaks about social causes, lifestyles, & what customers are passionate about.

"Khan Academy, the wildly popular Youtube lecture series, is slated to launch its iPad app any minute now in Apple's store. The enhanced version of Khan Academy will include time-syncing between devices--no Internet connection required, an interactive transcript of the lectures for easy searching, and a handy scrubber for moving between parts of the lectures. Perhaps more importantly, now that more schools have begun adopting Khan's lectures for their own classrooms, the free iPad app could possibly replace or supplement textbooks, saving cash-strapped schools and students a lot of money."
...
Really, I have experienced it first-hand: Khan Academy is a first-rate institution, perhaps the first of a new breed of self-sustaining, futuristic institution. I have learned to program in Python from the Khan Academy website, as well as brushed up on my Probability and Calculus. It is unbelievable how great these video lectures are. And it's at the head of a whole new movement of "free online courses", maybe it is the true "coming-of-age" of e-Learning 3.0? Further to the conversations around Kony 2012, I'd submit this as an example of a (much cheaper) well-constructed narrative that doesn't treat its audience like a 4-year old by abstracting away all the complexity, and yet still gets its message across in terms that non-experts can understand. It also happens to be an issue that will negatively affect the lives of far more people than the Kony does. 1:0 for the people, connected.

If you believe a new pandemic may be on the way, check and maybe share this:

By Jon Rappoport, investigative reporter.

"Here are the best official statistics I could dig up for the phony epidemics I’ve been talking about. These numbers are global, and cumulative:

SARS: 774 deaths.
WEST NILE: 1,088 deaths
BIRD FLU: 262 deaths
SWINE FLU (H1N1): 25,000 deaths.

Keep in mind that the CDC claims ordinary seasonal flu in the US kills 36,000 people a year, and the World Health Organization states that ordinary seasonal flu kills between 300,000 and 500,000 people a year, globally. NONE of that is called an epidemic.

Quite interesting. Quite instructive. What it tells you is this: the phony epidemics are largely PR and propaganda campaigns. They’re launched and funded and maintained to condition people to Medical Authority. Operant conditioning, mind control, brainwashing.

However, the wild card in all this is the Internet. During the last go-around with Swine Flu, there were enough of us who blew the whistle on the CDC and the World Health Organization to derail the whole operation. Governments and their medical partners were screaming and ranting and lying on every front, and it didn’t work. We exposed their lies, chapter and verse. We demonstrated that the “level-six pandemic” was a fraud.

The non-official media won.

Millions of people started to wake up from their trance.

So now the medical/government honchos don’t know what to do. They want to launch another phony epidemic, and I’m sure they will. But they don’t know how to promote it. They’re gagging on their own lies. They’re searching for newer and better methods of propaganda.

The vaccine manufacturers are furious. They struck a deal some years ago with governments that would allow them to keep making vaccines at a high rate of profit, sell those vaccines to governments with a no-return policy, and avoid huge lawsuits when people who took the vaccines died…they were riding high. But now?

The governments and their propaganda machines didn’t deliver. They fell down on the job. They lost the information war. To us. And now we’re ready to pounce on the next load of insanity and de-certify it. We know where the lies are. We can expose them.

This is a model to emulate in other venues. Other issues can be dealt with in this way. "

Hi Next Edgers - I am looking for a little help from fantastic brains to my research paper: "The non-sustainability of economic growth in the industrialized part of civilization - a need for new values and differentiated growth in a finite system"

I am currently looking for good research and sources to address the following areas of my research - and it is here I would love your intelligent brains to help me: 

1. The origins of the addition to growth - mainly focusing on the industrialized revolution.

2. The problems of altering values is society - mainly focusing on the psychology of humans and the capitalistic system that maintains the social structure and necessity to increased consumption and strive for materialism.

3. Research on the scarcity of resources (flow- and stock resources) and the implications hereof. 

4. Research on the theory of the need for differentiated growth in a finite system. 

Thank you very much in advance for your help with my research. Good & Gasp #2 - Social Impact Bonds, Enviro-investing, Prediction Markets http://t.co/enLenIpl So what skills do we really need to be able to affect change? 
And how do we get them?

Transitioning from school to work opened up a whole new world for me. As did moving into a government institution-space. As much as I hope I am prepared, I discover there are so many things any kind of formalised education can't really teach me. Like dealing with work relations; managing conflicts or competition; group dynamics that not only differ from my previous experiences, but differ from one work place to another. After many discussions with friends, colleagues and my network we all came to the conclusion that explore this in Edgeryders, peer-to-peer. 

So I'm starting by exploring the learning challenges and lessons of the first period at work, and ask that you describe an experience where you made the first step into any new position, learning for the first time ‘on the job’. You may have been employed, or an intern, or being mentored, or trying to develop a project of your own, or made a transition from studying a profession to practicing it.

How were you guided by others more experienced than yourself? How did you feel about the challenge? Was it challenging enough? Did anything go wrong and did you learn anything from it? What might have helped you learn more quickly? You can describe your own experience, or someone else’s, or both. More stories will earn you more points!

Good for you: Take this opportunity to reflect on what you have learned and how you grew outside of school, and feel good about yourself. It’s something that’s far from being easy! 

Good for everyone: Your reflections can help those that are younger to know what to expect and better prepare for their first work experience, lower or increase expectations accordingly; plus, you may just become a mentor for one of us Edgeryders!

So how do you participate?
It’s easy! You could just send me your reflections in an email to:

And yet our schools are churning out kids who are stuck looking for jobs where the boss tells them exactly what to do. Nobel prize–winning economist Michael Spence makes this really clear: there are tradable jobs (doing things that could be done somewhere else, like building cars, designing chairs, and answering the phone) and non-tradable jobs (like mowing the lawn or cooking burgers). Is there any question that the first kind of job is worth keeping in our economy? Alas, Spence reports that from 1990 to 2008, the U.S. economy added only 600,000 tradable jobs."

Out of Control is a summary of what we know about self-sustaining systems, both living ones such as a tropical wetland, or an artificial one, such as a computer simulation of our planet. The last chapter of the book, "The Nine Laws of God," is a distillation of the nine common principles that all life-like systems share. The major themes of the book are:

-As we make our machines and institutions more complex, we have to make them more biological in order to manage them.

-The most potent force in technology will be artificial evolution. We are already evolving software and drugs instead of engineering them.

-Organic life is the ultimate technology, and all technology will improve towards biology.

-The main thing computers are good for is creating little worlds so that we can try out the Great Questions. Online communities let us ask the question "what is a democracy; what do you need for it?" by trying to wire a democracy up, and re-wire it if it doesn't work. Virtual reality lets us ask "what is reality?" by trying to synthesize it. And computers give us room to ask "what is life?" by providing a universe in which to create computer viruses and artificial creatures of increasing complexity. Philosophers sitting in academies used to ask the Great Questions; now they are asked by experimentalists creating worlds.

-As we shape technology, it shapes us. We are connecting everything to everything, and so our entire culture is migrating to a "network culture" and a new network economics.

-In order to harvest the power of organic machines, we have to instill in them guidelines and self-governance, and relinquish some of our total control." One and the All: Mingle and move

I have felt uneasy about the concept of the 'Lab' in social innovation for some time. It's come to mean a funded space in which experimentation and innovation can be conducted in a pseudo-scientific manner to produce designs or formulae for system-changing social betterment. 

But for me, it suggests white-coated scientists experimenting to find 'evidence' of what will better society, so that the results can be bottled and sent off to communities to 'improve' human lives. These images are slightly disturbing. I'm afraid I can't get some of the Third Reich imagery out of my mind, with its experimentation on ways to solve the "problems" of disability and ethnicity. 

Historically, all of the major social innovations that we are familiar with have occured through processes that are arguably the opposite of the 'Lab' process - highly contextualised rather than spawned in artificial laboratory conditions; generated by users through participatory processes rather than through professional designers and facilitators; self-generated through DIY discovery rather than externally funded by governments or investors. 

I feel there is a deep contradiction between the desire for an application of 'science' in laboratory conditions to produce 'evidence' of social betterment, and the extensive rhetorical reference in much social innovation discourse to "participatory user-centric" processes. The latter do not emerge from "labs" - they emerge from the experiences and collaborations of people in homes, neighbourhoods, hospitals, schools, pubs and cafes.

"Economists build models by what they call “abstraction”. But it’s really subtraction. They look at a real world situation and subtract from it the characteristics they deem unessential. The result is a bare bones description consisting of what economists deem economically essential. Everything that is discarded (not taken into consideration in the model) is called an “externality”. So the models only work when the externalities that were in effect before the models are implemented do not change afterward." http://zatavu.blogspot.com/2010/01/on-beauty-and-feeling-at-home-in.html What doing work I love feels like most days.

One distinction between meanings relates to time frames.  It is said that new order emerges at the edge of chaos. "The Origins of Order" by Stuart Kauffman (1993).  Ilya Prigogine got his Nobel Prize for demonstrating emergence in a chemical reaction: "Order Out of Chaos" (1984). At the EDGE we see the dynamic phenomena of order appearing, seemingly spontaneously, from a dance of many potentials.  This is the process I view happening in Emergent-by-Design and The Next Edge, and personally find very exciting - much of the reality quite beyond my ability to comprehend.  This is emergence in the Here&Now.  There is also the concept of emergence unfolding in time.

In 1975 when I first proposed Societal Metamorphosis as a model for significant global change, I made a sharp distinction between transFORMation and emergence, as exemplified in the emergence of the butterfly. The butterfly doesn't result from a transFORMation of the caterpillar.  The caterpillar doesn't morph into the butterfly.  It doesn't slim down, sprout wings and spindly legs. There is a deep inner process where some cellular components of the organism (imaginal buds) commence self-organization and merge to form the butterfly emerging within the decaying form of the caterpillar. The butterfly form replaces the caterpillar form, it doesn't transform it.

I was concerned, as an activist, that although activist movements emerged (in the first sense, above) they continued to envision as endgame the transFORMation of the existing societal systems.  I speculated that the nature of our overly complex and highly dysfunctional societal system was scientifically impossible to significantly transform.  When a part is improved by reform it causes disturbance in the whole, resulting in a backlash to block spread of the improvement. Defense mechanisms are too powerful for significant transformation of large, overly complex, and highly dysfunctional systems.  Yet, activist movements continued in their front line work without consideration of a realistic endgame.  Part of this may be because the term "transformation" had become the label for the highest form of change in New Age culture - and it remains so today.

My take on the emergence/transFORMation distinction came from my academic work in physics and mathematics.  I first encountered the term "transformation" in mathematics. A mathematical form (expression) is operated on and changed (transFORMed) into a new form. Oldform to Newform, and in sequence. One can claim that "scientific explanation" must be in terms of mechanistic transformation.  As yet, there is no science of origination.

My take on "emergence" also came from physics. Thermodynamics is viewed as empirical patterns emergent from the theories of statistical mechanics.  Historically the laws of thermodynamics preceded statistical mechanics. But, mathematically, the equations of thermodynamics emerged from manipulations on the equations of statistical mechanics (the dynamics of material particles in collision).

Thus, I define "emergence" to be a process whereby a form spontaneously appears where there was no prior form to be transformed. Most of human creativity is emergence.  Once a new form emerges it is subject to transformation. Reality is a complex dance of emergence and transformation. A new science must emerge for this "larger" reality.

The transformation paradigm is very powerful, even among those most supportive of emergence.  It is very easy to slip back to seeking transformation, which anchors one to old forms as dominant contexts.
 
 An example is the paradigmatic power of economics and finance.  Many emergents envision their efforts leading to a transformation of financial and economic systems to forms radically different; but they start with existing forms. Modern civilization is obsessively econo-centric (what is good for GM is good for the country). In analogy to a biological organism, econo-centrism would deify the digestive system, obese is beautiful and don't worry about mobility or where you shit.  Capitalism, socialism, and communism are all econo-centric models.
 
 We are so indoctrinated into thinking econo-centrism that it is difficult imaging alternatives. Healthy and viable societies must have healthy economic systems, but their whole need not be dictated by them.  I play with an alternative where a strong societal subsystem is education redefined as "organizing-for-learning-&-learning-for-organizing".  This may be the core program for a new emergent humanity, where finance and markets follow.  Yet, the moment emergents begin discussing new societal forms, they focus on economics and finance.
 
 Another lockin to old forms is the confusion of a governance subsystem with a governmental component. The transformation paradigm calls for the establishment of a new government to manage the transformation which immediately precludes the participation in governance by all components of the system.
 
 This has led me to design a program of UPLIFT.  Economic-financial systems for populations where the vast majority lack sufficient competencies to participate in global decisions would be vastly different if the global population were rapidly uplifting in a distribution of relevant competencies.  IMHO, unless the whole population is competent in being active participants and contributors, humankind will always be dangerously unstable and unable to prepare for the challenges in the coming millennia (super volcanic eruptions, asteroid collisions, epidemics, earth changes) or to take real advantage of our awesome potentials.
 
IMHO the forms of human organization necessary for our multi-millennial survival/thrival cannot come from a transformation of our contemporary order.  This does not mean that reform efforts need be abandoned.  Often reform will be necessary to enable to societal butterfly to emerge without being destroyed by the collapsing societal caterpillar. And once new forms emerge transformation is essential for the necessary "precision-of-fit" for viability. It is just that we don't put all our eggs in the basket of somehow transforming the existing societal order into a new order meeting our criteria.
 
 If one considers the self-organized populations necessary to pressure a successful transformation of traditional society, one should consider whether it might be actually better to simply consider continuing spreading self-organizing to more people and replace, not transform, the old order.
 
 I actually encourage efforts to explore transformation solutions, although I personally view them as highly improbable.
 
 What is essential is that efforts exploring a metamorphic emergence be also on the agenda of emergents.
 
 It is not necessary that all emergents, those working within the first definition of emergence, contribute explicitly to this agenda.  It is hoped only that they would agree that efforts of some exploring the agenda of metamorphic emergence be supported. Nice new skills endorsement /trust net interface - elegant really... except the part when I seemingly have endorsed myself still - take a look - http://www.skills.to WE ARE WORLDS
Might it be that the laws governing hypothetical social worlds (beyond the immediate, local, concrete, and tangible) are quite different than what we expect - in analogy to how quantum weirdness appears when we explore the hypothetical domains of the very small?
I propose the practical adoption of a complementarity between two perspective on the use of the term "world".  This posting is long and complex - but the magnitude of our challenge calls us to explore.
 1] Traditional: We are individual beings living on a common objective world. We each have different experiences with different parts of this external world and develop subjective beliefs as to our world and reality. Most people believe their subjective view of the world closely approximates objective reality. Others who differ have warped perceptions and biased thinking.
 2] Alternative: We are each "worlds" (which I will call "wrlds"), which contain representatives of  our "self" and "others". Extending Maturana & Varela's concept of Autopoesis, we are each "Autopoetic Wrlds" who interact by "structural coupling". In simple terms, each person is totally self organizing, even incapable of exchanging information; the alternative for interaction being a coupling of structures.
 Speculative theoretic "complexes of many wrlds" are possible; but they need not have the characteristics of either everyday or scientific wrlds.
 At this stage of human challenge, consideration of a meta-objectivity is probably both a waste of time and potentially disruptive.

THE TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVE - AN OBJECTIVE WORLD
 The traditional perspective is usually adequate when working with our immediate environments: what we directly perceive and can agree to usage of terms with gestures. Since we are mobile and can experience many different immediate environments we construct an extended world of many immediate environments. We experience changes in immediate environments and generalize that changes could be occurring everywhere. We also directly perceive patterns of social behavior.
 Humans have special innate competencies for social perception and behavior, built upon our tools for perceiving objects.
 There is a wide diversity among persons in their competencies for social perception (and controlling behavior in social settings). This is a mix of inheritance and learning.  This diversity is critical when we consider wrlds.
 Humans infer from their local social perception (in the context of their experienced physical environment) traditional social processes.
 For example, we observe and often participate in social environments such a classroom, a worksite, a sporting event, a dance, etc.  We infer from these to theoretical entities such as schools, businesses, sport and entertainment systems - on to corporations, governments, and globalization. We erroneously attribute an empirical reality to these theoretical entities.
 All this is very concrete and tangible.  Persons with different ideologies and backgrounds may initially interpret the same concrete setting differently - but with gestures they can come to common agreement as to what their immediate physical and social environments "really" are, even if they give them different values and interpretations. This was a fully adequate perspective for humans in tribal settings and for relating to both their natural and human constructed environments.
 Trouble begins when we project our models of concrete, tangible worlds on theoretical structures and systems that cannot be perceived or gestured about.  Humans are prone to imagine objective worlds filled with things and behaviors that they can't see or point to; but yet believe that they know of them - with the same confidence they have for their immediate environments.  This is most troublesome for large social systems and collective human behavior.
 We seem to have muddled along midst this confusion; yet who knows what the past millennia would have been like had we been able to distinguish between what we can empirically confirm mutually and what is inferred and requiring a different process for coming to agreement.  IMHO our Crisis-of-Crises is a direct product of this confusion and our survival/thrival depends on inventing/learning ways of working with this distinction.

AUTOPOETIC WRLDS
 Each of us lives in rich wrlds. [Our languages emerged for communicating in the traditional perspective and is clumsy when attempting to be used to share alternatives.] We cannot experience our wrlds, only small parts. Some wrlds emit experientials, the emission being the experiential.  Other wrlds have conscious selves that experience parts of their wrlds. Scientific wrlds postulate patterns of neural activity in brains that are associated with experientials and with an organization of the woven wrld - containing everything we (part of our wlrd) knows. Contemporary science (within wrlds) confirms we cannot have direct access to a hypothesized external world. Other wrlds may claim direct access beyond perception to "others"; but these claims cannot be confirmed for others.  We are autopoetic wrlds that contains autopoetic beings living in a hypothesized world.
 This appears very strange, but we can continue to function in our immediate, concrete, tangible environments - where we have local relations with others and continue to do as we always have (maybe improving).  It is just that we must accept that EVERYTHING beyond the tangible is hypothetical and may well not be as we imagine.
 SEMS [Semiotic Structures: Symbolic patterns in our immediate physical environments that catalyze experientials with "meaning" (a node in wrld).  Our exemplar will be patterns we observe on a screen or page: text, graphics, video sequences.]
 All that we claim to know about what is beyond the immediate we infer from perceiving SEMS and conceptualizing on our experiences. Reports are concrete emissions from other wrlds attempting to relate their experientials.
 SEMS have the unique character of being replicable and the accuracy of replication confirmable through direct observation and gesture. Persons may disagree as to the interpretation or meaning of a SEM, but there are procedures where they can agree that replications are accurate.
 How might groups of wrlds decide on common action?  All SEMS relevant to the issue are collected and processed by intelligent technologies into summary SEMS capable of being perceived within each wrld.  A process then facilities dialog between wrlds, an exchange of more SEMS, until there is an agreement on a set of actions, which would include proposals for further sessions.  What is critical in all this is there is no assertion about TRUTH or an OBJECTIVE REALITY beyond the system of SEMS.
 There may arise from this process a set of actions; some that may appear contradictory from a traditional perspective.
 We have the technology today to begin exploring this alternative.

STRANGE WRLDS
 When we stray beyond the immediate, concrete, and tangible we discover that hypothetical systems in our wrlds may follow different "laws". Quantum weirdness in the micro world is our exemplar. The many anomalies in the observations of the "universe of cosmology" hint that major shifts in the "laws of the large" are in process. Concepts of multiple universes now explored in both quantum and cosmological domains (at root, structures in the wrlds of those who encountered relevant SEMS) may have some weird applicability in hypothesizing new laws for multiple wrlds.  Similarly, the laws of psychology in our immediate perceptual wrlds may not apply to actions of our wrlds that transcend the ordinary, like sharing across paradigm differences, comprehending creative insights and swarming collective behavior.
 As a new humanity emerges (hopefully by design), we must be open to the possibility that the "nature" of social systems, cultures, and institutions may violate the nature of laws from the immediate.
 For example, we tend to treat institutions as objects with firm boundaries, with roles and persons performing to roles. This "classical" view may be very limiting, both in comprehending the ultra complex global-to-local phenomena we struggle with from the SEMS we each experience and as we design the equivalent of institutions and societal systems for emergent humanity.
 An alternative view, as but one example of many, would postulate an ecology of  "conspiratorial gangs" with roots in our tribal heritage. Institutions might behave in ways quite inconsistent from their formal, hypothesized structure, where officials in that structure may have no knowledge or influence in what happens.
 The increasing polarity of wrlds (e.g., Tea Party vs Progressives) emerges in pockets of exclusive SEMS.  Maybe, how this plays out may better be comprehended using quantum probabilities where alternative realities actually "exist" and interfere according to laws unknown.

IS THERE TIME TO PLAY?
 Is this a disruptive diversion?  Is there time for some people to play with these alternative ideas? Might it be that, from altered contexts strategies that looked very difficult from a traditional perspective might be practical from new perspectives? Do we really know what is happening that we can be comfortable sticking to our traditional views of reality?
 Back to COMPLEMENTARITY, a concept I view as the most significant from the 20th Century; but still unknown to most.  Complementarity states that "reality - whatever it is" -cannot be represented by a single, logically consistent explanatory system. At least two, potentially contradictory schemes are needed that interact in ways yet unknown. Bohr in 1926 demonstrated that the data of empirical physics required a complementarity perspective. Bohr's speculation that complementarity apply to domains beyond physics was not well received.
 It is fully proper to use the traditional perspective in our daily, immediate, concrete and tangible interactions. We shift to the alternatives when considering hypothesized systems beyond the immediate and difficult for confirming agreement. This is like my being well versed with the metric system when working in science but a total klutz when asked to use metric in everyday situations.  I am bilingual re measurement, but can't translate.
 This is one (of many hundreds) of alternative speculative themes that have emerged within my wrld (which Larry calls nuet) over the decades. No SEMS or sets of SEMS seem to portray their potential significance. This text emerged from nuet for this posting and doesn't contain references to other documents created in prior decades related to this topic. http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679423/the-2012-ted-prize-will-fund-ways-to-remake-our-cities The link to this GlobalGEA webinar was posted on Monday, but it's starting in ten minutes, on the off chance there's folks interested now in tuning in.

(this was posted by me in another facebook group, but i'm crossposting here per request of Mark Frazier. the content is copied heavily from a chakra book i have. i posted this as something for us to reflect upon in self-inquiry. i personally struggle with the imbalances at each level.)

Someone asked us to map disfunction (imbalance), adaptive response to disfunction, and healthy variation in our emerging social world.

I believe our social worlds are a reflection of our internal worlds. 

I'll posit that disfunction is a result of misaligned energy flows, leading/living from a fear-based mentality, and suffering due to the illusion of separation. I'll map to the chakra system for orientation purposes and convenience, though other frames are useful:

a. Root (Survival) - our animal nature; the root of our being and deepest connection to our bodies and the earth

healthy perspective: when balanced, you know what environments your physical being thrives in, and your survival happens naturally and gracefully. you've located yourself within the larger flow of life.

imbalance: "Trust no one.", insecurity, fear of insufficiency, buying into the cultural notion that security is a "defense posture"

adaptive response: attempting to fit into a life that others think is appropriate without sufficient self-analysis to determine if these situations actually meet their true needs

healthy variation: discovering one's own needs by honest introspection and self-awareness, leading to a sense of safety, knowledge of how to ground one's being, feeling connected to the body and planet, and an acute awareness of the instincts that protect the self

b.) Sacral (Pleasure)

healthy perspective: animated by magnetism, opening to the enjoyment of the experience of life; aroused energy often dominated by sexuality, but not limited to it; experiencing pleasure with awareness and appreciation - enjoying the pleasure instead of the pursuit of pleasure

imbalance: habit forming indiscriminate pleasure-seeking (sex, alcohol, cigarettes, chocolate, drugs), hedonism, becoming obsessed with sexuality and magnetism

adaptive response: search for pleasure is never completed by a sense of fulfillment; desire to lose oneself in stimulating sensations; jealous rage and over-attachment; anxiety concerning your attractiveness; feelings of inadequacy in comparison to others

healthy variation: a creative and controlled passion for life; the search for pleasure is balanced with the art of experiencing enjoyment (desire and appreciation); instead of focusing on what you don't have, you take delight in what is available

c.) Solar Plexus (Power)

healthy perspective:the seat of your willpower and the center that gives mobility to your life - the ability to initiate activity, to define boundaries, and defend yourself from an encroaching world; leads to self-mastery (self-control, self-restraint, self-discipline); development of principles, ethics and beliefs for which you are willing to stand; discernment

imbalance: overuse - competition, conflict, battle, ruthless ambition, fear of letting go, need to prove yourself; underuse - feeling guilty when you say "no," inability to assert oneself, lack of self-esteem and self-confidence, acting the "martyr role," guilt and shame drive you from standing up for yourself and you seek redemption by being a "good person" and by doing what is expect of you by others (being of service vs. being a servant) 

adaptive response: one-upsmanship interferes with your life and you immediately become defensive when confronted with any opposing views

healthy variation: assert yourself when the situation requires and have the inner strength to be passive when appropriate; since you are not projecting an imbalance of power, you do not attract power conflicts to you; discriminating use of will; awareness of intentions

d.) Heart (Love)

Integration Point: Paradigm shift from fear-based mentality to belief in abundance; the awakened heart drops down defenses and comes from the place within us that is joyful; you experience love, or at least harmonious connection that transcends differences between you and others; the lower three chakras deal with individual energy, separate and distinct from others. the upper three are the collective aspects of self. the heart integrates the personal and spiritual, ego and spirit; you are able to enjoy the vitality of the lower physical chakras, as well as the bliss and creativity of the upper ones; you find out what you love to do, do it, and share the resultant joy with others; you're able to accept those you meet and genuinely care for them, without getting drawn into their dramas; being able to give without expecting anything in return, being able to receive graciously from others; the heart chakra is the center, the seat of the soul

healthy perspective: ability to glimpse a world beyond survival and competition; you see yourself reflected in everyone you meet; bias towards cooperation, not coersion; there is nothing to defend, and joy comes from an immense acceptance of life and other people; unconditional love is experienced with others

imbalance: 'bleeding heart' - inability to separate one's problems from those of others, leading to doing things for others as the price for being accepted; over-attachment in love and codependency; indiscriminate love; giving in to the demands of others just to avoid conflict; guilt and shame about the suffering of others, as if it were your fault

adaptive response: awakening to suffering and becoming preoccupied or immobilized by it

healthy variation: challenges handled with a touch of grace; your compassion for suffering in the world translates into action; feelings of separateness drop and is replaced by the feeling of being here together with others experiencing this same miracle of life; cultivation of a love for life and creation itself

e.) Throat (Creativity)

healthy perspective: self-acceptance of your uniqueness and originality; find your voice and speak your truth (the authentic voice within); experience of detachment, observation, and synthesis of varying views on life; personal insight merges with the collective mind and creativity is born; looking at life with a fresh perspective of discovery and allowing for innovative thinking; self-expression

imbalance: a feeling of the right for independent thinking, but no discipline with its expression; opposing other's views because you "can," rebelling against consensus reality, defensiveness and rigidity in new beliefs; need to prove your views are right; becoming attached to viewpoints; deception; inability to assert your ideas

adaptive response: becoming a nonconformist as a reaction against others, instead of as an open expression of yourself

healthy variation: a security in your creative identity; having original insights by always looking at life with fresh eyes; always having the ability to express your view and speak your truth; ability to entertain any idea with an open and questioning mind; you help awaken people from their slumberous thinking and catalyze others to awaken to their authentic self

f.) Third Eye (Transcendence/Intiution)

healthy perspective: hunger to experience the magic and meaning of life; drive to experience a transcendent reality beyond the everyday view of life; imagination as the vehicle of transcendence; the world of images, beyond thoughts; the ability to see the Divine in all things; intuition is experienced as a type of knowing beyond strategic thinking; ability to sense if your current path is aligned with your true path or not; ability to transcend polarity

imbalance: imagination disassociating from mundane reality; getting lost in realms of fear, escapism and illusion; inability to discern the impact of your imaginative wanderings on your energy field; confused vision instead of inspiration; guilt and feelings of unworthiness; inability to separate imagination from reality

adaptive response: being "spaced out" and unable to interact with normal reality in a conscientious way; undisciplined imagination - obsessive sexual fantasizing, daydreaming, revenge, escapism; imagining qualities in others they can't possibly live up to, falling in love with qualities that are not there

healthy variation: develop the ability to experience life from the Witness seat - ability to observe yourself with in action, being involved and also aware of the involvement simultaneously; being detached while being involved provides wisdom and insights into the meaning of life; an awareness of a greater reality occurring beyond your individual will; ability to resolve conflict situations by finding the vantage point that sees a larger reality that both polarities are part of

g.) Crown (Spirituality/Unity)

healthy perspective: pure, undifferentiated cosmic energy; desire to experience the Divine; surrender to the entire experience of life as having a purpose - "knowing" - and choosing to accept or deny the responsibility of this knowing

imbalance: living a life anchored in a separate reality, real to you, but not integrated with the world around you

adaptive response: inability to interact with the everyday world in an effective way; being haunted by the embodiments of your fears

healthy variation: absolute surrender to the highest voice you believe in (not sacrifice. sacrifice implies letting go of something you value. in surrender to something higher, you trust all you value will come into alignment as well.); living life that is absolutely in everyone's best interest, including the self; a level of consciousness that is the full awareness that All is One; liberation and true freedom - beyond fear, freedom from limiting and restricting views of reality; linear sense of time dissolves into an awareness of circular time; patience blossoms; all of life is a spiritual path - Life is great!!

Stop Stealing Dreams :: Launching a new idea in a post-paper world

Today a new manifesto Stop Stealing Dreams goes ‘on-sale’. On-sale is in air quotes because it’s free, but we don’t have a word for the on-free date.

http://www.squidoo.com/stop-stealing-dreams Outside of the question of corruption in the News Corps scandal, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/world/europe/murdoch-hacking-inquiry-expands-to-uk-officials.html?hp I was thinking about the question of why these newspapers couldn't hire more journalists with these kinds of sums, and whether investigative journalism they felt would just produce less sensational stories, or whether they had just lost their knack for it. I'm reminded of how epoch IF Stone was (http://www.ifstone.org/) in his ability to get stories without corruption. To what degree has this become a lost art? I've heard of lots of investigative journalists having been let go over the years, and that blogs employ a small fraction of them and that some are gone for good. But is there also a question of how ambitious they are? Is investigative journalism on the rise or fall in terms of scope of their ambitions? Human Protocol Proposal: <<Attribution Check>>

I've been inspired by the Core Protocols for Shared Vision (http://liveingreatness.com/the-core-protocols.html), developed by Jim Mccarthy & Michele McCarthy, and want to propose an Attribution Check protocol as something we can use.

There are many similar ideas all floating in the noosphere right now, and many people attempting to describe them with clarity so they can be summoned into existence more rapidly. 

It has been called to my attention that it may appear to some who do not know me that I am trying to steal ideas or claim them as my own when I write about them on my blog. This is certainly not my intention. I try to write about my own learning and discovery process, and to shine attention on the many many people out there who are working towards our human emergence. If I do not credit a source, it is out of forgetfulness or lack of awareness of a precedent, not deceptive intent. (I also acknowledge this is not an acceptable excuse, especially if we are trying to collaborate and co-create more tightly and build trust.)

So, I want to make it clear that I am trying to promote ideas that matter, and not take them as my own. I also want to propose that all the ideas are out there in the collective mind already, and perhaps as we go forward in constructing new knowledge, we start with an assumption that anything put forth is building on the shoulders of giants.

Here is the protocol proposal. <REVISIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT WELCOME>

Attribution Check 
 
Attribution Check supports your ability to act as an effective, continuing conduit for information, by helping you to retain awareness of information sources and to provide helpful attribution for others. Use Attribution Check to determine whether you or others have credited the source/s of the information presented. Use it when you intend to publish, collaborate, cooperate, or co-create with others.
 
Steps
 
To use on yourself:
 
1.      Ask "What is the source of this information?"

2.      Ask "Have I clearly stated the source of the information, if originated outside of self?"

3.      Ask "Have I acknowledged that there may be precedents to the information I'm sharing, of which I may be unaware?"

 
To use for another (who is aware of the protocol):
1.      State “Attribution Check.”

2.      Briefly identify the particular information about which you have interest, or information.

 
 Commitments
 
- Check in with self about origins of information before sharing it. 
- Provide attribution whenever possible when sharing information.
- Do not be defensive when someone questions your sources of information, or invokes Attribution Check with you.
- Do not assume ill will or deception if someone has not attributed sources. 
- Do not be excessively concerned with murky areas of idea origination, unless your goal is academic.
-Be respectful and pleasant if offering Attribution Check to another. Support is the goal, not attack.
- Offer known sources of information if communicator seems unaware of precedents.
 
Notes
 
- If a precedent to the information presented is revealed, or a source of the information presented discovered, that updated knowledge the original communicator should share said information as appropriate with the audience with whom they originally communicated the information.

Meditation is a technique to develop your mind, so when I catch these thoughts in my meditation net, I can investigate them and ponder why am I having these thoughts, and self counsel both during and not during meditation.

Then as I live I can be mindful of my tendencies or my perspective on things, the way I am, and when I act or think in such a way I can use my wisdom to act on it, by not doing it or choosing a different action.

Just like a fever is a good thing (even though you suffer) as it means your body is keeping the homeostasis…it’s fighting the infection, etc…basically a symptom of regaining balance. Similar your thoughts are a good thing (even bad thoughts) as they are a symptom of a hindrance, your thoughts are a messenger telling you to realign

…actually I like that…your thoughts don’t have to be you, they can just be considered as the messenger This is to all the powerful next edge women - be inspired by a personal next edge story.

http://www.meetup.com/edtechmeetup/events/51419552/?a=ea1_evn&rv=ea1 My latest line of thinking;

We need a clarifying and guiding vision of potential future scenarios which have as their premise a positive, uplifting and inspiring prospect for humanity and the planet. I am calling for a collaborative effort to develop a field of endeavor to address this need.

To this end we can develop the notion; 

“Visions of the future as a “strange attractor” for the emerging, evolving human experience.”

Aim for: Synthesis of the positive views, of these visions into a coherent guiding mythology for the up-liftment and inspiration of humans everywhere.

Method: Collation and mapping of references, presentation of distillation of the common threads, discussion and development of the material into a coherent structure which can form the basis of a variety of expressions of the best and highest good being manifested through “all of us”.

What references can Next Edgers contribute to this effort? The essence of forgiveness is cosmic reciprocity: forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us! http://www.triumphofcommons.com "Those who see the world as a battleground revel in what they’ve made impossible for others. Those who see the world as a commons revel in what they have made possible with others. " “Our planet is our house. We must take care of it if we are genuinely concerned about happiness for ourselves, our children, our friends, and other sentient beings who share this great house with us.” - Dalai Lama

(the same thinking behind the origin of the name for World House)

And much other wisdom from Art Mason's favorite Dalai Lama quotes. http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en I don't normally write posts featuring startups, particularly not pharmaceutical startups, but I found these interesting enough to share here.

The Pink Army Cooperative is "a community-driven, member owned Cooperative operating by open source principles." While some may have concerns about their use of synthetic biology technology, it remains interesting to see collaborative models (coops and open-source) extending into the pharmaceutical industry.  

On a similar note, another pharmaceutical start-up (Transparency Life Sciences - http://www.transparencyls.com) is getting a lot of attention as a result of their intention to use crowdsourcing methods "develop medicines for significant unmet medical needs by acquiring promising drug compounds, designing studies [...] and conducting those clinical studies".

I strongly believe that networking & co-laborating are very effectives tools. Cheers! Talking about scaling... An older report from the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, which confirms that 'agroecology, if sufficiently supported, can double food production in entire regions within 10 years while mitigating climate change and alleviating rural poverty.'

The summary of the report mentions that the main challenge is one of scaling, and suggests appropriate public policies. How can this scale 'sustainably'? Great. I went on Scribd to change the settings on all my documents because I found people selling my documents online, a direct infringement of my intellectual property rights. So I went on Scribd and changed the settings for all the documents so people can no longer download them. Then I changed the settings for every document to "Traditional Copyright - All Rights Reserved". 10 seconds later, Scribd sent me notifications in my email saying my files were deleted because "our text matching system determined that it was very similar to a work that has been marked as copyrighted and not permitted on Scribd." They also threatened to delete my account: "As stated in our terms of use, repeated incidents of copyright infringement will result in the deletion of your Scribd.com account and prohibit you from uploading material to Scribd.com in the future." They gave me an email account I can write to because "Like all automated matching systems, our system is not perfect and occasionally makes mistakes." Accusing me of infringing on my own copyright is no just a "mistake"; I take it as a serious offense and would like to be compensated for the psychological damage that it caused. That's just Scribd, and that's just the beginning.. Soon ACTA et al will send me to Guantanamo for infringing on myself. Can't wait! #scribd #epic #fail :( "A GLOBAL SOCIAL CONTRACT" -- How else can we produce a pro-Nature, pro-Humanity, pro-Planet economy? http://www.facebook.com/pages/EARTH-FEDERATION-MOVEMENT/217713058292206 Here is another older report from the WEF (April 2011) addressing the consumption dilemma and the issues of speed and scale: "Many barriers retard economic transformation or prevent it: perverse incentives, poor policies and pricing of natural resources without reference to externalized costs. Removing these barriers would help – providing immediate competitive advantages to those engaging in sustainable practices. But there are more positive leverage points that can help tip the whole system towards sustainable consumption. In the view of the World Economic Forum Partners, identifying these leverage points – interventions where small changes can produce broad, system-wide results – is the only answer to the scale of the challenge, its systemic character and the speed needed to address it." This is a fantastic animation about the coming energy crisis the world is desperately trying to ignore. It is hard to deny the pessimistic conclusion of the title - or is it?

Singapore -- a country that looks good economically -- ranked last out of the 150 countries sampled. Despite recording a surplus of 28 per cent of GDP in 2007, "its ecological deficits are the worst in the world," says Sumaila.
Spurred by the desire for higher short-term consumption, low and middle-income countries are following the lead of high-income nations, liquidating their ecological and economic capital.

Hi Next Edgers - I'm just going to open with saying that I'm very much greatful of people like Bert-Ola, David Hood, David Hodgson, Rachel Botsman et al. What I'm very embarrassed of at the moment, is global politics. It's a mess. And recent activities in Australia is no exception to this. 

So, much like The Greens Global movement - why don't we create an international political movement ourselves? Respecting business's ability to deliver social innovations, but the need for disruptive enterprise too.

The Trap of Seeking What are our 5 major concerns? Price of Oil; Iran; China-India slowdown; Continued reliance on monetary policy; Growth assumptions. And you? Love? Our task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within ourselves that we have built against it! - Rumi a fun piece from Jamais Cascio 
"So here are our three scenarios:

1) We manage to get a real global agreement in place within the next five-eight years, and spend the subsequent 25 or so years undertaking the largest industrial transformation imaginable. Politically implausible.

2) We don't get a real global agreement in place before 2025, and have to cut emissions by 10% per year (as Roberts notes, the biggest drop we've seen is 5% after the USSR's economy collapsed). Physically implausible.

3) Neither of those happen, and we start to see truly awful impacts, mostly in the developing world at first, all of which make the world politically more hostile and economically more fragile -- and make it more difficult to cut carbon emissions effectively.

This is why I think geoengineering is going to happen. Desperate people do desperate things, and when you hear sober scientists say things like population "carrying capacity estimates [are] below 1 billion people" in a world of 4 degree warming, it's hard to argue convincingly that the uncertainty and risks around geoengineering are worse.

Anyone who thinks that geoengineering is a way to avoid cutting carbon is an idiot. Geoengineering is a tourniquet, a desperate measure to stop the bleeding when nothing else can work in time. If Anderson's analysis is accurate (and, if anything, it may be optimistic), it's hard to see how we can avoid taking these desperate measures." Anyone care to audition for the chance to speak at TED2013? :)

http://conferences.ted.com/TED2013/auditions/ Attached is an article on Actor-Network Theory that serves as a great foundational text on the theoretical perspective of seeing Actors as always already embedded in Networks, and attempts to "verb the noun" of network order(ing). Key points are how heterogenous networks come to be patterned to generate effective organizations and distributions of power, that "agency" can be embedded in objects that have agentive effects on organizations and individuals (eg; immigration documents); the process of translation in constituting the precarious process of social ordering; and the necessarily relational, incomplete, decentralized and distributed nature of power/agency. The article promotes ethnography and following the trail of artifacts and objects as two core methods for exploring the processes by which networks become solidified and resonant (though only truly revealed in their disintegration). My core question thus becomes, how do we conceptualize agency in *emerging* rather than disintegrating structures of macrosociality? As someone who badly needs to improve, I periodically wonder about this. Haven't found a great answer yet. Ideas?

Edward "Millennium consumption goals (MCG) could help make our development path more sustainable, by focusing on the 1.4 billion people in the richest 20 percentile of the world’s population. They consume over 80% of global output, or 60 times more than the poorest 20 percentile. Instead of viewing the rich as a problem, they should be persuaded to contribute to the solution. The MCG will complement the Millennium development goals (MDG) designed to help the world’s poor. The MCG need not be mandatory targets, but rather a set of benchmarks to be achieved by a combination of voluntary actions by sustainable consumers and producers, supported by enabling government policies.
Household consumption drives modern economies, but unsustainable consumption, production and resource exploitation have led to multiple crises that threaten the future survival of humanity. Climate change is now considered the ultimate threat multiplier which will exacerbate the formidable problems of development we already face – like poverty, hunger, illness, water and energy scarcities, and conflict."

WE are just now begining to understand plastics and endochrine disruptors..now that we are dependent on plastics...  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/02/120216185408.htm For those of you working on next edge organizational forms that leverage new, democratizing technology and social processes, you should read this interview with Spanish cyberpunk David De Ugarte who has formed a multinational worker cooperative with many unique features: http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-future-now-an-interview-with-david-de-ugarte Invitation: Ideation Meeting & Bio-Beers!　Thursday, March 1st from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.

Abundance happens when people become Opportunity Makers with/for others. In a world where it is ever easier to find apt allies to seize an opportunity or solve a problem, and the cost is rapidly falling for the tools you need, the time has never been better to become an Opportunity Maker who 1. Pulls in apt allies, who 2. Share a strong, specific sweet spot of mutual benefit in working on that opportunity together, with 3. agreed-upon Rules of Engagement.
For further proof of the power of being what I dub Opportunity Makers, read Abundance by X prize founder Peter Diamantis and science writer Steve Kotler. “Innovative small teams are now empowered to accomplish what only governments and large corporations could once achieve,” suggests Tim Ferris. As Steward Brand wrote, “Every breakthrough helps empower others, and so they aggregate into a trend you can count on.”  Start now, adopting Phil Keoghan’s credo: “No opportunity wasted.”

This article also reminded me that my suspicion always is that people who think the world is doomed (and conversely who think they have the only answer to a perfect world) whether their instincts are left or right, up or down, forward or backwards often have as their real agenda the desire to control others. I think this is a great unsolved mystery of life: how do we help create an environment where things become better without falling to the demon of wanting to control others.

http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/01/taleb_on_antifr.html "Not all at once but rather slowly, in fits and starts, a new societal condition is emerging: network culture. As digital computing matures and meshes with increasingly mobile networking technology, society is also changing, undergoing a cultural shift. Just as modernism and postmodernism served as crucial heuristic devices in their day, studying network culture as a historical phenomenon allows us to better understand broader sociocultural trends and structures, to give duration and temporality to our own, ahistorical time. 

If more subtle than the much-talked about economic collapse of fall 2008, this shift in society is real and far more radical, underscoring even the logic of that collapse. During the space of a decade, the network has become the dominant cultural logic. Our economy, public sphere, culture, even our subjectivity are mutating rapidly and show little evidence of slowing down the pace of their evolution.

"In the current GOP Presidential “horse race”, we see the exact same pattern. Wealthy connoisseurs of political talent pick a candidate. These wealthy connoisseurs then keep that candidate racing until they lose interest.

Foster Friess, a billionaire mutual fund executive, hasn’t yet lost interest {1} in Rick Santorum. Friess has personally bankrolled the “super PAC” that has enabled Santorum to stay in the primary hunt.

Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, the billionaire casino mogul couple, haven’t yet {2} lost interest in Newt Gingrich. The Adelson family has single-handedly supplied $10.5 of the $12 million that has gone into the super PAC that’s keeping Gingrich in the nominating race.

Super PACs are now playing a larger role in politics than the candidates’ own personal campaigns.

Mitt Romney, meanwhile, is leading that race, but only because he has more billionaires on his side than anyone else. Four of these billionaires from the hedge fund industry – Paul Singer, Julian Robertson, Robert Mercer, and John Paulson – have each contributed $1 million to the cause of Mitt.

In all, the super PAC run by Romney cronies has collected $1 million from [each of] ten men of immense means, $2 million from one other, and at least $100,000 each from almost forty additional politically inclined super rich, more than enough to fund {2} the $17 million TV ad campaign that bounced Romney into the nomination lead." found via Donna Morton A simple technique for making it more likely one arrives at future goals: Visualize the end result clearly & in some detail.

The Global Square Project, which is Occupy's answer to Facebook, is making a call for developers as they ramp up the project...

Greetings, volunteers!

The new release of TheGlobalSquare project published in February 14th defined some directions taken by the coordinators in contact with volunteers and other interested projects contacted. A must read!

A parnership with TU Delft brought us the possibility to build the first desktop application for a decentralized and attack resilient social network projected for civic interaction and co-working. It will be developed using Tribler's 'kernel' Dispersy. This deployment is being coordinated by Johan Pouwelse, development coordinator.

Contacts with other groups such as Lorea, Diaspora and FGA - and now with the World Free Media Forum as well - brought the possibility to work on a global RDF vocabulary in order to build a data federation among the different current - and future - projects in the same conceptual field of TheGlobalSquare. This federation is being coordinated by Ed Knutson, development coordinator.

Our http://wiki.theglobalsquare.org is growing, users start to work and develop ideas together in a genuine and empowered wiki fashion! In matters of press coverage, our project was aimed in the following works and more are to be published. Heather Marsh, conceptual coordinator and spokesperson is managing inquiries and building the wiki.

April arrives and TheGlobalSquare was invited to take part in Berlin Biennale as a major experiment of occupy movement in the field of cybernetics, as a global hackaton is planed to be held as well as other announcements. It is proposed to be an open space for people to practice the concepts of our project, the spirit of occupations, not only destined to coding. Carolina Garcia, general coordinator, is taking care of this subject in order to provide the necessary connections so this event will be able to provide participants with a decentralized and plural micro-social-environment to reinvent the world; people from different squares, projects, groups and assemblies will be able to take part in the adventure!

NEW VOLUNTEERS WHO JOINED THE LIST THIS WEEK: PRESENT YOURSELF SO YOU CAN BE CONTACTED BY COORDINATORS! WE WILL CLEAN-UP SOON!

Best, Pedro Noel - general coordinator.

I am self-publishing a book that I hope some of you will be interested in: Life Changing: A Philosophical Guide.

I am interested in the dos and don'ts of self-publishing. How about a good company/service to work with? Anything is appreciated!

I am teaching a short course on Philosophy for Change in Sydney in Feb. http://cce.usyd.edu.au/class/PFCH-4 If you are in town...

Here is a short description of the book. 

Life Changing is a hands on guide to coping and flourishing through change. Drawing on the wisdom of the great philosophers, it shows you how to take the opportunity from change and turn times of change into an adventure. animated in food. Do you know of any group/individual  who would like to arrange a weekend experiencing/learning to make circle work more part of what they do? We are putting together a package we hope will boost cohesion, decision making, general atmosphere etc. As this is the trial stage we will waive our fee but travel, a floor to sleep on and some food would be appreciated. "Where everything started for me was maternal care. It’s advantageous for female mammals to be sensitive to the mood states of their offspring, so they react when their offspring are distressed or in danger."

"There’s nothing wrong with saying that empathy evolved for reasons to serve yourself, or that cooperation evolved in the end to serve yourself. But that needs to be distinguished from what we call the proximate reasons for behavior, or the proximate motivations for behavior. They concern psychology—what makes you do something."

"You’ve talked yourself into a corner if you are an atheist—as Huxley was and as Dawkins is—and you think evolution cannot produce morality. Then it’s a real dilemma—where does it come from? If it does not come from biology, and you don’t believe in religion, you’re going to have a very hard time explaining why humans are moral." "Plenty of reasons have been advanced for this astonishing reversal, but there are times when the obvious explanation is also the correct one, and this is among them. The point can be made even more clearly by noting a detail I’ve brought up here before—the curious fact that the 5% of humanity that live in the United States of America, until quite recently, used around a quarter of the world’s energy and around a third of its raw materials and industrial product. This remarkably disproportionate share of the world’s wealth didn’t come to us because the rest of the world didn’t want such things, or because the United States manufactured some good or provided some service so desirable to the rest of the world that other nations vied with each other to buy it from us. Quite the contrary; we produced very little in America during much of our empire’s most prosperous period, and the rest of the world’s population is by and large just as interested in energy, raw materials, and industrial product as we are.

It’s considered distinctly impolite to suggest that the real reason behind the disparity is related to the fact that the United States has over 500 military bases on other nations’ territory, and spends on its armed forces every year roughly the same amount as the military budgets of every other nation on Earth put together. Here again, though, the obvious explanation is the correct one. Between 1945 and 2008, the United States was the world’s dominant imperial power, filling the same role in the global political system that Britain filled during its own age of empire, and while that imperial arrangement had plenty of benefits, by and large, they flowed in one direction only.

With this in mind, we can move to a meaningful definition of empire. An empire is an arrangement among nations, backed and usually imposed by military force, that extracts wealth from a periphery of subject nations and concentrates it in the imperial core. Put more simply, an empire is a wealth pump, a device to enrich one nation at the expense of others. The mechanism of the pump varies from empire to empire and from age to age; the straightforward exaction of tribute that did the job for ancient Egypt, and had another vogue in the time of imperial Spain, has been replaced in most of the more recent empires by somewhat less blatant though equally effective systems of unbalanced exchange. While the mechanism varies, though, the underlying principle does not." CALL FOR PAPERS: Social Innovation. Social Enterprise. Social Change.

It turns out that we can almost never be sure that someone might not be in a position to return the favor in the future, and we do not want to miss out on that possibility.

The ATCA Research and Analysis Wing (A-RAW) and the mi2g Intelligence Unit (mIU) have been working on this ATCA 5000 briefing, “If Greece Defaults, Is The Cascading Shock Worse Than The Lehman Bankruptcy?  Systemic Risk Implications?” 

We would welcome your input in regard to draft 35 prior to official release.

Thank you

DKM

If Greece Defaults, Is The Cascading Shock Worse Than The Lehman Bankruptcy?  Systemic Risk Implications? Draft 35

1.  Is the imminent Greece default just the tip of the iceberg?

2.  Is there a lot more at stake in a potential Greek default than meets the eye at first glance?

3.  Is the much bigger concern what happens in the Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets?

4.  Greek sovereign debt Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are insurance policies, individually written, that basically say:  if Greece defaults, the CDS contract will compensate for what the sovereign should have.  Credit default swaps have grown exponentially over the last decade.  

5.  No one knows: 

            i.  How big is the volume of CDS contracts?  How much CDS exposure is there on Greek debt?  It could be in multiples of actual Greek sovereign debt.  Since the CDS contracts are individually written, there is no clear visible record of how many CDS contracts are outstanding.    

            ii.  Who are the counterparties? The two parties obviously know who the counter-party is but there is no public record that would allow a regulator or a third party to find out who was involved.  This causes a loss of trust during a financial shock and it is this precise problem that caused AIG to almost collapse in the wake of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008.

            iii.  Worst of all, whether the CDS contracts will actually trigger in what many would consider a default?  News circulates that holders of CDS on Greek government bonds wouldn’t receive payouts in the event Greece defaulted.  That decision raises questions about the value of such insurance-like contracts and exposes limitations of the so-called hedging strategies that banks and investors have relied on in the past.

6.  If the swaps don’t pay out when bonds default, what’s the point of even hedging in the first place?

7.  Without reliance on hedging, how will less credit-worthy players raise capital in the world markets?

8.  Does this portend the end of modern capitalism as we know it:  either triggered by a collapse of the CDS derivatives pyramid or total lack of reliance on CDS going forwards thereby shutting access to capital for less than 100% creditworthy players?

http://challenge.bfi.org/solutions/all/0/2012 What are the signs of wisdom and higher consciousness? What leads to greater awareness? EMERGENT LOVING: on this most-commercial day of supposed affections, I ask you, the next edge, to look at your own hearts. While most of us feel extraordinarily comfortable on the edge of innovation in our chosen field(s), and are even open to such futures as H+/human-machine overlap, many of us are also still residing in a fearful place regarding our interaction with eachother in our Loving, in our romantic, sexual, and family relationships.

As a gift to yourself and the full forward marching of this community of possibility, I ask that you consider the ways in which fear and/or a human-diminishing status quo still dominates your relationship with LOVE... and as a result with everyone and everything -- both via these relationships and any that you are still to have.  

How does your fear/love threshold still contain remnant, less evolved parts of your psyche, and importantly, how and when does this or can this threaten your/our movement towards growth? So many times I have heard stories about interpersonal affairs negatively affecting our movement forward through the deeply embedded emotional lacunae lurking in our hearts/romantic centers -- to the extent that it can confuse and stymie our real evolution together.

To that end, I would like to put forth that we all love each other deeply, and in fact, are "in love" with each other, in so far as our emotional, energetic, and spiritual resonance is so in tune, in a way we have never experienced in our lives. If you are inexperienced in working with energy bodies, you may be feeling body-surges that can feel almost sexual in ways you have never before experienced. Do not misconstrue these as being "romantic" connections. You will have them with men and with women, be open to them and not confuse them with the sorts of emotions understood in or definable via common contemporary parlance. 

IN LOVE WITH YOU,

Like the rising temperature of the water the proverbial frog is sitting in, organizations are feeling the social era all around them, but failing to notice how significant a change it has produced. Because it has shown up in bits and pieces, via freemium models, crowdsourcing, online communities, virtual workforces, social networks, and so on, it is easy to miss how much the overall context has changed for the way value is created.

You might notice that I have used the term social era. It's not to create more jargon, it's to emphasize a point: that social is more than the stuff the marketing team deals with. It's something that allows organizations to do things entirely differently — if we let it become the backbone of our business models." My love is not limited to a single Other, but to All - and We are building a world far more kind, resilient and encompassing than the one from which we've sprung. To the Future, with Love ~♥~

"The next Buddha will not take the form of an individual. The next Buddha may take the form of a community; a community practising understanding and loving kindness, a community practising mindful living. This may be the most important thing we can do for the survival of the Earth."
—Thich Nhat Hanh For a bit of specificity concerning how the design of our artifacts are setting our evolutionary trajectory - and the value of humility:

"Class-two evolutionary trendings are all those events that seem to be resultant upon human initiative-taking or political reforms that adjust to the changes wrought by the progressive introduction of environment- altering artifacts. All the class-two evolutionary events tend to flatter human ego and persuade humanity to deceive itself by taking credit for favorable changes in circumstances while blaming other humans or `acts of God' for unfavorable changes. It therefore assumes that humanity is running the Universe wherefore, if its power-structure leaders decide that is is valid to cash in all of nature's available riches to further enrich the present rich or to protect them militarily from attacks by their assumed enemies - all at the cost of terminating human presence on planet Earth - that is the power-structure leader's divine privilege.

All the class-one evolutionary trending is utterly transcendental to any human vision, planning, manipulation, and corruption. Class-one evolution accounts for humans' presence on Earth. It accounts for their having always been born naked, helpless for months, and inexperienced - ergo, ignorant, hungry, thirsty, curious, and therefore fated to learn how to survive only through trial-and-error-won, progressive accumulation of experience. Class-one evolution accounted for humanity's all-unexpected invention of verbal (aural, sound) communication, and thereby the integration of the experience-won information of the many, whereby the integrated information of the many increased the capability of humanity at large to cope with the exigencies of life. It is class-one evolution that led, after the progressive integration of the total experience-won information, to the unpredicted invention of writing or visual communication, by means of which the dead could speak to the living and within which total written information history human mind from time to time discovered repetitive patterns, which in turn sometimes led to the discovery of generalized scientific principles.''

Here's a recent self-intro from his brand new blog: 

"What interests me is the state of our world. So you can expect to see things on energy, on the economy, on politics, on transportation, and on social trends. I do think we are standing at or very near the precipice: much of what we’ve institutionalised as “the way things are” is about to break. I believe that twenty years from now we will be living very local lives, and so small neighbourhoods and communities will matter far more than they do today. How we’ll live in that world is always in the forefront of my reading.

Yet — despite the “gloomy” cast that looking at the precipice can bring — I’m not a pessimist. True, I’m not a techno-optimist: I think we’re out of time for most of that, and I can do just enough of the math to realise that the world is running out of easy ways to do many of the things technology depends on. But it’s not the end, either: the future will simply be different."

"Randall Wray defines a Job Guarantee this way: “A job guarantee program is one in which government promises to make a job available to any qualifying individual who is ready and willing to work. Qualifications required of participants could include age range (i.e. teens), gender, family status (i.e. heads of households), family income (i.e. below poverty line), educational attainment (i.e. high school dropouts), residency (i.e. rural), and so on. The most general program would provide a universal job guarantee, sometimes also called an employer of last resort (ELR) program in which government promises to provide a job to anyone legally entitled to work.” I feel that with 8% (nominal) unemployment stretching as far as the eye can see, a humane society needs to be looking for alternatives to the current regimen."

I choose this song by this musician of the Egyptian Arab Spring to share with you my new "tribe" mostly because of the crowd dynamics captured in this clip! You will see hands raised in this clip when Rami asks who was there in Tahrir Sq on April 8th! Frequently during that intimate evening among other young creative Egyptian activists, Rami introduced young poets who wrote his songs.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyEdyghLbjs&context=C3bd346bADOEgsToPDskI7HYNtCtm0P8V_wsdeBKwL Can anyone tell me if facebook provides a way to control whether or not we get added to groups? My daughter is experiencing random adds to groups with disturbing content - is there a setting for this hidden somewhere? Who here is prepared to jump into solving issues in the Commons of this caliber? How do we bring the perspectives, expertise, and influence required to enact a multi-dimensional win for those involved? 

“"While newspapers and television... talk about the lives of celebrities, the chief of the Kayapo tribe received the worst news of his life: Dilma, "The new president of Brazil, has given approval to build a huge hydroelectric plant (the third largest in the world). It is the death sentence for all the people near the river because the dam will flood 400,000 hectares of forest. More than 40,000 Indians will have to find another place to live. The natural habitat destruction, deforestation and the disappearance of many species is a fact."
What moves me in my very bowels , making me ashamed of being part of Western culture, is the reaction of the chief of the Kayapo community when he learned of the decision—his gesture of dignity and helplessness before the advance of capitalist progress, modern predatory civilization that does not respect the differences . . .

But we know that a picture is worth a thousand words, showing the reality of the true price of our bourgeois "quality of life". image and text By: Karl Newbury””

Impacts like these that call for compassionate swift and effective, generative action.

SHORT-TERM: The above is a win-lose scenario that likely calculates ‘economic value’ by thin metrics. The rough equation is 40,000 livelihoods + shamanic eco-system + hi-primary productivity nature = X gigawatthours of electricity a year. This ‘solution’ involves potentially non-retrievable losses in the Physical & Knowledge Commons. 
-Who here knows how to express the above win-lose and map a win-win as profit/loss statements for society? Calculate alternatives for energy generation in a similar way, investment, risk, return…

LONGER-TERM: 
As @Tom Atlee said so eloquently: 

“What combination of wise decision-making process and participatory empowerment would make such short-sighted, life-degrading decisions impossible? How could such dynamics become as thoroughly institutionalized in new cultures as money-thinking has become in ours… Our failure to take seriously the downsides of our progress, decisions, technologies, consumption, etc., are building a feedback deficit that will soon catch up to us. It isn't about the spotted owl, it is about the collapsing habitat/natural systems we are part of. As more of what supports our business as usual is shredded, we will feel the backlash of the rubber band we have been stretching for the last few hundred years.... We are all Kayapo...” -Tom Atlee After having a great chat with John Furey yesterday (thanks John) about some of the dynamics here - I would like to remind everyone who has not to take a few minute to take the MindMaps assessment. Their work is very fascinating and having a group map of this sort could be very helpful in creating flow, alignment and moving through conflict should it arise.

Here's one effort to help make that happen, based on the work of Buckminster Fuller...

http://designsciencelab.com/enews/DSLab_2011.html Flemming Funch's post below reminds me that I had not shared this TEDx talk with this group.  Flemming, our past decade of work - and the work of those we have trained - confirms exactly what you are saying! (Watch to the end, to see the flow in action). BIG question.

In the old phrase:  We keep tripping over the dollars to pick up the pennies.  We are all appreciate the value of social networks and how they can have a transformative impact on social/economic systems for the better.  Yet we are sitting here passively watching our critical infrastructure get scooped up.  For example:  Path.com  This is one of the core ideas of those of us working on blogging back in the early days made real via a cell phone app.  Life blogging.  The entire thing is being handed over to a company with the ethical level of a peanut (like Facebook/Twitter/etc.).  Yet, despite the problems, the company is zooming.

This tech isn't that hard to build.  Really. It's not hard to form companies or coops that shares the benefits with the participants and moves the community forward.  So, why aren't we doing this?  What is the secret sauce behind any successful social application?   10,000 high volume network connectors that seed it, use it and drive it to popular adoption.  That's well within our grasp as a group.  

So why aren't we doing it?

See:  http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/02/path-dave-morin-explains-data/ The problem with technology. long but good. http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2011/09/hoadley Did you know that you are probably a world changer? You may not think about it much it but in many of our choices we actively contributing to the cultural innovation which is shaping the future. What's my reasoning? Because many of our initiatives and projects embody new values, new ways of working and being in the world. 

Think about it for a minute: Do any of your choices in your relationships or lifestyle seem odd when compared to the mainstream? Have you ever had a hard time describing what you do when asked? How about your attitude towards politics? 

Regardless of what is going on in mainstream politics, I think policy should be about enabling the world we're building, not trying to make us fit into models that are out of touch and out of tune. Edgeryders is trying to make a small contribution towards this by highlighting initiatives that are at the forefront of this change. We do this in order to acknowledge the contributions the protagonists are making in opening new avenues for others and for society at large. And to better understand what role European Institutions can play in making that journey a little less rough next time around, both for us and for the ones that follow. 

Here is how you can help: Please tell us about the amazing things you and your friends are doing, or have experienced, so that we can showcase the cultural innovation which is shaping a new way of making our way in the world. We are interested in new kinds of employment, social enterprises and other projects which embody new values, cultural centres, galleries, projects and teams. If it's a place that people can visit, so much the better - take a tour in your own city or while you are travelling, and see some of the New Planet. The future is already here, we just need the stories that make it feel real and render change inevitable :) new guest post by Next Edger Frank W. Spencer IV on futures thinking frameworks. thanks frank! An invitation to come and read No Straight Lines: making sense of our non-linear world as an open access participatory book.

It looks at how we can build better more sustainable societies, organisations and vibrant economies through innovative practice. It argues we need to design and create for the needs of humanity not industrial systems.

http://www.no-straight-lines.com An interesting talk and estimation of five major areas of change to impact our lives in the next years. 

Those changes, if all or some of them do come about in the near term, will have profound impact on the availability of jobs. Perhaps that should induce us to think how all those people without jobs can now survive and keep their families alive... 

Do we need an alternative to the current "no job - no money" type system? I was thinking about the discussions over the weekend, and realized I had written down some of my thoughts on this almost two years ago. So here is a link to that blog post.

Why poorly designed metrics are worse than none at all: I went to Jinni.com to check out their "movie genome project" - I typed in 'profound' as a search term. It clearly thesaurus-ed 'profound' into 'deep' and returned as search results plenty of movies with "deep" in the title, including "The Deep End of the Ocean" "The Deep End" (different movie) "Deep in the Valley" "Deep Red: The Hatchet Murders" as well as violent flicks ("Rabid" "Jack the Ripper"...). Listening to Daniel Pink's interview of Gary Hamel (awesome) strikes me that discussion of what model we need to create to replace the Organizational Control model is the wrong conversation.

For this group I'd introduce myself this way... Since the mid-90s I've taken 11 years of digital media experience at leading consulting, communications, and design studios and in the past 5 years applied these digital media skills to the civic sector for education tech and currently for participatory bottom-up urban planning. 

Now in my 16th year of professional media practice the next edge for me means making interfaces (of any kind) more human-centered, yoking technology to a Media Ecology awareness, rather than unmindfully being yoked by technology.

Via Carmen Medina (@milouness), who would be in here if only I could find her on Facebook. The 21st century doesn’t need more leaders – nor more leadership. Only Builders can kickstart the chain reaction of a better, more authentic kind of prosperity.

A very important point made by Umair Haque in “The Builders Manifesto“:

Excerpt:

“Leaders don’t create great organizations — the organization creates the leader. 20th century economics created a canonical model of organization — and “leadership” was built to fit it.

Leadership can be a bad. Organizations are just tools — and leaders are just more proficient users.

I met Edgard Gouveia and he is masterful at play and social change. Yes Carmen!! Thanks for the invite, Jim Benson I released a systematic philosophic spoken word thesis about the organization, governance, and potential alternative history of the self. It covers topics like how do we handle illegal immigration into the civilization within ourself without becoming an apartheid state within. It addresses topics like how do we merge cultures within to create an exportable identify reflective of our whole diversity within. It addresses some of the challenges created by overly-unitary models of the self. I consider it a functioning and self-loving operating system of knowledge. Check it out and let me know what yall Next Edgers think. www.intrapersonalcartography.com I'm updating the funding/philanthropy section of my web library and this 1999 article titled "The Social Sector as a Beta Site for Business Innovation" has relevance still today. Would be interesting if someone had a map showing progress on this topic from 1999 to now.  http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2974.html Guess what?

My 14 yr old son got to put his video editing class skills to good use in this one, and I think I like what the Pecha Kucha format offers us as a historical artifact of the #we_b event and the collaborative developments it has continued to catalyze. I'd love to create one without having to present it in person but for video only, and let the story emerge through a different participant voice speaking to a collage they have created for each of the 20 seconds. Can Next Edgers please share examples of post change-making event or collaborative process harvesting techniques/formats that have made a memorable impression on you?

When: 2/15 at 9am

Link: http://bit.ly/wceILd

Panel description:

2011 was a year that saw open sourcing catapult technology forward. Listen to our panel of emerging and prominent social good organizations discuss how they are applying inclusive thinking to the social good space, envisioning new ways to work together and pioneering open models for collaboration. From online networks and collectives to shared resources, see how the landscape of social collaboration is being reinterpreted. A question I'm asking myself a lot lately is this::  "How do I want to be interacted with, to join a new society?"

-- (long post) --

Suppose my ideal society of dreams exists, **already,** though very much still in formative stages.  What's more, not only does it exist -- but it exists nearby.  Just 7 blocks from where I live.

And suppose that -- through various interactions in the broader community -- potlucks, art events, ..., -- I meet the people working on this dream society.

And my question is:  How do I want this interaction to work?  What do I want them to say to me, and what do I want to say to them, and how do I want to hear them respond?  What kinds of things am I looking for, and how do I want to present myself, and how do I want to be presented to?

My ideals are very precious to me, after all.  How do I know that you actually share them?  How do I know that I can trust you?  How do I know that I'm not going to become a cog in your machine?  Suspicions about action and charisma are based in just exactly these questions, after all.  It is *very* personal;  It is the quintessence of personal.

Trust isn't just a loose matter of "lowering my guard," or convincing you to lower your guard.  Trust isn't a game of trickery or technique.  There's no way through but the hard way:  Mutual obedience to a higher middle.  The questions of power, money, reputation, ... all right there, in the center.

So I ask myself, "How do I want to be approached?"  If the dream society comes to me like the orb in Singularity Sky, I am obliterated.  If the dream society comes to me with a dream, and a vision, and a slot for me to fill, and a contract to fill -- I am lost.  If the dream society comes to me with a spitting image of my own values, and claims the ownership of them, or even just offers me "a share" in them -- then the relationship is horribly imbalanced.  It is so horribly imbalanced that even crude accusations of "egotism" and "pettiness" cannot move me to subservience.

Now I remember the beauty of the oath I took at Damanhur.  Like everything at Damanhur, it was refined.  The phrase I remember was: "I see my own face in this effort."  It captures my feeling exactly.  It is a star that guides my thinking.

Questions of rank and position are of high importance.  We should celebrate like brothers lost at sea and then reunited.  And we should argue like only best friends can do.  You and I need to come to a place of ideological clarity, and certainty that we have  each others backs.  When I am rich and famous, I will share everything with you, including the golden goose, because you are just as responsible as I am, the worlds' confusions be damned.  When you are rich and famous, you will share everything with me, including the golden goose itself, because I am just as responsible as you are, the worlds' confusions be damned.

People say that these feelings and trusts cannot scale, but I don't believe it.  I have felt the solidarity rushing the airs at Damanhur, and I feel solidarities waiting trapped patiently at the inner door, whispering the location of the keys.

So how do I want to be approached?

I want to be seen.  I want to be appreciated.  I want the doors of the people to be opened wide to me.  I want to be trusted, and I want to be tested:  I cannot trust you if you do not test me, I cannot trust you if we do not test one another.

Your egotism is fine, if what I find in fact is that there is no deep wealth inequality:  A human being's pride is a fine thing, and my aim is not to break you.  I am much more bothered by appearances of humility, and a reality of subtle put vast power inequality...  So let freak flag can fly high, and show proudly.

Perhaps above all, I want to hear you speak of your ideals.  I would like you to be King Arthur.  Lancelot and Guinevere are fine;  I am polyamorous myself.  But be a King Arthur, and I can never remorse myself for sitting at your noble and perfect round table.

I want to be asked about the spirit of things, and brought in as an important person, even if I tremble, even if I am full of doubts and problems, even if I do not know what I am doing.

These are some of the ways I'll know that the society is near. NextEdger Gregory Rader hinting at revolutionary forms of wealth on the horizon.

This isolated area has remained remarkably intact both biologically and culturally. It is one of the most densely populated rural regions of Africa yet its people have been farming sustainably for 10,000 years. Shot in Ethiopia, New York and Kenya, the film explores the modern world's untenable sense of separation from and superiority over nature and how the interconnected worldview of the Gamo people is fundamental in achieving long-term sustainability, both in the region and beyond. http://torrentfreak.com/download-a-copy-of-the-pirate-bay-its-only-90-mb-120209/

Peter Burgess, some folks in this group might like what you are doing with http://truevaluemetrics.org From the genetically determined to culturally determined

"As the dynamics of life on the planet change, from the genetically determined to the cultural, our decisions have the power to alter life on the planet. The most responsible decision we can make will be one that maintains the conditions of life and makes the earth blossom for millions of more years. 

For now it is our culture that determines the planet - so it is our responsibility to act. If we don't then we condemn all including our children to nemesis" "Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory offers clarity.  Hofstede, the founder of comparative intercultural research, measured the general tendencies of national cultures on the following four dimensions: Power Distance (PDI), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), Individualism versus Collectivism (IDV), and Masculinity versus Femininity (MAS). (Definitions of Hofstede's cultural dimensions are listed at the end of this post.)  His research found that the US is a highly individualistic, masculine, short-term oriented culture.  Put simply, it’s every one for themself, winner take all, can’t see past the end of our noses around here.  From where I stand, it seems things could be better for all of us.  I believe that we could use a little balance on these dimensions, and that having more women in leadership positions would help us strike that balance." Shared by a friend to me...worth sharing.

In other thread I have support offer to help me designing my future eco-house. Where I live building own house is a tradition. The idea is not only to have better conscience for sustainable life, but also to do something different can be a model in my locality.
As I think it is more challenging to reach out the Next Edge in your locality, in your action radius, in the bread and food one eats, the shelter one choose, the water, your face welcoming life and light every day.. I see many great books and papers and theoretical discussion and, The SORROW humans have, the destructive footprint we perform in our societies. I see how it is easy to dream and imagine different reality but how it is difficult to change own life style. I think the support we give each other to be the change is the one has most value.

Back to the house design: I have started talking with my wife about the basic functional elements such as heating; I have introduce her the rocket stove. Most of the designs are cal-earth look. Something I like, but looks strange for our traditions which we do not have in contemporary interior design. 
This example shows that the design have to be acceptable to the average traditional taste and here leys the challenges.

The Urban Food Revolution provides a recipe for community food security based on leading innovations across North America. The author draws on his political and business experience to show that we have all the necessary ingredients to ensure that local, fresh sustainable food is affordable and widely available.

He describes how cities are bringing food production home by:

    * Growing community through neighborhood gardening, cooking and composting programs
    * Rebuilding local food processing, storage and distribution systems
    * Investing in farmers markets and community supported agriculture
    * Reducing obesity through local fresh food initiatives in schools, colleges and universities.
    * Ending inner-city food deserts

Producing food locally makes people healthier, alleviates poverty, creates jobs, and makes cities safer and more beautiful. Yikes. It looks like the Phillipines was hit with a pretty big earthquake:

A crisis management platform and organisation born out of the Kenyan post-election crisis of 2008 that can record critical information of events unfolding on the ground via a blend of location-based data, eyewitness accounts and mobile telephony, from often hard to reach places which visualises those unfolding events so that others can act and direct action at internet speeds. And now utilised for free in many parts of the world. Or, the largest organic diary farm in Britain, that has evolved a methodology that allows it to remain autonomous, profitable and sustainable in a market that is acutely volatile … They are collectively representative of a new reality of living, working and organising." Does anyone in this group have experience with holacracy? Like? http://www.holacracy.org/ "If you pit a good performer against a bad system, the system will win almost every time.
This quote from Rummler & Brache in Improving Performance, sums up many of the symptoms of hierarchical systems, whether they be schools, businesses or even prisons.
The great work to be done at the beginning of this century is the democratization of the workplace. Efficiency and effectiveness are not enough, and too often become mechanistic. It’s time to discard industrial management models that emphasize command and control and ensure that individuals at all levels have opportunities to engage in and question the system."

Clarke is a very compelling writer and I noticed his Flattr button.

Why don't I use Flattr?

I got online late, around '98. From the very beginning I wanted a way to make micropayments. What I had in mind was a little pop window with little coin icons I could drop into somebody's piggy bank. 

I think the action of giving money requires more transparent intention than Flattr allows. A New Underground Movement in Palestine

In 2009 I started a little project, underlying powerful and inspirational talks with homegrown music. I had to stop it due to time and budget constraints (...). But I deeply enjoyed that work. Do people here think it may be of interest to revive it in the context of next-edge, in order to have another channel to spread the meme of the emergent changes? It could become collaborative in the sense that people could contribute samples, clips, own podcasts and talks, or put out a wishlist on suggested speakers, styles, etc. Or maybe other musicians (and other artists?) might want to join? I must say, I do not have any infrastructure anymore, I'd need to buy at least a keyboard, a laptop and an audio interface. Any contribution would be welcome... Sorry if this is inappropriate.

(Online echo chambers: A study of 250 million Facebook users reveals the Web isn’t as polarized as we
). But the key point the article makes is really at the end "For one thing, while it shows that our weak ties give us access to stories that we wouldn’t otherwise have seen, it doesn’t address whether those stories differ ideologically from our own general worldview. If you’re a liberal but you don’t have time to follow political news very closely, then your weak ties may just be showing you lefty blog links that you agree with—even though, under Bakshy’s study, those links would have qualified as novel information. " . But Next Edge, polarization, information apartheid is not one dimensionsional- its trillion-dimensional. So there is a sense in which while learning from more diverse sources in general is good, the kinds of learning that are accelerating are also creating archipelagos of understanding. Why is there so extremely little individual control over what to prioritize or not in their own feed at a macro-level? Ilya Z used to say "never let anything or anyone get between you and those you love". I was explaining the need for Diaspora a while ago to a relative of a different generation to myself by saying that some prejudice is hardwired into the system with intentionality, and other prejudice is structural. All prejudice of information flow has normative implications. Look at it this way. My great-grandfather was a jew in Paris. In 1937 he removed 18 of his teeth and replaced them with gold teeth which he had covered over so that they appeared like normal teeth. He did so after reading the newspapers of his time and talking to people in a non-online social network. The first day of the occupation of Paris his family was taken by the Nazis and he was able to exchange himself for the freedom of his wife and young children (including my grandmother). He was then taken to Auschwitz. He survived the entire war there, occasionally exchanging teeth for food that he and a tiny group of others he gathered needed to survive (more incidentally to the story he also was a taylor and became a black market mustard tradesman at times, but that is not the point here). The point here is that he was able to take action because he wasn't only presented with happy news. When a friend of mine died in July, she had been ill for 9 months. She had posted 100 times before that about her illness, but none showed up in my Facebook feed until th notice of her death (which was either prioritized based on key words related to death or simply and more likely because of all of the condolences comments made on her husband's comment about her death). Almost noone could be so profoundly insensitive as to "like" news of her rapid decline in health. And so the deeply normatively  problematic result that happy news gets spread where the most important news gets hidden. Newspapers were always far from perfect, but at least some human being got to consider what was in folk's interests, and sometimes would ensure they read something they needed to know, like in the 1930s that anti-semitism was on the rise. Now I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for the existence of social networks online and I understand these are early days. But its there are some memes which would benefit human kind if they spread. There are other memes which are impossible to spread if they need to be liked because they are tragic. Who is going to like the unfortunate statistical truth that incidents of domestic violence rise in cities that lose a football game and decline in cities that win for the day of the game? Who is going to like the fact that infanticide of girls in Gujurat at the equivalent of a zip code level is correlated with ethnic cleansing twenty years later (the rich men marry the middle class women, the middle class men marry the poor women, the poor men have noone to marry and kill many, many times more strangers per capita than in regions with lower infanticide rates). Those memes won't spread when they need to spread, and neither will a billion other thoughts of relevance to individual communities because the algorithms are designed to avoid hard truths to get towards happy times where more of what we like flows and we can avoid more often than not more of what we don't like. So I guess I'm not satisfied, not an individual level, not at a social level, and not at a human level. We need control over any system that has profound normative implications and consequences for the way we are able to live our lives. Otherwise our future and our lives have been hacked.  cc'ing some folks who I think would appreciate the hypothesis: Jerry Michalski, David Evan Harris, David Hodgson, Daniel Grippi, Aza Raskin, Alvis Brigis, Mathew Dryhurst. How many of us either did not go to college, entered college early (12-16), dropped out of college, graduated early or had early research/business experience? What happens if we amalgamate educational 'failure' and 'success' that results in early disruption as a common developmental environment?

Is there a common theme we have failed to articulate that early disruption of formal sequential education produces a suite of common adaptations? How old were you when you first went 'off track' and how did you jump the rails?

Over 74 people, all fans of Al-Ahli, were reportedly killed. It was explained to me by an old Egyptian friend, and business colleague, I saw earlier today and who had been active in Tahrir last year, that Al-Ahli football players are known to have been most active in the Tahrir square last year (protecting protestors leveraging their clout). There is a consensus by all I spoke with in Cairo today that this was obviously planned by a party that wants to abort the revolution.

We have received multiple queries from our key clients and partners in regard to the collapse of the oldest private bank – Wegelin (established 1741) -- in Switzerland last week.  Is this a significant canary in the mine shaft in regard to what lies ahead for Swiss banking secrecy and does this asymmetric threat pose a systemic risk for Swiss banks in general?

The ATCA Research and Analysis Wing (A-RAW) and the mi2g Intelligence Unit (mIU) have been working on this ATCA 5000 briefing, “What Really Happened To The Oldest Bank in Switzerland? Wegelin: Death Throes of Swiss Banking Secrecy & Asymmetric Risk to Swiss Banks” 

We would welcome your input in regard to draft 41 prior to official release around the time when the New York markets open.

Thank you

What Really Happened To The Oldest Bank in Switzerland? Wegelin: Death Throes of Swiss Banking Secrecy & Asymmetric Risk to Swiss Banks (Draft 41)

Oldest Swiss Bank Goes Down

Wegelin and Co, the oldest private bank in Switzerland, agreed to a fire sale to Raiffeisen Group in the middle of its death throes last week.  Wegelin bank -- established 270 years ago in 1741 -- managed to survive every threat across three centuries: revolution, financial disaster, and war including being invaded by Napoleon, the Sonderbund civil war and then Hitler.  Every threat except for one:  the relentless assault on Swiss banking secrecy by the United States government to reclaim the funds lost through tax evasion schemes sold to its citizens.  Wegelin is now finished, courtesy of Uncle Sam.  How long before other Swiss private banks follow Wegelin's shocking demise? 

Why Did Wegelin Go Down?

The break-up of Switzerland's oldest private bank Wegelin -- involved in a row with US authorities over tax cheats -- became necessary when clients pulled 4 billion Swiss francs -- $4.35 billion -- of wealth in a very short period.   January’s US indictment, which didn’t identify Wegelin, referred to it as ‘‘Swiss Bank A” and said that three bankers wooed US clients fleeing UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank.  Wegelin said earlier this month that three bankers were charged in New York with conspiring to help US clients hide more than $1.2 billion from American tax authorities. 

Remarkably, Wegelin bank neither had offices nor employees in the United States. They were 100% Swiss, and violated no Swiss law whatsoever.  However, this was not enough to protect them.  US authorities believed that a handful of Wegelin’s US clients were hiding assets and not paying taxes. The fact that the bank wasn’t subject to US law and it had zero legal responsibility in ensuring their customers filed tax forms became irrelevant.  The US government ultimately crushed Wegelin.  How?  By threatening Wegelin bank with lawsuits, investigations, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) penalties and criminal charges levied personally against the bank directors, the US government succeeded in its mission. The scare tactics were enough to chase away the bank’s customers, and Wegelin has now sold what little was left of its non-US business. 

Sale Price and Managing Partner's Statement

Although Wegelin did not make public the sale price of its non-US business, Konrad Hummler, the managing partner of Wegelin, said in a statement:  “The immensely difficult and existence-threatening situation into which the legal conflict with the US authorities brought us forces me and my long-term partner Otto Bruderer, together with all unlimited-liability partners, to take this extremely painful action.”  The purchase price for Wegelin bank's good assets was somewhere between 2.5 and 3 percent of the 21 billion Swiss franc total, putting the price tag somewhere around 500 and 600 million Swiss francs.  Wegelin is still left with US assets under scrutiny from US prosecutors.  Patrick Odier, chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association, said:  “It’s regrettable that the oldest private bank of Switzerland has to be confronted with the only solution to sell itself to preserve the interests of its clients.” 
 
Big Attack on Swiss Financial Sector:  11 Swiss Banks Under Scrutiny

In December 2011 it was revealed that 11 Swiss banks had been given an ultimatum to hand over thousands of client names and pay billions in fines to avoid tax evasion prosecution in the US.  The Swiss banks were under pressure to provide all correspondence with offshore clients over the past 11 years – with deadlines set for the end of December 2011 and the end of January 2012.  Some of the banks in question were very close to caving in and delivering the data directly – until the Swiss government intervened and persuaded them to encrypt the data for the time being.

Washington Tightens the Noose Around Swiss Banks

Former UBS CEO Oswald Gruebel says he fears US authorities are likely only to tighten the noose around the Swiss financial sector.  "The end of the bank Wegelin is only the prelude to a big attack on the Swiss financial sector... a solution to the tax dispute will likely be very expensive for these banks."  UBS avoided US prosecution in 2009 by admitting it aided tax evasion, paying $780 million and handing over confidential data.  The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has been steadily closing a net around Swiss banks ever since the UBS admission of assisting tax evasion by US citizens in 2009. The Swiss authorities were then compelled to water down banking secrecy laws by handing over the names of nearly 4,500 UBS clients.  The DoJ and the US tax authority – the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) – have been building cases against other Swiss banks that are alleged to have either opened secret accounts from scratch or poached UBS clients who wanted to dodge the tax-evasion crackdown such as Wegelin.  Amongst other major Swiss banks under US scrutiny are Credit Suisse and Julius Baer.

Encrypted Data and New Swiss Treaty with Washington

The documents handed over to date to the US tax authorities are encrypted to protect the names of individuals and client advisors. The key to decoding the information will only be provided on assurances from the US government that no further action against Switzerland’s remaining 300 banks will be taken.  Switzerland wants these assurances to be enshrined in a new treaty with Washington.  Mario Tuor at Switzerland’s State Secretariat for International Financial Matters, says the Wegelin "transaction shows how important it is to reach an agreement on the untaxed assets soon... from the Swiss perspective, the sooner we have an agreement, the better.  Both the US and Switzerland want a quick solution, but not at any price.” 

US-Swiss Talks

The Wegelin indictment came amid US-Swiss talks to resolve US probes of offshore tax evasion.  The Bern-based Swiss government has been lobbying for a year to get the investigations dropped in return for the payment of a hefty fine and the transfer of names of tens of thousands of US bank clients.  Switzerland and the US aim to conclude talks on the tax matters by the end of 2012.  The negotiations have stalled because the US, which wants a fine in the billions, is demanding to see more bank client data.

After consultation with Credit Suisse and seven other Swiss banks, Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf has offered the US tax authorities millions of internal client emails.  The number of documents already delivered is estimated to be on a large scale, most of which have been provided by bank giant Credit Suisse.  Credit Suisse decided to turn over US client information rather than face summons.

The move is seen as part of Switzerland’s strategy to try to stem the tide of US attacks on Swiss banks.  

Has Bern Misplayed Its Hand?

Successful deals with the Germans and the British, where cash, not information is handed over, may have lulled the Bern-based Swiss government into a false belief that cordial diplomatic relations would temper the US justice department and US tax authorities' zeal.  Instead, the Americans seem to use each new piece of information to build another case over hidden funds.  The American Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants names of cheats and to determine if banks broke US laws. Prosecutors also have been deft about getting indicted bankers to implicate their former colleagues, employers and clients, for leniency.

Some observers question the wisdom of the Swiss government's lure tactic, pointing to the risk that it might be seen as provocative by the US authorities.  Switzerland may be mistaken to believe that a global solution is in the offing.  The American side is absolutely not interested in such a solution, because it would give them less opportunity to exert pressure by making examples of banks of the Wegelin-type and impose hefty billion dollar fines.  Is the US more likely to come forward to make a deal when the lemon has been squeezed totally dry?

FACTA Legislation

To add to Wegelin-type Swiss banking woes, there is the new American FATCA legislation: Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The law effectively requires every bank in the world to make a choice:

1.  Accept Americans as customers, but agree to share information with the US government;
2.  Close the door to all US citizens and residents forever; or
3.  Thumb one's nose at the law, but risk becoming the next Wegelin & Co.

Needless to say, some banks are opting for #1 and some for #2 in order to avoid unnecessary scrutiny and disclosures.

Conclusion

1.  Wegelin & Co is the first standalone Swiss bank to fire-sell its operations in Switzerland as a result of tax evasion pressure from the US.  The twin-track civil and criminal approach seems to be working for the American authorities.  The Wegelin case suggests the battles are far from over.  The action taken by US justice and tax authorities vis-a-vis Swiss private banks may be a prelude to further action by European and Asian powers to recover their own taxes.   

2.  The American authorities show no sign of letting up and investigations may lead them to cantonal banks with links to the Swiss state. Though the Swiss are trying to preserve some semblance of their financial system, the anti-haven snowball looks set to keep rolling. 

3.  Wegelin's fire sale is likely to be followed by more consolidation in Switzerland's embattled financial services industry as the old, low-cost model of booking secret money comes under relentless assault from major governments around the world following the lead of the US government.

4.  Even the biggest banks cannot serve clients from every country, as wealth management increasingly requires an understanding of the real needs of clients – needs driven not only by the tax laws of their home countries and countries of investment, but by many other factors that are country-specific.

5.  The reality is that the service and pricing model of the past no longer works as Swiss banking secrecy erodes and private wealth management goes increasingly on-shore.

Should one, instead, try to work with what one has got? Venessa Miemis 's poster of The Lotus' 9 key capacities inspired me to take another look at the 91 patterns of effective group process in our new Group Works card deck (more info at groupworksdeck.org), and to remark how aligned they are with these 9 personal capacities. Here's my list, with the patterns aligned to those in The Lotus highlighted in yellow: cc Jordan Greenhall "...co-creation is not something that happens if managers choose to act in a particular way and not if they don’t. It occurs continuously and spontaneously, as a natural dynamic of the socially complex nature of all organizations."

"...co-creation takes place spontaneously. It happens as people perceive, interpret and evaluate things in the natural give-and-take of organizational life; through the conversations that they have with themselves (i.e. thinking) and those that they have with others. Importantly, this doesn't just happen where the formal position is arrived at through participation and involvement. It applies just as surely in a 'command and control' regime."

So if co-creation just exists, then what we want is to amplify it by allowing people to connect

Thoughts? This is the model enabling the very small political contribution and how that can lead to  an important utility... and perhaps offer a practical path to other modes of self-organization for collective action.

This is on the Economist! some nice resources: CHART OF THE DAY: The Mother Of All Head And Shoulders - What do you think? http://ow.ly/8LvET Holy shit! I am ashamed to say I did not know that Monsanto GM corn CONTAINS Monsanto pesticides.  This study links these corn varieties to organ failure.  In a just world, this information should be widely available and consumers should have the information they need to not feed themselves pesticides.

"We present for the first time a comparative analysis of blood and organ system data from trials with rats fed three main commercialized genetically modified (GM) maize (NK 603, MON 810, MON 863), which are present in food and feed in the world. NK 603 has been modified to be tolerant to the broad spectrum herbicide Roundup and thus contains residues of this formulation. MON 810 and MON 863 are engineered to synthesize two different Bt toxins used as insecticides. Approximately 60 different biochemical parameters were classified per organ and measured in serum and urine after 5 and 14 weeks of feeding. GM maize-fed rats were compared first to their respective isogenic or parental non-GM equivalent control groups. This was followed by comparison to six reference groups, which had consumed various other non-GM maize varieties. We applied nonparametric methods, including multiple pairwise comparisons with a False Discovery Rate approach. Principal Component Analysis allowed the investigation of scattering of different factors (sex, weeks of feeding, diet, dose and group). Our analysis clearly reveals for the 3 GMOs new side effects linked with GM maize consumption, which were sex- and often dose-dependent. Effects were mostly associated with the kidney and liver, the dietary detoxifying organs, although different between the 3 GMOs. Other effects were also noticed in the heart, adrenal glands, spleen and haematopoietic system. We conclude that these data highlight signs of hepatorenal toxicity, possibly due to the new pesticides specific to each GM corn. In addition, unintended direct or indirect metabolic consequences of the genetic modification cannot be excluded."

The change in public sentiment from seeing defending free speech as a duty to preventing arguments as a greater good seems related to the rise of Netocratic epistemology Phil points to in other areas.

Malik contends that the consequence of emphasis on censorship, " has been the creation not of a less conflicted world, but of one that is more sectarian, fragmented and tribal."

Economics in Transition:
The “Triple-Bottom Line” of financial, social benefit, and environmental benefits

http://www.p-ced.com/1/projects/ukraine/sumy/iscs2009/ I know this is kind of like a shout out, but Andrea Kuszewski piece about technological disobedience, I thought it was quite powerful. It resonated with a lot of the other things I am working on.

We should emulate similar philosophies and methodologies, both for simplification purposes and also because I think it will enhance implements like research, curation, edge camps, collabtories, and also ease their use.

It's also relates a lot to the core of The Glass Bead Game. Technologies are designed create emergent properties, I think our pursuits should reflect that. I mean language itself is a technological implement and process. I think perhaps, there could a whole group centered on the ideal of technological disobedience. The group, which I will make, is also another technological implement. Just creating it, is going to warp TNE as we know it. 

In essence, technological disobedience's look into the things we take for granted, and lets us transcend our self-imposed limitations. Tools are efficient as the methodoligies and profiencies of those who use them. I think at TNE its going to be a lot harder to ride the edge, without something we can use to keep afloat, or sustain balance. 

I will post more about it, in time. I shall now create the group... and therefore create a TNE emergence... (which should also create an immediate mental effect) or as I like to refer to it. Magic. http://www.kalamu.com/

http://www.chaoticripple.com/2012/global-transition-2012-and-beyond/ Greetings!

We are increasingly concerned about the massive decline in global shipping’s Baltic Dry Index.  Is this a significant canary in the mine shaft in regard to what lies ahead for both world trade and global aggregate economic and financial activity?

The ATCA Research and Analysis Wing (A-RAW) and the mi2g Intelligence Unit (mIU) have been working on this ATCA 5000 briefing, “Is World Trade Falling Like A Lead Balloon Minus Terminal Velocity? Alarming Collapse of Baltic Dry Index.” 

We would welcome your input in regard to draft 32 prior to official release before the Japanese markets open on Monday.

Thank you

DKM

Is World Trade Falling Like A Lead Balloon Minus Terminal Velocity? Alarming Collapse of Baltic Dry Index [Draft 32]

.  Is the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) one of the most significant leading economic indicators to follow when the media is telling us the global economy is looking great one week and then predicting a double dip recession the next?

.  With immediate effect, we are advising chairmen and CEOs of major corporations and financial institutions in 120 countries around the world as well as parliamentarians, central bankers and regulators not to ignore the alarming non-stop fall in the somewhat obscure, yet instructive Baltic Dry Index (BDI) -- also known as Dry Bulk Shipping -- over the last one month in particular and in the last three months in general.  [Reference Analysis: mi2g Intelligence Unit (miU) and the ATCA 5000 Research and Analysis Wing (A-RAW)] 

.  Since the beginning of 2012, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) has fallen very steeply to 726 as of Friday, January 27th, 2012, a level not seen since the depths of The Great Reset which began in late 2008.  By comparison, over the last ten years the Baltic Dry Index has averaged approximately between 2,500-2,750.  BDI is down more than 50% in the last month and down more than 55% in the last three months!  

.  Our super-computing visualisation and analysis of BDI data sets over 20 years suggests that when the Baltic Dry Index falls by more than 25% in a given month, global economic activity is either already decreasing or about to decrease -- regardless of the media chatter by so called economic experts and talking heads on television about increased shipping capacity.  The cause of a massive double digit percentage decline of BDI in one month cannot be attributed to increases in global shipping capacity alone.  Why? Global shipping capacity is simply too large to increase by double digit percentages within one month.  As such, when BDI is falling, it precedes decreased liquidity in equities, falling commodity prices, falling interest rates and falling commodity based currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.

.  A key point to note is that the BDI is a leading indicator of economic activity but not necessarily a leading indicator of consistently rising or falling financial markets -- just more liquid or less liquid markets, due to better or worse economic conditions.  In a less liquid market, falls can be quite large, as sellers wish to sell to virtually non-existent buyers.

.  BDI tracks the cost of shipping major raw material dry bulk cargoes by sea including grain, iron ore, coal and other fossil fuels, cement, copper, sand and gravel, fertilizer and even plastic granules.  Changes in the BDI are often tracked by investors to measure changes in the demand for different commodities around the globe.  Basically, it is an indication of shipping demand against the available worldwide fleet of dry bulk ships. The steelmaking raw material constitutes the largest source of demand for dry-bulk shipping. 

.  BDI is issued daily by the UK-based Baltic Exchange which has been in existence since 1744.  Simply put, BDI tracks the precursors of economic output and, as such, provides a measurement of the volume of global trade at the earliest possible stage.  BDI is one of the very few leading, non-speculative, non-revisable economic measures, unlike GDP growth, unemployment and consumer sentiment measures, all of which are lagging indicators.

. The BDI hit an all-time high of 11,793 on May 20th, 2008, when borrowing money was still relatively easy and excess was the name of the game.  As The Great Unwind became entrenched in the world's economy and The Great Reset caused world trade to collapse in Q4 2008, partially because of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, BDI fell to a low of 663 on December 4th, 2008, ie, a drop of 94 percent, when the BDI hit a 20 year low.  Not surprisingly, the bottom of the ‘Great Recession’ was hit shortly thereafter! 

Conclusion

The Baltic Dry Index’s recent collapse reflects a massive plunge in shipping rates as demand for shipping by sea plummets.  

1. Are we now witnessing a repeat in the slow-down of world trade on a somewhat unprecedented scale last seen in Q4 2008?  
2. Which historical period does the present situation remind you of? 
3. What does the quick succession of monumental events in regard to a potential collapse in world trade portend? 
4. What could be done domestically to mitigate the effects of massive world trade decline if it were to take place?
5. What happens next?

I love combinations - that's the soil of ideas. i just got back from a trip to vermont to visit with Amy Kirschner about building resilient cities. she and Kyra Kristof Pincheira made this very cool "Decision Tree for Vision Manifestion" to map out an inquiry process to help people go from ideas to action. i've been working on transferring that to an infographic. (the tool i'm using doesn't allow for creating straight lines, so forgive the squiggles.)

how does it look? Would love feedback on this idea...

I've been thinking hard about an easy & universal way to explain the project we're developing called Producia and I feel I've finally nailed it.

Imagine if Universities had online/offline malls that had social enterprises as its stores and they were owned & ran by students (co-ops) & only accepted digital currency (mutual credit) instead of scarce US Dollars.

The malls also had Learning Centers where student learn how to turn their passions into a social enterprise business & also provided skill share classes. Is man good or evil by nature? Where does evil come from? Do you believe that "the survival of the fittest" is a valid theory in nowadays society where more goods are available to everyone? What do you think about kids being taught to "be the best" from an early age? How does this affect their development? I know, many questions....I have more :) I'm honoured to have played a part in bringing this into the world.
http://howtosavetheworld.ca/2012/01/27/group-works-card-deck-a-joyful-announcement/ great talk by David Graeber at CIIS on Monday 7 pm

"The anthropologist David Graeber has a strong claim to being the house theorist of Occupy Wall Street. A veteran of the antiglobalization uprisings in Seattle and Genoa, he helped orchestrate the first 'General Assembly' in New York this summer, and has since become one of the movement's most outspoken defenders." Heard a funny one? I'm all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools. Let's start with typewriters! Frank Lloyd Wright Anyone know what's involved in opening a digital library? It would be cool to pool resources for books that could be checked out. Kindle supports one of the systems for this. Quite a dense paper on the corporation as an ailing technology and creating a 'fit for purpose' design for sustainability.

The notion of the corporation as a technology rather than a living system or process is quite interesting. I wonder if someone has access to Sovacool's "Broken by design: The corporation as a failed technology".

Lots on agency as well. Would love to hear your thoughts. While I dive a bit deeper into the paper.

http://www.springerlink.com/content/r46n228075878341/ this question stirred a conversation on my page, so sharing it here as well:

what is in us, in humanity that creates something like Monsanto? What is that needs to be integrated that we can heal it rather than fighting it? What does Monsanto show/point to/in a way gift to us? Edge Camp London now live! http://livestream.com/edgecamp #edgecamp - Can meet in the chat there. At least edglings from some apt timezone. Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, it acknowledges presence of good wherever one shines the light of thankful thoughts! Alan Cohen Some if not most of you probably know that there is an evolution in the computing language that also reflects a shift in paradigm? 
I had an enlightening conversation about it tonight and I am fascinated! 
Apparently sequential programme languaging has now reached its limits, and the future is with the parallel programming language, which kind of reflects the shift from "or" to "and", from "authoritarian" to "participatory" even from "masculine" to more "feminine", I was explained. 
who knew technology can be so fascinating...
our paradigm is shifting right! Is there any overlap between TEDx organisers/TED attendees and here? partly inspired by the conversations happening here...
midnight poetry :) 

evolutionary appetite

I see us as the intelligent, imaginative cells of universe, of Gaia, 
swarming in space with evolutionary appetite 
there is so much activity, so many conversations, 
so many connections happening simultaneously! 
self-organizing, participatory, 
we're finally changing the story! 
we are mending the web, Gaia is mending Her web, 
Life mending Life.

each cell connecting with other cells through 
an intuitive dance of resonance - 
synchronicity and creativity abound 
we are riding a giant wave of consciousness 
heading Home, who else is involved in this plan? 
I am humbled again and again! 
prophecies being activated, star-beings, 
galaxies aligning, Matariki calling. 
The time is NOW.

it is amazing, it makes me dizzy, it makes me weep, 
it makes me scream with joy 
it makes me fall to my knees and say 
Thank you!

what an amazing time to be alive and 
to be an intelligent, imaginative cell of universe, 
to surrender and be a creative life force, 
flowered from the Source. The Next Edge contains the greatest concentration of brilliant minds and especially brilliant design science and systems-oriented minds I have ever seen anywhere. Whole-systems solutions are what will be required to make a big enough difference for the planet's major problems to avert disaster.

The world needs a redesign and a crash-course in change to implement the new design. All our major institutions are broken.

So how do we get the word out?

There is an opportunity in a couple of weeks to showcase the potential of a design science approach to reinventing our systems and institutions. But first a little background...

I spent a lot of time working on a physics theories a few years back. One of the people who kept coming up was the mathematical physicist, John Baez, who is known for his work on loop quantum gravity and n-Category math. He is also amazing at teaching complex concepts, and his blog This Weeks finds in Mathematics is one many scientists have been following for a decade.

About 18 months ago, John decided to change his career focus from math and physics to solving our planet's major problem: especially climate and energy. He started a project called the Azimuth Project and I have been helping here and there for a bit over a year:

http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage

I started using Twitter and learning the social web only starting about a year ago largely because I felt social tools could help with Azimuth and in the process, I have found an amazing group of people all over the world who are each world-class at their particular gift. My personal goal has been to help build tech support for the global brain; the tools for curating, editing and presenting knowledge, for communicating, sense and decision making to help the amazing people I have found be more effective in helping save the planet.

John recently brought up the idea of AnyBot, which is a robot that lets one have an autonomous presence for remote sites, a physical avatar that can move about the room, etc. Since there is so much design science and whole-systems-thinking talent here, I applauded this approach and wrote him an email outlining some ways that other types of systems-level thinking could create change on the scale required for us to save the planet.

John was really inspired by the concepts of system-level change. So much so that he arranged to do a Google's campus and wrote a blog post about it here:

http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/i-robot/ 

John's talk is in a bit over two weeks.

John also asked me: "If you know anyone who might want to film this talk, that would be great. If you know ways to publicize it, that'd be great too.  And if know striking results that prove we can massively cut carbon emissions, that would be best of all!"

So I was hoping that some here might want to help. 

Can we work together to help John show the world how we can solve our major problems through design science applied on a massive scale? Can we show ways to massively cut carbon emissions without reducing quality of life?

Are we up to the challenge?

Some problems have solutions. Some problems are so complex that no one can figure them out. That's why we need you.
 
Some problems are dead obvious. But still don't seem to get fixed. The whole world watches as we fly off the cliff with nary a touch of the brakes.
 
Well, tighten the straps on your parachutes and grab your superhero costume. We've got some work to do. EdgeRyders and the black swan surfers from the Next Edge—from all over Europe and the world—are converging on London to take action.
 
Are you old enough to realize we're fucked without some major global systems surgery, yet young enough to believe you can perform actual surgery on yourself with just a bottle of whiskey, a shard of broken glass, and a smartphone?
 
Are you the best in the world at what you do? A deeply caring person that won't sit back and watch our world burn without doing something. Do you want to be a part of a global team of thinkers that do, turning theory into action into results, in the real world, and in timeframes that will make governments blush?
 
Is your response to the global paralysis: We're not going to be the generation that fucked the planet for the entire Millenium. Not on my watch. Heeeeylll No!
 
Join us at Edge Camp LDN where we will be bringing together a global team to tackle a key problem of modern society. The people who are doing what we all should be doing can't get paid, while the people who are doing the most harm are dancing in piles of dosh; wining and dining in the halls of power.

I was thinking what the 1st game should be, for the glass bead game, I think it should be ACTA, considering that its an endgame. Using TNE as a counter-meme, could also be a channel to spread about TNE, and people could catch on to it, in no time. It will let people around the world know there is another option. Thoughts?

This article sets up the next economic paradigm series that I am publishing.  The specs will describe an economy where factors of production are no longer allocations of land, labor, and capital - rather, communities would allocate social, creative, and intellectual capital to produce the things that they need. Edge Camp London

Edge Camp - Where the Next Edge take Ideas to Plans to Action
 
Some problems have solutions. Some problems are so complex that no one can figure them out. That's why we need you.
 
Some problems are dead obvious. But still don't seem to get fixed. The whole world watches as we fly off the cliff with nary a touch of the brakes.
 
Well, tighten the straps on your parachutes and grab your superhero costume. We've got some work to do. EdgeRyders and the black swan surfers from the Next Edge—from all over Europe and the world—are converging on London to take action.
 
Are you old enough to realize we're fucked without some major global systems surgery, yet young enough to believe you can perform actual surgery on yourself with just a bottle of whiskey, a shard of broken glass, and a smartphone?
 
Are you the best in the world at what you do? A deeply caring person that won't sit back and watch our world burn without doing something. Do you want to be a part of a global team of thinkers that do, turning theory into action into results, in the real world, and in timeframes that will make governments blush?
 
Is your response to the global paralysis: We're not going to be the generation that fucked the planet for the entire Millenium. Not on my watch. Heeeeylll No!
 
Join us at Edge Camp London where we will be bringing together a global team to tackle a key problem of modern society. The people who are doing what we all should be doing can't get paid, while the people who are doing the most harm are dancing in piles of dosh; wining and dining in the halls of power.
 
Our economy is backwards.
 
We're going to unbackwards it.
 
Bring your best to Hub Westminster. This weekend, Saturday 28 Jan 10 AM to the point of exhaustion, and Sunday 29 Jan 10 AM to 5 PM, as we launch a series monthly worldwide techno-jam global hackathons, called Edge Camps, where we redesign our world and build the solutions to our most pressing global problems.

Edge Camp will be run using Harrison Owen's Open Space Technology organizing principles. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology
 
NOTE for EdgeRyders: This edge camp will cover the following EdgeRyder campaign themes: We the People, Resilience and Making a Living.

We have a *public* Facebook Group for attendees called: Edge Camp LDN

Please join us if you want to take part in the discussions. There will be links and UStream and Twitter updates and Skype or Hangout connections for those who cannot attend in person.

If you can't make this camp, don't worry. These are going to happen somewhere every month. If you want to help plan an Edge Camp, please post in the comments and I'll add you to the *secret* Planning and Logistics subgroup.

Edge Camp - Where the Next Edge take Ideas to Plans to Action http://www.weforum.org/content/great-transformation-shaping-new-models Hi! so we have an open play space here - what should we do with it? a space for creative collaboration.... I would like to 'observe' or participate if appropriate in Social Platforms, and other circles where an Anthropologist point of view might be beneficial. Thanks ! Yesterday in Blommberg: 
Capitalism Seen in Crisis by Investors

Questions:
1. Tipping Point?
2. US when will you wake up? The world is waiting! OWS we love you!

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/capitalism-seen-in-crisis-by-investors.html http://www.ingenesist.com/general-info/the-5-pillars-of-the-inevitable-economy.html Thanks, James Burns, for meeting with me and talking about our nature as humans, self-org groups, community, and God over peach and blueberry pie. :-) Such an honor to share time and pie with such a kind and generous person. Entrepreneurship in community as the best check against predatory power. Interesting. I appreciate the practicality of his vision.  Global treaty based organizations and networks/connectedness are predominant themes in the global power shift as he describes it.  My question is, what his he missing? For me I think it is something about the capacity of individuals to create extra-national (intra-national?) communities. Can this be "democratized"? Is that a good thing? http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2012/01/making-universities-obsolete.html I seek a wiki master, might the parties who created the edge group wiki please contact me? or please feel free to point wiki skills in my direction thinking about the concept of tithing, and bringing in that frame to think about how we fund the types of tools & activities we want produced that become public goods and property of the commons; the cultural production that forms our emerging scenius and is the expression of its underpinning value systems. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe In search for a position that will shift more of my time in dedicating to this movement in helping to improve our ecosystem and to work for an organization more aligned with my goals and principles. Would appreciate any help necessary to take me to the right path. I have experience in Economics, Finance, and Systems Analysis. Thanks! http://www.linkedin.com/in/tammychan The knowledge enterprise - PROBLEM!
I proposed a solution: the "scientific oeuvre".

I met someone at McGill University today and we had a passionate discussion about our scientific institutions and their problems. 4 years ago I wrote about it and I decided to share this essay with you here. Someone might find it interesting and take it further. 
https://sites.google.com/site/tibisphilosophy/home/the-scientific-oeuvre hyper-SOPA, hilarious on its face, but then this might actually work!

https://twitter.com/#!/NerdyChristie/status/161897864002416640 If you had an opportunity to ask President Obama one question in a Google+ hangout, what would it be? 

(I was asked to make a 20-second video submission; the best videos will be posted on YouTube and 10 people chosen to participate in a Google+ hangout with the President.) 18 amazing speakers on-line: Leo Babauta, Carole Brown, Brian Clark, Jonathan Fields, Charlie Gilkey, Maggie Ginsberg-Schutz, Matt Glowaki, Seth Godin, Joe Hall, Thor Holt, Warren MacDonald, Anissa Mayhew, Jon Morrow, Amber “Miss Destructo” Osborne, Amber Rae, Julien Smith, John Unger, and Tommy Walker. Does anyone know of a way to set up a system that will recognize when someone has started talking and begin recording? We have to grow from the inside out. None can teach us, none can make us spiritual. There is no other teacher but our own Soul! Vivekananda Apparently the IMF seems to be among the last of humanity to know this. I wrote this for a recent government panel. I hope it's informative & a little bit inspiring for the crowd here... 

http://www.urbeingrecorded.com/news/2012/01/23/discontinuity-opportunity-in-a-hyper-connected-world/ Welcome back, Lion Kimbro ! Out of curiosity, what would you say if you had 15 minutes to present on education for a climate changing world at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre this week? ;) This is from an old creative Kuwaiti acquintance of mine, Naif Al-Mutawa, who was at Columbia U when his early exploration with entrepreneurial initiatves made our paths cross.. Years apart then I read an article in a magazine in Dubai referring to his comic book and the fact that Obama makes a reference to it. Here is the link to Obama's speach and ... now Naif asks members of his social network to share this link about his new related film coming out in Feb . Pleasure to share with you.

<3 http://www.no-straight-lines.com/blog/the-no-straight-lines-challenge-be-realistic-imagine-the-impossible/ Which capacities need to be developed to cultivate a sense of Global Citizenship? How might these capacities be developed, in your view? I'm giving a talk on this subject and would be interested in your feedback. What does global citizenship look like to someone living in Brazil vs the US? Does it even get on the radar in Haiti? Is it more than a worldview? I look forward to your feedback and any resources you'd care to offer. another take on Occupy Wall St West which aimed to challenge corporate personhood and Citizens United Supreme Court ruling With great Love and respect for all present <3

Is there anyone in this group who genuinely either does not know what we are here for, or cannot see what it is we are actually accomplishing by being here?

I think it is important to be able to have an open and generative group discussion to clarify and galvanize the cohesiveness of our interactions, especially as there seems to be some dissent and or discontent expressed in some corners which if left unresolved could become a liability to the overall venture of seeding a better future for All.  

Calling for some radical clarifying self-responsibility! Got a problem? now is  your opportunity to have it addressed :-)

Also, who is willing to openly state their deepest intention in relation to the greater good of all who benefit directly or indirectly from the activities of the members of this group?

"Pivot" has pivoted into political pundits' every sentence. Wondering when they will pivot to another buzz word. I suggest "swivel." It seems to better describe the thoughts, words and actions of politicians. Agree? Just because two people argue, it doesn’t mean they don’t love each other and just because they don’t argue, it doesn’t mean they do! http://www.toms.com/ A friend pointed me to this very Apple-friendly article in the NY Times.  I was stunned by this passage. Why does Apple/Jobs get so much love? 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

“Apple’s an example of why it’s so hard to create middle-class jobs in the U.S. now,” said Jared Bernstein, who until last year was an economic adviser to the White House.

“If it’s the pinnacle of capitalism, we should be worried.”

Apple executives say that going overseas, at this point, is their only option. One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone’s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight.

A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company’s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day.

“The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,” the executive said. “There’s no American plant that can match that.”

Similar stories could be told about almost any electronics company — and outsourcing has also become common in hundreds of industries, including accounting, legal services, banking, auto manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.

But while Apple is far from alone, it offers a window into why the success of some prominent companies has not translated into large numbers of domestic jobs. What’s more, the company’s decisions pose broader questions about what corporate America owes Americans as the global and national economies are increasingly intertwined.

“Companies once felt an obligation to support American workers, even when it wasn’t the best financial choice,” said Betsey Stevenson, the chief economist at the Labor Department until last September. “That’s disappeared. Profits and efficiency have trumped generosity.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=4&pagewanted=all "Most of my life was spent at war with the characters — including the lead, me — in my story. They weren’t good enough, or smart enough, or deep enough. At one point in the story of me, none of us were rich enough. At another point, when material possessions were disdained, none of us were poor enough. It was never right. It could always be better. Sometime in the future, I could make my story turn out to fit my latest idealization, or so I hoped. For four decades I worked at building a story that would fulfill me. Periods of happiness and peace came and went. Lasting happiness remained out of my grasp. It took some time to realize that the lasting fulfillment I was seeking couldn’t be captured by any story I told about myself. The fulfillment I was seeking in my many attempts to tell a story of victory couldn’t be captured because it is free. It took more time to realize that my story was mysteriously appearing in that which is already fulfilled. It was a beautiful and wonderful shock to discover that freedom and fulfillment were never absent whatever the latest rendition of my story. My story was an individual display of the search for the living free consciousness already inhabiting each character. When I recognized the silent fulfilled core in all versions of myself — and all the others in my story — I could rest. In the spaciousness of rest, I could begin to live my life from fulfillment, rather than continuing to search for it."

http://vividlife.me/ultimate/22087/read-what-is-your-story-by-gangaji/ we've been talking for a while about recording "Heartsongs" here in The Next Edge - short videos where we talk about what passions drive us. (ht Lauren Higgins for suggesting the word 'heartsong').

no one did it so far (afaik), so i took the initiative and recorded one this morning. if anyone wants to help build out the Heartsong Project into a website where we could inspire people to start sharing their visions and passions, let me know!

http://bit.ly/wZbMAO And when you have definitive proof that someone is at best inconsiderate of the needs of those they convene to build their reputation for being knowledgeable, and at worst they lie and steal, and they are deeply enmeshed in a community because they "add value" (by aggregating peoples' private information on behalf of those who either don't know how they do this or don't care) what is to be done? Is the only option waiting out the rise and fall of this person's reputation and disassociating one's self from them in the meantime? cc: Jean Russell, David Hodgson, Jerry Michalski. I got a question... What do people do here, to calm down, and take all of this in? I am very compromised, in my current situation, and its not like I really have anyone else to ask. I know I will be out of it, soon enough, but in the meantime I am still in it. I also suffer from clutter. I am a good speaker and writer, but I am having such an overload. I feel safe talking about these things with this group. So please... enlighten me. I trust all of you. Next Edge = curatorial community. Motivated by Steve Wright's push to go from innovation to execution, and to figure out what we are collaborating on, I'd like to make the following observations and offering. 

First, I believe that the best current/practical answer to what NE is is a 'curatorial community'; we all have unique radars for ideas, and this is a place where those can be shared and explored. Our interactions 'curate' those. That curation is an ad hoc 'attention management' and asset mapping process.

So I would suggest that we identify that as our 'collaboration' and focus on actualizing the tools that make that work optimally.

Buckminster Fuller Institute ( www.bfi.org ) , Planetwork (www.planetwork.net ), and my company Sociative are collaborating on adapting our 'discovery engine' techniques (e.g. www.occupylive.org ) to the domain of what we're calling 100% Solutions, which is thematically isomorphic with NE. 

Anyone interested, please explore www.OccupyLive.org and imagine:

1. The Live Raw Feeds on the left would be NextEdge-relevant, e.g. every url shared by any Next Edger, every url shared by TED speakers, the 'penumbras' of those (others related to but not yet members of), experts in specific topic areas like Green Cities, etc.

2. The other tabs would be the categories/topics that Venessa started exploring earlier in the month, and wherever further evolution takes it. 

3. Any Edger could tag any story with any topic(s) they think it's relevant to. This is currently done by a few moderators but could be opened up to many.

4. Such tagging makes each tab an archive and asset map. Those become long-term tools for research, remembrance, etc.

5. Every story would have a comment section / G+ Hangout or whatever analog we want to the Facebook commenting here. OccupyLive has a Facebook comment window on each story but we think this can be greatly improved on.

6. Features missing from OccupyLive we might want include Most Recently Commented On (effectively, what this group is), Most Recently Clicked, ...

We have a working prototype and will share that as soon as it's available. The system is currently Twitter only, but it's architected to handle FB, G+, LinkedIn, Connect.me, any service. We've already created an 'influencer network' of all the NextEdgers we could find on Twitter (~380). Those without Twitter accounts could get them and just automatically forward FB updates there.

I'll leave it there for now. Very interested in everyone's feedback, and in particular, what features need to be in such a 'shared curatorial environment'.

Brad DeGraf Bill Clinton writing in the FT today says: Charity alone will not solve the world’s problems. Capitalism can help and at the same time put people back to work. I'll go along with that http://www.ecademy.com/node.php?id=169485 I am drawn to the idea of aligning incentives right now.  A lot of my work centers on how to get multiple players throughout an ecosystem to cooperative intensely enough to generate an outcome that is greater than the sum of the parts.  This is my tactical/working definition of emergence.  

I work in international development.  In my work here is the group of players: 1) Practitioners, 2) Academics, 3) Funders, 4) Intermediaries.  And here are the rough incentive paradigms: 1) Business Management, 2) Proof of "Impact", 3) Profit/Revenue.  I believe that if I could map these incentives and these players accurately I would have a powerful template for understanding what I need to sell to whom.

Any insight anyone has on the specifics of this or the more general process of aligning incentives would be greatly appreciated. I'd like to introduce Paul Downton and Chérie Hoyle to this group - they have been effective advocates for ecological architecture and eco-city ideas for over 25 years, and the driving force behind the manifestation of a 'piece of ecocity' in the CBD of Adelaide, South Australia - thought you all might like this story... How does one know that he's asking the right question? How to improve one's skill of asking questions? The single most powerful thing any of us can do is to help the people/orgs that are good at moving the needle to move it faster.  There are two ways to do that.

1) Better management/operations/services/products
2) Better collaboration for emergence: 1+1>2

There is nothing new.  The Next Edge is being formed every day, every minute.  There is no new version. Cultural versioning is retrospective or speculative, not development. The practical version of ideation is sales and marketing.

More, better, faster. any reflections around this topic? :)

________________________________________________ love and fever .. and food! Dear Edgelings. It looks like Hollywood is on it's way to a victory. While the world has had it's eyes on Washington an attempt to sneak in legislation that is the predecessor of SOPA into Europe. Watch the video below so you understand why ACTA is a bad. bad. bad. idea. Let the potential consequences sink in. Here's what you can do about it:

1. Sign this petition and share it on Facebook and Twitter:
https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/just-say-no-to-acta

2. Make a phone call to your local Polish Embassy: Tell them to please not sign the ACTA agreement, that the whole world is watching.

3. Take time this evening to email your MEP and someone in your national Parliament.

Yes. You are buisy. We all are. Let's talk about how busy you are.
Do you work in communications or run communication-instensive efforts online? Are you in Tech?  Without a functioning Internet, you could be a whole lot less busy. It's worth spending an hour or less to to try to make sure we have it tomorrow. Consider it an investment in your future :)

Now google "MEP" + "your country" and find their email address. And write that email telling them that if they do pass it we will know who sold our future down the river. Tell them that the whole world is watching them. That we will never forget they killed the single best thing that has happened to humanity. And remind them that the political price of this treason is not one they want to pay. Copy past the same message into the email to your national parliamentarian of choice. You can use the text I posted on Neelie Kroes wall as a template if you don't know what to write (scroll down till you find my post): https://www.facebook.com/NeelieKroes

Get ready to do this again. And again. And every single time an attempt is made to sneak an outright attack on the infrastructure that enables our lives and work into our legislation. It's exhausting. I know. Just do via Justin Pickard. My research agenda 'Design Resilience: Tactics for Strategic Design', is now online. I would love to hear all your thoughts on it. Cheers! Edge Camp - Syncing Up the Global Edge

Made a suggestion in Flemming Funch's Occupy the Edge thread that got some positive traction so I want to fork off a separate thread here to develop ideas and see who might be interested. The basic idea was to create focal points for Next Edge camps with themes that change monthly.

I'll summarize the main points of my original proposal ( with some additions):

- Monthly camps somewhere in the world as hub for global event
- No frills Open Space rules in low cost location
- Broad topic agenda switches each month
- Satellite camps everywhere anyone wants to set one up
- Streaming video using UStream/LiveStream for hub and satellites
- Work together to help provide travel/room/board for those who need it
- Camp hub switches between continents each month
- Agenda determined by hub
- Point of camp is doing, deciding, hacking of all sorts
- Length: perhaps 2 main days (and following week for some)

Goals:
- Get us working together
- Build trust between Edgers and various global groups
- Work products we can use to help each other and the world

Syncing:
- Fractal cycles revolving around the year-month-quarter
- Big annual theme
- Medium quarterly theme
- Local monthly theme within quarterly/annual context

Meta-Meeting:
- Determine meta rules for logistics and process
- Topics, locations and schedules for first few camps
- Sometime next week before holidays set in
- Either NYC or Washington D.C. area
- network/phone links for those who can't come in person.

Suggested First Camp:
- Hub Westminster
- January 28/29 with following week for those who want
- Topic: Helping the global precariat so they can focus on their work

Suggestions and comments are most welcome. What would you like to see? Topics and locations for the future? People's Reserve Credit Union, modeled on Grameen in California http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/NA24Dj04.html Do you agree? I’ve learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them....! Fascinating white paper about a few of the necessary conditions for cooperation to proliferate. Suggestion.
A weekly ONE DOABLE THING.
Example.This week that one doable thing (for I crown it thusly and imperiously) is Venessa Miemis's request for each to create a Heartsong video. We may not ALL be able to do it but a good chunk of us can. It is a task that is discrete, does not take a great deal of technical skill, has potential for high impact. 

I don't propose this in opposition to the bigger more weedy projects. Rock on! But it emerges often that there is pent up energy here not really being expressed. 

Next week it might be Write a brief piece for the Next Edge blog, - answer this survey... each week something DOABLE which does not take three days or deeeeeeep commitment of time and resource. My assumption is that we all have something to contribute...but it doesn't always fit with our other work or skills. Sometimes it's very difficult to tease out from conversations here HOW to contribute. 

Let's take Venessa's lead and make very small, discrete asks! Adam Scislowicz Are Ishan Markandeya and Gavin Keech friends of yours? Or in your circle of UX designers and storytellers? Their work is outstanding and they're both Next Edge members.

I found Gavin's work on personas, for example, to be extremely resonant with stick-figure-like by comparison isofractal taxonomy/ontology work, and the Junto logo was awesome.

http://gavin.notthisbody.com/#802666/ent_pm-personas

And the post from Ishan's blog entitled: "entanglement's heart embrace and the flow of information" seems very on-point (with a graphic by Gavin?)

Does anyone know of others within the group doing similar or overlapping work? cc: Kevin Mullet The Price of your Soul: How the Brain Decides Whether to Sell Out 

A neuro-imaging study shows that personal values that people refuse to disavow, even when offered cash to do so, are processed differently in the brain than those values that are willingly sold.

“Our experiment found that the realm of the sacred – whether it’s a strong religious belief, a national identity or a code of ethics – is a distinct cognitive process,” says Gregory Berns, director of the Center for Neuropolicy at Emory University and lead author of the study. The results were published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/ The idea has come up to create a contemporary version of Herman Hesse's Glass Bead Game as a way for Next Edgers to provide a forum for discovering interconnected knowledge that integrates all fields of endeavor and provide tangible methods for creating a sustainable society. Anyone interested in pursuing this? cc Curtis Faith, Irma Wilson, Gunter Wehmeyer, David Hodgson, Venessa Miemis... Are you looking for funding? Venture Capital? 
Rock The Post may be a solution! It is a business social network placed in Silicon Valley, developed by people from the States, Canada & Spain ;)

my post from the other day is a lot to unpack, but many of us are arriving at the same conclusions: we need to activate our individual BuilderShips, get our personal agency engines running, and bootstrap ourselves so the creative economy can emerge. 

people have been coming forward in the past few days and telling me - "what you described in your post..... i've been working on almost an identical model! but my metaphors and language around it are different."

perfect. i want to pull together a blog post that shows all the various ways you can describe your personal agency engine [PAE].

let me know what yours is, if you want to share it, and i'll do a mockup of it and add it to the post. this is how we make this happen.

http://bit.ly/xZV49J those of the Next Edge in SF may find this event of interest - thanks to Kevin O'Malley My abstract is now posted for The 2012 Bioethics Conference: "The Moral Brain". :)

Andrea Kuszewski -- "Enhancing Morality by Strengthening the Moral Decision-Making Mechanisms"

Abstract: How do we determine the moral value of behavior? Is morality based on a set of fixed rules, or is it conditional to the circumstances surrounding the behavior? If we look at moral behavior as being context-dependent, then how can we effectively enhance morality? It isn’t necessary to specifically define “morality” as a construct in order to enhance moral behavior—through resilience training that focuses on emotion regulation and cognitive control, morality can be improved as a byproduct. In essence, we can make it more likely that a person will be able to make a moral decision when confronted with these circumstances if they have the best cognitive and emotional tools to work with. I will discuss a three-part training methodology that can enhance moral behavior by strengthening the moral decision-making mechanisms themselves.

What does that make possible? Dear US-based  Edgelings: After head of MPAA Chris Dodd publicly admitted bribing politicians to push through PIPA and SOPA, it would be nice to have him investigated and maybe even prosecuted, wouldn't it?

We are on a journey together in which our metamorphosis is joined. The future of the FOOD SYSTEM. 
I am increasingly involved in understanding and changing the food system. Most of my energy in this field is released through "#occupy New Economy", but also through SENSORICA and Greener Acres. Here's a page I wrote on Multitude Project about it, I would like to get your reactions... This page will evolve in the future based on feedback, constructive criticism, my growing experience, etc. 
https://sites.google.com/site/multitude2008/Home/economy/economical-alternatives/production-distribution-of-agricultural-products hi all!

i've been working on mockups the past few days for next-gen profiles for the Collaboratory, and trying to think about what fields we want to create so people can express themselves more fully. this comes back to our 'asset mapping' conversations and how we can show our desires / passions / intentions / resources more easily so we can align around values and projects and get shift done. 

anyway, this is just v1, but would love any feedback.

http://emergentbydesign.com/2012/01/20/developing-next-gen-profiles-collaboratory-mockup/ Hi friends, sharing my latest thoughts on 2012 and the paradigm shift.. pulling together familiar threads, though hopefully in a new light. I was just responding to some comments in another post about my work with Holacracy, and thought I'd share a reference with the whole group here - it's a pretty radical new "operating system" for purpose-driven human organization.  Here's an 8-minute video introducing the method; and for those looking for more, check out the 60-minute intro video at www.holacracy.org/resources/video-introduction-holacracy (there are articles and blog posts on holacracy.org as well). A collection of youtube-talks that changed me - an online workshop. Part I.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M9yPMVv9ac Would the concept of "mechanism of action" from chemistry be applicable in psychology? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action Logic Models: as many of you know, the purpose of a Logic Model or Theory of Change is to map our activities to the world we want to see.  I would like to point out two recent news stories that highlight the need for logic models.

The first is microfinance in Anda Pradesh.  Bad incentives and aggressive profit/financial targets pushed loan officers to poor outcomes.  Instead of tying the loan officers actions to specific outcomes in the lives of the poor, they were tied to profit numbers of the orgs that served the poor and there was no clear connection to that orgs financial success and the success of the poor clients.  That what a logic model is for.

In the you tube video below (thanks Jessica Margolin) you see the same outcome in policing. Quotas aare established for numbers that have no logical connection to the right outcome. I'm having such conflicting reactions to this video. Any thoughts from Next Edger's? it would be good to magnify the profile of Slow Money... Rise of the Edge-pert:  saw this from Andrew Taylor and thought of the next edgers: 
http://www.artsjournal.com/artfulmanager/main/the-rise-of-the-edge-pert.php Very interesting article from TechCrunch on the wasted opportunity (my words) of technologists.  Look at what we just saw is possible with SOPA / PIPA. We went for a backroom deal that they hoped would sneak through to public embarrassment as backpeddling that killed an otherwise sure thing.  The reason why SOPA/PIPA were written has very little to do with pirating (not nothing, but very little).  They were written to protect the privileged market position of entertainment arbiters in the face of innovation that makes them nearly irrelevant.  (Same idea with Big Oil and and alternative energy though not so stark in that we still really need oil.)

I find that technology, communications technology in particular, is littered with powerful examples of what if...  What if Cable TV and Community Access wasn't crippled by funding and end-of-dial regulation? What if we wre allowed to leverage the foundational P2P architecture of the Internet to create connections between difference and "other" instead of like-interests?

We know know what is possible if the new-tech industry comes together to apply pressure against regulation.  What if they were to realize the Citizen's United is exactly the same threat as SOPA/PIPA?  What if they were to realize that what is passing for political discourse was least-common-denominator and then decided to do something about it?  What if the something they decided to do didn't provide a revenue boost to this FQ but provided a win for their customers, their communities, the commons.  What-if...

http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/do-great-things/ "Advancing the Global Citizens Movement. The global transformation will require the awakening of a new social actor: a vast movement of global citizens expressing a supranational identity and building new institutions for a planetary age. Such a global citizens movement (GCM) would work on all fronts, comprehending the various struggles for the environment and justice as different expressions of a common project. It would understand itself as an explicit and proactive advocate for a planetary civilization worthy of the name. Unlike national citizenship that excludes the disenfranchised, all people, by dint of their humanity, are citizens of the planetary community we must imagine as an ideal and build as a collective project. The idea and practice of global citizenship is spreading, but a coherent GCM that engages masses of people remains latent, ready to be born. Giving life to this critical actor, now missing from the world stage, stands as the next phase in the evolution of civil society activism." I am sharing this post as the term "social imaginaries" is new to me and I know so many of you here on TheNextEdge are exactly that.

I also want to share I live in Rochester where Kodak was founded. There is a lot of noise about their failure. I see each micro as a macro and feel that the metaphor for Kodak is a metaphor for us-- especially us in the US. Here are some core questions I am reminding myself as I participate in the collective mourning of the death of the past

Kodak's demise isn't about Kodak. It is about our attachment to the past and how dangerous it is to not keep interrogating reality. #ROC

Kodak's demise is not about Kodak. It is about us.
Where are we not paying attention to the macro and the impact of change?
Where are we attached to what we have created so far?
Where are we not listening to our shareholders?
Where are we arrogant?
Where are we needing to un-learn?

The Unitarian Universalist Church on Cedar Street is letting us use their space. The truth about the economy, politics and the power of the 1% revealed. I was fascinated by this BBC report about a miracle energy storage material that scientists have recently figured out how to make. The raw material is totally abundant. The report claims that within ten years this material can be brought to market as a standard components in batteries around the world of all sizes and that by doing so we can potentially increase the range of all electric vehicles by 1500% without any increase in weight. If this proves so, it could have substantial implications not just for the way we drive, but for a plethora of activities for which we would manufacture different kinds of technological solutions if we had batteries that could last that much longer. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-16596123. I'd be curious if yall think the report is plausible. Given that shipping's Baltic Dry Index is below 1,000 for the first time since January 2009, does this suggest the real economy is tanking? How to be happy? If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.

At first glance, it's just digtal sticky notes.  But you can have 15 projects/desktops, each with a custom photo background (e.g. mini vision board).  The UI allows fast (2-click) switching between projects.  The notes themselves have a variety of styles, so it's possible to have a "busy" collection of notes which are still easily differentiated.  Good for anyone who is visually oriented and regularly context switching. This is a post inspired by a fascinating thread that Jordan Greenhall and Bret Weinstein started recently, my own responses to that thread, and some of the responses Liz McLellan offered up. 

The Concept of "Buttressing"

http://goonth.posterous.com/is-there-really-a-tipping-point-to-innovation# If these SOPA/PIPA laws end up passing, then I propose we make an alternate internet where any content from those who supported SOPA/PIPA is explicitly banned. This alternate internet would go out of it's way to only support file types of a certain kind. So, it would be up to Hollywood companies to make sure their releases can never be converted to these file types. Since their content would be explicitly banned from our internet, if it appears on our internet anyway somehow, they agree to pay users of our alternate internet 1 billion US$ per infraction, and will voluntarily imprison themselves for 10 years for allowing their banned content to contaminate our alternate internet. Calling all Inventors of the Future! Dear Next Edgers, I am inspired to extend this call for submissions for the Artifacts of the Future exhibition at the upcoming @Communikey Festival 2012.  The exhibition invites artists and technologists to create potential visions or solutions to the complex problems of a sustainable future in a digitally driven world. Any Next Edge thoughts or visions of digital culture in the sustainability era? Interesting article about SOPA/PIPA by Clay Shirky-- really draws a much broader more detailed picture of the dystopian future that could result if they would pass. http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/18/sopa-pipa-consumption-only-internet Inspiring and thought-provoking post from Cynthia La Grou's Compathos:

http://emergentbydesign.com/2012/01/16/intentcasting-an-epic-vision-how-to-bootstrap-creative-economy-3-0/ Is the US Congress considering legislation now that could fatally damage the free open Internet taking us to a world without free knowledge? This week, a bill that would create America’s first Internet censorship system (using DNS blocking – the same censorship method used by China, Syria, Iran) is going to a full committee for a vote, and is likely to pass.  This bill attempts a radical restructuring of the laws governing the Internet, could effectively kill e-commerce or even normal Internet use, open source software projects may shut down under this bill.
It will enable and encourage broad censorship of the Internet in the name of suppressing distribution of works not authorized by copyright holders.  SOPA could threaten the functioning, freedom, and economic potential of the Internet by:
• short-circuiting the legal system, giving rightsholders a fast-track to shutting down whole websites; 
• creating conflicts between Domain Name System (DNS) servers, making you more vulnerable to hackers, identity theft, and cyberattacks; 
• sanctioning government interference with the Internet, making it more censored globally
• has little to no effect on actual piracy
SOPA threatens every site on Internet, but would especially harm the commons.

http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/11/infographic-effects-of-the-int.php Good analysis of SOPA/PIPA: "This push to censor the internet, through measures that would fundamentally break it, stems from a very clear understanding of what's at stake."

Amal sorry to worry you!!  I temporarily deactivated my facebook
account, in solidarity with wikipedia and wikileaks, we are doing a 24
hour blackout (until tomorrow night, my time) to protest the SOPA and
PIPA bills that are in the US congress right now, proposals to
regulate internet in certain ways in order to catch film/music
pirates, but which would have a censoring impact on everyone.  My
account will be reactivated in bit less than a day.

I should still be with all my groups and all my contacts when I come
back online there, facebook says it is easy to deactivate and
reactivate.  Let me know how you are in Cairo.
With love,
Jennifer
p.s.  if you notice, the English language wikipedia should also be
blacked out at this time. another cut of one of my favorite speeches :) via Edward Harran "Entrepreneurship has become the Ritalin of the masses, focusing their efforts on doing something “positive”.

http://scienceprogressaction.org/intersection/2012/01/our-scienceonline2012-session-covering-political-neuroscience-in-the-blogosphere/ "Corruption. The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently." - Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, The Dawn, Sec. 297, 1881. Isn't that what we today would call assortative mixing? homophily? Eli Pariser's concept of Filter Bubble? self-looping? group polarization? informational influence or persuasive arguments theory? confirmation bias? Or do you think Nietzsche was just talking about intolerance in general? 

Reminds me of another quote, by Albert Einstein this time.. puts it into perspective, I think: “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” I'm not an Apple fanboy, but I think their "Think Different" campaign sums up nicely what I was trying to say.. Risk thinking differently, risk offending, risk being met with violent opposition.. This is not a big "cocktail party" where you speak about the weather and mingle with Fairweather Friends, Fairweather "Brands"..

Real dialogue is not always pretty.. But I find on Facebook, Twitter, and on Blogs one is forced to be "nice"; if you don't like somebody's project or idea, you're "not supposed" to criticize, cause "criticism is futile" and other dicto simpliciter "lukewarm thoughts".. Say something constructive/nice or say nothing.. If I think your project/idea/work is an #epic #fail, don't I owe it to myself and to you, to tell you? But you'll certainly be flagged, deleted, blocked, unfriended, "unsubscribed" to..

Why is that, do you think? Why can't I tell you what I really think about your projects and ideas when I don't like them? The whole point of sentiment analysis is that there exists a thing called "negative" sentiment.. I think people need to be told what they're doing wrong when they are doing it.. it can only help them. If you can't take criticism of whatever harshness, you might be in the wrong business.. if your business is to sell ideas..

Designs are ideas too at one time, I think failure analysis is needed in a big way.. to help propel people into having "sounder" ideas.. I see a lot of people trying things that others have tried before and failed horribly.. Before engaging in any project, I like to know if it is even tenable/viable.. where it's likely to "fail" and fail "epicly".. That's how I inform my strategic choices.. I thought this was one of the better "mass media" segments on #SOPA I've seen to date; among many things, Chris Hayes has the balls to present the issue from both sides and engenders a fairly constructive (albeit heated) dialogue. Ohanian's imperative is the ringer: "Innovation NOT legislation is the solution." 

I would also offer that "piracy" is not about ownership, but connectivity (read: it's not really theft, especially when copyright is largely unenforceable in digital spaces). Tim O'Reilly recently made the sage point that if people are going to steal then you might as well give content away for free, because they weren't going to pay anyway. (If you have the time, check out the piece -- and 67-page deck -- I have up on my blog about this, or the WWTID website)

"There is no doubt that the father was correct to point out to his son the obligation that he had, but in quantifying that obligation, he converted it into a debt, for that is the difference between an obligation and a debt: an obligation becomes a debt when you can put a number on it. “I owe you one” is an obligation; “I owe somebody $10″ is a debt. Obligations bind people together even after they have been “paid.” But debts bind us only for as long as the debt exists. The relationship dies on payment of the debt. We might say that obligations bind us together, while debts drive us apart. " Bret Weinstein said, "The problem, Jordan Greenhall, is that we are running out of time. Futurism is looking increasingly like a fool's paradise..."  This strikes me as a fundamental that we should spend some time on.  To wit: what are our timelines and what forces (both human and inhuman) conspire to shape those timelines?  

What assumptions are being made to drive these models?  

What consequences to strategy and behaviour follow from the models?

By example, as Bret and I have discussed IRL, we share some similar assumptions about core forces (climate disruption, peak cheap oil, economic crisis) and what these entail for the world-as-we-know-it (hint: it aint a pretty picture).  Yet, due to what I presume are some additional and different core models, we have some disagreement about short term trajectory and optimal strategies.  

While my own models don't originally stem from Seb Paquet's, I find his articulation of "civilization dynamics" at http://emergentcities.sebpaquet.net/how-social-movements-happen-part-i-zenith-oss useful.   A crucial assumption that I make is that social psychology operates similar to individual psychology - it prefers to stick to a model it knows rather than leap into the unknown, even if the model it knows isn't working and that only a relatively substantial trauma can cause it to kick into "explore new territory mode".  *But that* once in explore new territory mode, it can deploy pattern discovery and creative destruction mechanisms that are almost unthinkable while in "everything is peachy" mode.  

Consequently, I anticipate (and to some extent look forward to ) a large scale crisis similar in both shape and consequence to an alcoholic's hitting rock bottom (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis#Definition_of_a_crisis) at which point *and only at which point* we (collectively) will become capable of rallying to the level of change that is necessary (and, hopefully,  sufficient) to deal with the serious dangers we face. 

Secondarily, I make the assumption that there are "in the present" instruments and ideas that are fundamentally "of the future" in the sense that they are part and parcel of the solution and not the problem.  "Edge networking" is a classic example.  These resources serve the dual function of hastening the collapse of the old system (ideally well in advance of a point where the rot is so severe that this collapse leads to a much larger species-extinction event) *and* serving as the "scaffolding" for the new model.  

In this context, my strategy is to:

a) Diagnose the ongoing crisis in an effort to identify "singularity points" (e.g., the tipping point where Mubarak goes from unassailable to fucked)

b) Identify the scaffolding and attempt to interpolate what the other pieces of the future model will look like

c) Assist in the formation of the new model - with an eye towards attempting to both make it the best that it can be and (recognizing that crisis often turns out badly) that the good future is more likely than the many potential bad futures.

d) Focusing on being prepared to act decisively when the tipping point hits, recognizing that there is an almost infinite force multiplier to be found here.

"We’re in much the same situation today. Our core narrative, the story into which every serious thinker is required to fit his or her thoughts, is the narrative of progress—the story that defines all of human existence as a single great upward trajectory from the caves to the stars, and insists that the present is better than the past and the future will inevitably be better still. The problem with that narrative, of course, is that for most people the present is significantly worse than the past—standards of living for most Americans, for example, have been declining for more than thirty years—and the future promises to be even worse than the present. The narrative of progress has no room for that perception; in public life, the only way in which it’s possible to bring it up at all is to suggest that someone or something is to blame for the temporary lack of progress, and then offer a plan to get the obstacle out of the way so that progress can get under way once more.

Politicians, pundits, and serious thinkers of every kind have been making exactly this argument for a good many decades, though, and it’s started to sink in across a very broad range of the social spectrum that something has gone very wrong. There have been, so far, two main responses to this recognition. The surge in apocalyptic prophecies is one of them; the logical response when one narrative fails to make sense of the world is to look for another narrative that does a better job, after all, and the narrative of apocalypse—more precisely, the religious narrative of paradise, fall, and redemption in which apocalyptic prophecy has its natural habitat—is one of the very few alternatives that most people in industrial societies are willing to take seriously.

.....

Mulling over this question a few days ago, I started making a list of the more obvious features of the story in which we find ourselves at this point in the turning of history’s wheel. I encourage my readers to follow along, and see whether or not the answer that struck me occurs to them as well.

• We live in a world dominated by a vast, slowly decaying empire that gets quite literally superhuman powers by feeding on what we may as well call the blood of the Earth;

• That empire is ruled by a decadent aristocracy that holds court in soaring towers and bolsters its crumbling authority by conjuring vast amounts of wealth out of thin air;

• Backing the aristocracy is a caste of corrupt sorcerers whose incantations, projected into every home through the power of the blood of the Earth, keep the populace disorganized, deluded and passive;

• Entire provinces of the empire are ravaged by droughts, storms, and other disasters caused by the misuse of the Earth’s blood, while prophecies from the past warn of much worse to come;

• Meanwhile, far from the centers of power, the members of a scattered fellowship struggle to find and learn the forgotten lore of an earlier time, which might just hold the secret of survival...

It was more or less at this point that the realization hit: we have somehow gotten stuck, all seven billion of us, inside the pages of a pulp fantasy novel.

.....

By this point, though, I suspect that you, dear reader, are wondering about one detail. If we’re actually stuck inside the pages of a trashy fantasy novel, as I’ve suggested, and all the details of the setting and the plot are in place, where is the protagonist? Who is the hero or the heroine who will turn the pages of the long-lost Gaianomicon, use its forgotten lore to forge a wand of power out of the rays of the Sun, shatter the deceptive spells of the lords of High Finance, and rise up amidst the wreckage of a dying empire to become one of the seedbearers of an age that is not yet born?

Why, you are, of course." Why are we concerned about low volatility? It is just a little too calm. Either up or down, we appear to be setting up for a major break! anyone out there feel like going to Rio?

As a non-American now resident in the US, my personal MLK Day (tomorrow) listening / reading will be this speech, mainly the last third, after the Vietnam bit is done. The section begins:

"Now there is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say we must enter that struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing. The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality...and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing "clergy and laymen concerned" committees for the next generation...

I recommend it but would also love to hear what others will be doing to get the most out of this anniversary of possibly the greatest ambassador of peace of the 20th century?

PS My favourite piece of the talk is this:

"We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says:

We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says:

'Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word (unquote).'

We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at flood -- it ebbs. We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, "Too late.""

in the futures process for the German Chancellor I am charged with addressing the following questions and would very much love to bring in your extensive knowledge and experience from around the world: 

1. Many nations, regions and cities are currently rethinking their priorities and what they want their future to look like. What are good ways for societies to achieve a shared understanding of what a high quality of life is? What are the challenges on this way? Where has this been done successfully?
2. For societies to move toward the future they would like to see it is important that time and money are spent with the largest impact on quality of life. So we need measurement. What are general characteristics of good measures of quality of life? What is a good example for such a measure?
3. What kind of institutions do societies need to address challenging and complex long-term issues such as the improvement of quality of life? Please provide general characteristics and examples.

Comments, links, answers etc all highly welcome, even if only to one of theses questions. Or are these the wrong questions to ask? Many thanks (and sorry for long post)

What are the implications? http://p2pfoundation.net/Market_3.0 I have a few thoughts on this discussion of 'ideal societies' and how to get there. The key to a better society is not merely 'detecting and eliminating' sociopaths, nor is it finding a better filtering/punishing/shaming system, nor is is building a more efficient trust network that minimizes the chances of ill-intent spoiling the good apples. 

The key to really changing society is to make good, moral behavior *intrinsically rewarding* for the individual. Intrinsic motivation to move in a positive direction will always be more effective than attempting to thwart or punish the bad. Not to say that bad behavior can't and shouldn't be dealt with—obviously anyone who knows me knows my opinion on that. But that can't be the entire plan to shape a society. We've been doing that for ages. Look around you; it isn't working.

My point is this: You can't shame or punish someone into patterns of behavior that will be long-lasting, or expect to change their core beliefs or attitudes. That must happen from within. If you strengthen and nurture the core, then those resulting decisions, behaviors, and attitudes can change. Everything else that merely acts to punish existing behaviors is just a band-aid and isn't sustainable for a society. Not if we want one that's significantly different than the one we have today. 

My thought for the day... :) That's why they call it Tantraaaah! To say there are a lot of ideas in here would be an understatement. The question that is coming up across the world in thousands of communities is around actualizing ideas. It's fuzzy and that's good...for now.

With much joy, I like to share with you a story I tracked with my Iphone camera and chats I picked along earlier today in the Old City of Jerusalem. Guys: We now have an "open source" for the best Awwama in the Old City. Awwama is an Arabic desert referred to in English as "Crisp Donut Ball" or "Honey Ball". Thanks for the best Awwama cook, 83-year old Fayeq Abu Zahra, Leaflets in Arabic with his secret recipe were being distributed in the Bazar street where his little Awwama frying place sits and was for years jamming this little alley with long queues. I remember many years ago when he would not open the door for people to watch while he was working out the dough and people in the crowd outside cracking jokes about his concern over people discoverning his secret recipe and touch. I was in complete owe today at this man's reverting intuitively back to principle of sustainable living and a commitment to circularity. BTW, I have the recipe now in my hand in Arabic and was thinking I should get it translated in case friends would be interested, if not in making Awwama, then possibly for the essence of the story.

Temperature check! Hi all, this is a little skew to many of the typical conversations here, but I'd like to invite and effort here to "think deeply about copyright".  SOPA and PIPPA have begun to push back into the spotlight some of the fundamental tensions between those forces that orbit around the old media model and those forces which orbit the new media model.  While we can quibble on the surface, the real challenge is in depth: how, as a society, should we "promote the progress of science and the useful arts" in a new media world?

As always, this is a question that requires looking at both "implementation space" (the space of all possible ways that something can actually be done, weighted by likelihood of success) and at "fundamental optimality" (based on our best understanding of how the deepest rules work and where the biggest opportunities lie).  

As a first and relatively superficial gesture, to make a distinction between:

a)  Those business entities (cf Disney, Warner, Newscorp) who due to the topography of the existing regime tend both to accumulate copyrights and to influence the existing regimes definition of copyright (and, recursively, its topography); and 

b) The people "at the edge" who actually generate creative ideas.  

Note that while Disney and Newscorp are the "offenders of the moment", it would be ideal to recognize that any given regime is likely to generate its variants and part of the challenge is to design a regime that is resistant to this kind of capture.  (i.e, lets be aware of but not myopic about the present circumstances, lets build for the long term).

And I'd like to propose a basic formula: the objective is to maximize the Production and Dissemination and Quality ideas.  Where P, D and Q are understood to frequently stand in complicated relations.  

There are questions here of network - what kind of networks lead to maximum Q and D?  Motivation - what kind of motivational approaches lead to maximum P and Q while optimizing on D? Like our work!

I just had a piece published over that the Integral Leadership Review in which I share my impressions from October's International Leadership Association Global Conference in London. 

Less a recap than a mediation, I focus on an issue that I believe will have a great deal of relevance to us here: the need to balance familiarity/coherence with diversity/dissonance in order to foster transformation within traditional systems and organizational settings. 

While most here may not be familiar with ILA, the organization has a bit from a reputation of being wary of anything deemed "cutting edge". That said, my experience at the conference was that those presentations featuring "edge-friendly" material were received with tremendous enthusiasm. So perhaps a change is afoot...

Anyway, I'd be interested in anyone's impressions of these issues and the article in general. Thanks.

That's part of what my company is doing, but also just an interesting thing to noodle around on in my head. One problem that's sticking in my head is evidenced well here:

http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/01/10/election-monitoring-in-the-drc/

This exemplifies the problems we've seen with critical infrastructure in the hands of repressive regimes. It also exemplifies the fact that the Internet has broken those regime's backs to some degree and has enabled a new way to route around idiotic blockages. 

Let's assume this scenario though:

1. Internet access is poor, filtered, monitored.
2. Phone and Mobile Phone services are fully deployed, operate very well and are semi-private companies.
3. Citizens start a movement that's based on them calling or SMSing an application to report findings. (elections?)
4. Repressive regime finds out. Blocks number that movement was using to communicate findings.
5. Movement already knew this would happen and has lined up alternative resources (phone numbers).

How does the movement communicate the new numbers to the public in an effective way so as to maximize the time they are available and minimize the risk of being found out? 

This is a general scenario. Substitute situations as appropriate, the problem still seems to persist. Anyone linked to this yet?

It’s just unbelievable… Design for Social Innovation Fellowship in Sustainability http://bit.ly/wWCahm Apply to @SVADSI by Jan 30 priority deadline ok, i'm kind of on fire this week. new conversation prompt for ya'll. http://emergentbydesign.com/2012/01/10/core-principles-for-the-new-economy-human-agency-enlightened-self-interest/ Friends, I have a question for you about how you stay on this leading edge when it comes to handling the information flow coming in to you, as a node in Indra's Net, or as an activator in the awakening of the Noosphere (Jose Arguelles, Manifesto for the Noosphere).  We all know how much information is coming in and we have all these tools to handle the intake and the filtering and the redistribution out again.  There is a toolbox of these social media tools.  But for the moment, my interest is on the level of the subtle and the causal.  Or how your intuition kicks in when you are 'surfing' the web.  How do you activate synchronicity intentionally.  Are you really being bombarded with information or are you flowing through a sea of information and your eyes are landing precisely where you need them to be.

I have called one of these phenomenon and practices in my own life - intuitive googling.  I do not let google decide for me (although after watching Eli again for the third time, I watched a wave of anger flow over me - most unusual because some things I can't control and I do SEE this when I do searches: http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html and realized wow, Google has more control than I would like).  But setting that aside for the moment because it's a different thread and topic and of course related....how do you activate your higher imaginative intuitive guidance system when receiving and sharing information.  

Thanks for any and all shadings. Wow! a really, really interesting article on the role in game design of strangers and friends and pro-social v pro-competition.  Facinating relative to the recent focus on gamification. I don't like gamification. I don't really know why yet. However, lots of gems in this one.

"There is only one class of player that is alienated by bonding oriented play: pro-dominance players that are not able or willing to play amicably with friends. This is arguably a big group (upwards of ~50% of males age 14 to 39) Yet this is distinct minority in comparison to the broader population." Collaboration request from MindTime.
I need to translate the MindTime profile's statements (how we capture information) into French and German quickly but very accurately. We have a chance to deploy the MindTime profile in Germany and France in two weeks which will allow us to scientifically validate it in both of these languages. Any thoughts or volunteers? The issue of generational change came up in another thread specifically around what are the skills (instincts, reflexes?) that the next generation will need.  It is my belief that we need to be more porous and open to our communities.  Here is a great video on vulnerability as one of those characteristics. Very bad news. http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/invincible-tb-india/ Edgers, happy new years! hope all is well, a group that my self and a few other edgers are also part of @StartingBloc is looking for a social innovation challenge sponsor.

Social entrepreneurs work for years on the world's biggest problems, sometimes with great opposition from forces of injustice, greed and an entrenched status quo that does not care about the poor and the powerless. Social entrepreneurs are not rock stars and they are not super heroes. They are more like tireless community organizers and activists who are using the market to fuel the change they seek. like.

An ecology can be defined by the following applied to living communities within a global action space:

Life processes and adaptations
The abundance and distribution of organisms
The abundance and distribution of diversity
The movement of materials, knowledge and energy
The successional development of ecosystems

This design process gives birth to a handbook that serves as a blueprint for the development of processes, methodologies, tools, material for change agents to implement to activate a greater We and nurture the emergence of a thrivable future?

We are working on it.

http://debategraph.org/Poster.aspx?aID=26&nid=120141 this came via a newsletter i'm subscribed to (http://www.in2in.org/)

In his article, "A Systemic View of Transformational Leadership", the late Russell Ackoff .... concludes, "a transformational leader is one who can formulate or facilitate the formulation of an inspiring vision of something to be sought even if it is unattainable, although it must at least be approachable without limit. The leader must also be able to encourage and facilitate (inspire) pursuit of the vision, by invoking the courage required to do so even when short-term sacrifices are required, by making that pursuit satisfying, fun as well as fulfilling." There are no rock stars and there are no super heroes in social enterprise; only people pushing the system to create the resilient world we need in order  to withstand coming shocks

am I missing something? A fine speech from Nate Garvis about how we can change the world using new tools and developed habits… As I have stated in yesterdays night conference for Edge Fund we need a platform that will gather useful “tools” for change and expose them to our communities in a “Tools Buffet for Change” additionally this platform should be able to “advertise” the selected ideas to social investors in order these tools to get financed, using existing funding mechanisms like Angelist, Symbid, Startersfund etc. thus making these ideas to be realized and finally be available in the “buffet of tools”… 

These NEW tools will help us to change the world…

Round, like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel. Never ending or beginning, on an ever spinning wheel...Windmills of your mind I just noticed something, Dinesh Tantri posted something and used the hashtag #nextedu. If you enter #nextedu into the "Search This Group" box at the top-right, you get all the posts that are tagged #nextedu. You can search any term you like, but it led me to thinking about The Next Edge..

I've noticed many different "segments" of The Next Edge, if you will, different categories of conversations.. It would be useful to use hashtags in this group, instead of doing what was proposed, and fragmenting this group into other groups of more focused "topics" or segments etc.

Why not just keep everything in this group, but create a Taxonomy with tags for different "branches" of The Next Edge? Say I write stuff about #futurestudies, I can just tag that.. if it's #graphtheory then its that etc.

Just an idea.. to make it easier to find content, that's what tags are for.. of course, you can search for and find a term without the hashtag, I just think it's a good idea to keep the tags consistent, and anyway it can easily help "export" the conversation to Twitter, Google+ or anywhere else where hashtags make a difference.. Really interesting post about the difference between what we want and what we like, and how our mind "chooses" between them. On a fascinating group wiki that explores and catalogues discussions on a host of essential issues related to rationality and cognition -- how our mind works, or rather (as I would put it) how the endless duel between our bodies and our culture plays out in our minds.

Again. I've been encouraged by Curtis Faith to repost my reply to his questions (see Jenny Ryan's thread on starving friends a little further down) in public forum, also as way of personal introduction to Venessa Miemis and the Superhero School planning people. I don't want this to be a boring resume, so forgive me if the answers are a little on the poetic side - I'll happily elaborate if needed.

What kind of work do they want to do? I want to teach (preferably related to biology), to grow things (preferably foody things), and to make things (out of fabric, wood, metal, and electronic components). 

What are their capabilities? I'm an excellent organizer, a great teacher, a meticulous maker of many things, a near-autistic genetics lab rat and plant biology researcher, an amateur oyster mushroom grower, an interactive artist, hold a B.Sc. in biology and a M.Sc. in horticulture/plant pathology.

What do they aspire to do? To live in perfect accord with my principles, and use my own life to inspire others to do the same.

What are their highest dreams? Co-creating an intentional community for the hacker/maker movement where we can actualize everything we know and believe about sustainability, self-reliance, social responsibility and individual mindful spirituality. 

Looking back at the dream my husband, myself and a small group of friends  laid out more than a year ago (https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=160103870673899&v=info), it seems like we've come to the right place. Thanks again, Jenny - you are, as always, the magic of synchronicity made flesh!

I'm not a big fan of New Year's resolutions myself, but if you're going to do them, do them right.  So for Next Edgers out there working on resolutions, here's the smart way to make them happen.  Stanford University psychologist BJ Fogg, PhD says that the most important thing in creating a new habit is to start small, in fact, go ridiculously tiny.  For instance, if you want to start flossing your teeth more, then commit to flossing one tooth a day.  There's two more steps to his research based method, which you can learn in this short article which lays out his devilishly effective formula: http://www.shareable.net/blog/go-tiny-new-year-resolutions-that-work hello everyone. I was introduced to this group by David Mcconville.. Let me kick off by sharing a thought from a retreat I was part of in Jerico earlier today. The question of what Arab Spring has been to us Arabs and what gave it the fuel to spread to the world in 2011 was at the heart of the debate. One of the reflections shared by  a "green agnostic" and which I very much relate to was that Arab Spring was almost like a new "green" religion born again out of Arabia and premised on two principles: 1. the hope of returning the relationship between the individual and the collection to a healthy sustainable state; 2. honoring nature by practicing its principles of organizing (or self-organizing if you will). I wonder what you guys think of this because it tells me this notion of a "new green religion" has bearings on the way we walk such talk.. e.g. I am now creating a crowdfunding platform which I believe needs not to only serve Arab Springs countries but also be able to soon attract creatives with sustainable designs from around the globe.. I welcome any comments you might have on the above. Also, since some of you are sustainability designers, I wonder what would attract creatives such as yourself to come to this new platform... Nice to meet you all.. Amal Alayan This group might have some interesting things to say about this. Feedback warmly welcome. What lies between order and chaos; how do you recognize a pattern?

There have been talks of creating and enabling communities of change agents -such as the Collaboratory or School or various projects suggested by Venessa Miemis. This new subgroup will focus on what such a community could do and build to unleash and snowball human agency and keep the momentum going by helping all potential change agents out there, anyone who is looking to change things, engage in transformative action, transition the organizations they are part of or create new ones. Defining how a community of change agents such as those we could create would radiate agency and change around them and beyond would provide interesting insights on how to build a strong, trustful and resilient community of change agents with distinctive offerings of tools, methodologies etc...

Since this is a thought without a firm boundary, I am posting it here on the Next Edge, which is the best place i know to try out still permeable ideas. Edges have to be about permeability, linguistic biomes, for them to remain edges, much less the next edge. Venessa Miemis I guess that's my answer. I am getting from this loose place what I want; a loose place to float new ideas. It does not divert me from doing really focused stuff in other venues. The extent to which Next Edge is always brewing but nobody ever hollers "SOUP" from the kitchen is what I want from it. There are so many new economy fronts. The more they get closer the more we will emerge together. I see the highest potential in the third world, the poor and weak from yesterday are the wealthy and strong of tomorrow together with their wider community.  i have talked about this model we can seed in rural areas and channel its effect into interdependent/independent networks. When we try to create such a structure, we will co-create the tools and processes on a practical solution can be semi-modular repeated in integrated into global incubator. 
"open-source natural building based semi-modular Eco-Village for open healing Organic-Economy". This kind of architecture should be a healing cell of an economic connected body/network. The word organic is also related to organic thinking/conception. Education to be understood as "experimental understanding" .. if we build such an open corporation/common business model of all of these cells/eco-villages, we will network a huge healing economy, ..
So u could imagine how many existing concepts could be integrated in such a big picture. Starting for providing basic needs, food, shelter, energy, to local currency of exchange, metacurrency , community building economy, .. shifting the centers of power to grassroots, .. community and swarm intelligent communication, GIS ,..  open translations tools, .. opensourceecology, 
I could link any discussion for new tools, new economies, new society, new world to this model. 
The model to provide is the eco-village estate as natural build architecture  with all tool box to start its economy and network infrastructure, which will be tailored according to existing resources, culture and needs.  
Lets talk about it Whatever there be of progress in life comes not through adaptation but through daring, through obeying the blind urge~Henry Miller

Warm regards,
Jennifer Author/Book Recommendation for TNE:

I ran a search in this group and it seems no one's ever mentioned Henry Petroski, an American engineer (+ professor & author) specializing in failure analysis.

One of my favorite books by H. Petroski is "To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design". It really changed my whole outlook not only on what Design is, but it also changed my outlook on life in general. I recommend you read any or all of his works, or works/websites about his "philosophy". Wikipedia's the simplest place to start sometimes, so here's a starter course on Henry Petroski! (Amazon seems to say he has new book called "To Forgive Design: Understanding Failure " coming out in March. Maybe get it for your Kindle?)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petroski Ok, this is very NOT "Next Edge" - perhaps actually it is the ghost of the "last edge." But I am just hoping someone in this group has an idea of where I can turn. Google has disabled one of our primary email accounts and we have no idea why. It is the account with (among other things) our shared office calendar! If anyone knows how to get hold of someone who can help, I will be seriously appreciative. Thanks, all.

Hello good people of the world. I have been challenged to kick off an Infinite Game.

In case you didn't know, there are at least two kinds of games: finite and infinite. 

A finite game is a game that has fixed rules and boundaries, that is played for the purpose of winning and thereby ending the game.

An infinite game has no fixed rules or boundaries. In an infinite game you play with the boundaries and the purpose is to continue the game.

I have been asked to do talk on How Governments Learn at Learning Without Frontiers in a couple of weeks. I'm pretty excited about it, is anyone going to be in London on the 25th of January?

Other speakers include Naom Chomsky, Conrad Wolfram, Sir Ken Livinston, Jarod Lanier and Emma Mulqueeny. Also please help spread the word, the more diverse the range of participants the better the discussion :)

When: Wednesday January 25, 2012 1:30pm - 2:15pm
Where: Salon Bourdieu (S2) LWF Festival Area, National Hall Gallery, Olympia.
How to register: It's free of charge (unlike the rest of the conference and festival), but number of places are limited. In order to attend please email me at: nadia.el-imam@coe.int What if members of Congress were seated not by party but according to their major business sponsors? I just love how this group's flavor changes all the time, as different areas of the collective brain fire up. Keeps things interesting. What are connective cues that can pull others closer?
http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/12/craft_an_attention-grabbing_me.html Iran: What are the Consequences for Banking, Insurance & Reinsurance of Conflict? We have been invited to lead a Debriefing for CEOs. Views? Sincere apologies to anyone who attended the "edge fund" hangout -- I hope the collaboration went well. As the nature of my work is mostly rooted in building social technologies (content platforms, analytics, BI, AI and the like, to include educational platforms) and less in research and strategy (as packaged sells, if you will), I would offer this in the spirit of being time-challenged: If there is an "idea" that can take shape in a fundable platform, then let's talk. Making connections and accelerating platform ideas is very much at the core of what I do. That said, I would also offer a "tip off" from several investment sources (PE, PC, etc.) who have said they are making considerable investments in the education space -- "education" meaning many things of course, but nonetheless indicative of a profound shift in thought coming from the private sector. A final note, and to echo some earlier threads I've read here, it would be great to turn the big brains of this group into big builders (talk isn't so much cheap as it is sedentary in a world greatly in need of action). I say this with the utmost respect for the knowledge domain expertise and inventiveness that resides here, just to emphasize that we need to create stronger bridges between the edges of institution, vocation and commercial innovation, and I believe this group is/could be catalytic in doing so. As for a "process", I wonder if this forum could be used to invite more people into an actionable dialogue -- entrepreneurs, investors, politicos, legislators, etc. Perhaps some might feel this would affect the purity of our intentions, but I would argue that one of our main challenges is cultivating access to the other edges, and more important, embedding perspectives we might not feel that comfortable with in order to actually affect change. Thought I would throw this out to the group... i've decided that emergentbydesign.com is ready to grow up and evolve past being my own personal sounding board to a larger blog network focused around 'the next edge,' with guest contributors and dedicated curated sections. i'm just in the process of thinking of the categories/topics, and wondering if people here have some suggestions. it's hard to narrow, but i want to get it down to probably 5 or 6 total to start. some thoughts so far: future of work, money & meaning, sex & spirit, science & consciousness, thinking tools/mindhacks, lifehacks, culture & community, energy & sustainability, dialogue & leadership, creativity & innovation, collaboration & collective intelligence, open foresight, key trends/shifts, cool tools, how-to. ok, that's much more than 5 or 6, but all areas that are important to me. general focus is how to be emergent by design - having alignment and integrity in thought/word/action, living with intention, manifesting in action, ever unfolding. would love your feedback. thanks, v another approach to action http://recoveringfed.com/2011/11/25/steve-jobs-good-or-bad-rebel/ (EVENT) SAT, Jan 14th, San Jose, CA: Community Leadership Summit West 2012

Here's a great opportunity to contribute to the future of the Occupy movement http://thefutureofoccupy.org/annotated-links/ We're working on a Common Intention Picture module in a open source platform where you can register anything such as visions, objectives, sub-objectives, activities, problems/solutions, ideas etc. With the possibility of commenting, voting, liking etc. Then we have different perspectives of searching, filtering and visualizing the information. 
Now, with the right funding it's only a matter of labour to get it up and running - it's always a matter of will, decisions and... funding. I have a very strong hunch about this that it will do the trick.. We are also working on how to make such an idea as the above real. What kind of software or implemented method can make it easier for ideas to become reality in a global community environment? How do you go from talk force to a task force? 
Did I mention I love my job? I just finished reading Tony Hodgson's new book, and am curious about when the World Game will be available as a boxed board game, as he mentions in the book. I have a group in Olympia that would love to try it. Brilliant article by Dark Mountain co-founder Paul Kingsnorth.
http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/6599/ This is maybe off-topic, but in 11 years of blogging what I consider to be extremely pertinent stuff, I've received a total of about 5 or 6 comments. Can anyone clue me in on the following: WTF how does one do it? I've read every book I could find on SEO, Content Strategy, I've read them all.. and still I have ZERO engagement. Am I seriously just that much of an ass? All my books too from the last 20+ years are on the web, on Scribd and elsewhere, and no one's ever read them I don't think. I must be doing something horribly wrong. Can anyone muster up their generosity and just give me a pointer or two? I will appreciate any help you can give. I know it's off-topic for TNE, but then it isn't. I have a theory of "obscure writers", writers that don't get a lot of eyeballs. I believe some writers are destined to be such "obscure writers". Someone finds their books on a dusty bookshelf in some old shop somewhere a hundred years after the writer's last publication.. and then another hundred years go by.. I don't want to be that writer nobody reads anymore.. I'm willing to make concessions. I'll write less if it'll get people more engaged with my writing. Any clues? I say it's not off-topic because we all have books in our collections by such authors. Those are the best ones, they are the rare finds. They are the first books we'll recommend, because we feel we have been blessed to have accidentally stumbled upon them through true serendipity. We've talked about Buckminster Fuller and I believe he is one of those writers, in part. I don't know anyone who has actually read through both volumes of Synergetics. I know I have, and I've recommended it to people, but I highly doubt very many people have taken the time to actually read it and take notes, make annotations. So what do you think? Is this post really so long to read you just skipped over it? Or did you read it and it really "did nothing for you"? I'm desperate to know, at this point, how the same strategies I use seem to work for everybody else but myself. I'm crying for help here, can't you see???! I'm at the end of my wits. I'm thinking maybe writing just isn't for me. After a few hundred thousand pages and 20+ years, no one has ever really said "I gotcha!". I have more spam robot "Friends" than actual engaged readers. What's up with that? wondering if we should form a global multistakeholder cooperative. greetings Next Edgers. I may have seen something like this here at some point.I am wanting to create a core values and skill and tool matrix for my community. can anyone recommend a simple program or software for such organizing? thank you and blessings of returning to the light. xoxox any thoughts or experience with geonet? any suggestions in practical applications? (in specific, regarding establishing core values and creating skill and materials sharing). thanks in advance. 
http://reocities.com/rainforest/andes/3262/geodemo.htm In light of present global political economic context, we intend to re-visit theoretical and practical issues concerning these ‘revolutionary’ moments and spaces by asking critical questions. What characteristics / behaviors do people evidence when they are in fear? (Trying to come up with a list - please help brainstorm) Is our deepest fear that we are inadequate or is it that we are powerful beyond measure? Is it our light or darkness that most frightens us? Is this worth noting? Paranormal: Bill Gross warns of financial market implosion and end of economic life as we know it! http://ow.ly/8i2g8 Local solutions are frequently very effective, as they reflect the needs of specific communities and engage citizens in taking action. And they are often cost-effective, since they provide a conduit for the resources of citizens, charities or social enterprises to complement those of the state. Given the growing pressure on government finances, these are important benefits.

But localism presents a dilemma. Government has traditionally found it difficult to support genuine local solutions while achieving national impact and scale. This report offers a solution: an approach by which central and local government can encourage widespread, high quality local responses to big challenges. This group is awesome, feel like visiting it more often. Cheers! I've been a bit quiet here, since I'm in Auroville - an eco-village in southern india where we are supporting a wind turbine project.  I arrived a few hours before cyclone thane, which took out thousands of trees, one every 10 meters of road; and that took out power; water; electricity; net; phone etc. Just now getting back online (occasionally).

I think Jean Russell has already posted this but I would like to reiterate a hearty welcome to all Next Edgers in Europe, to consider joining us on 14 Jan in Brussels for " #we_b ":  a cross-silo collaboration lab for accelerating social impact. We're getting responses from an incredibly inspiring and dynamic group of participants, that will inevitably contribute to shaping some collective better world building actions. Jean and I agree that if you're here in this group, you'll resonate well with what we hope will happen at #we_b. Here's your invitation: http://bit.ly/invite2we_b If there is one thing to build effectively in this group, it is a 'human agency' engine. Tools, platforms, methodologies, curricula, resource repositories, etc, etc etc... To help potential change agents engage in transformative action, transition the organizations they are part of, or create new ones. What we have to offer is some insight on what may be coming next and some experience in transitioning or implementation. We also have ideas of what tools would be needed. We can help accelerate evolution. I suggest we open a new subgroup to explore and scope this. Who would be in? How is it possible I missed this sublime ecstatic Christmas gift to the world by Jason Silva and NotThisBody? Been lurking for a week or so and loving the conversations happening in this group.

Is organized knowledge (i.e. a 'digital brain) be the 'platform' that a loosely knit group like TNE might rally around?

This IHMC research paper might point the way forward. just put together this post to review what i've accomplished in 2011 and what i plan to achieve in 2012. would love to see what other next edgers have on the docket! http://bit.ly/sBDqLY seemed like a good time to post this..

"Augmenting Society's Collective IQ 

The complexity and urgency of the problems faced by us earth-bound humans are increasing much faster than are our aggregate capabilities for understanding and coping with them. This is a very serious problem; and there are strategic actions we can take, collectively.

Consider a community's "Collective IQ" to represent its capability for dealing with complex, urgent problems – i.e., to understand them adequately, to unearth the best candidate solutions, to assess resources and operational capabilities and select appropriate solution commitments, to be effective in organizing and executing the selected approach, to monitor the progress and be able to adjust rapidly and appropriately to unforeseen complications, etc.

I contend that a strategy for "facilitating the evolution" of our organizations' Collective IQs will be the optimum approach, aka a bootstrapping strategy.

"Collective IQ" is a special set of collective capabilities, built upon our basic human capabilities, such as sensory, perceptual, cognitive, motor, etc. Any significant collective capability is achieved by "augmenting" such basic human capabilities by means of training, enculturation, etc. in operational use of: (a) appropriately coordinated systems of artifacts and tools (the "Tool System"); and (b) vocabulary, conventions, roles, organizational structures, values, rules of conduct, methods of cooperation and education, etc. (the "Human System"). Together the Tool and Human Systems comprise the "Augmentation System." The purpose of the bootstrapping strategy is to accelerate the natural co-evolution of our Tool and Human Systems toward ever-more powerful Augmentation Systems enabling increasingly effective Collective IQ.

My hypothesis is that ever-more effective "Dynamic Knowledge Repositories" (DKRs) will be central to improving a community's Collective IQ – essentially the capability, in dealing with a complex problem, for providing the best, up-to-date understanding of the current state of both the problem and of its solution efforts. Our Tool Systems would be endowed with Open Hyper Tools specifically designed to rapidly improve our collective process, and especially the ongoing organic emergence and utility of comprehensive DKRs out of that process. Specially trained teams will be involved, for instance to ingest the ongoing dialog, help in adapting to the relevant ontological shifts, help monitor and solidify the "argument structures" involved in seeking coherence and plausibility, etc. And also for providing correctly associated "views" of the knowledge structure to facilitate learning – probably different such viewing forms for different categories of learners.

Consider an "Improvement Community" (IC) as collectively engaged in improving an agreed-upon set either of individual capabilities, or of collective group capabilities – e.g. a professional society. Let's introduce a new category, a "Networked Improvement Community" (NIC): an IC that is consciously and effectively employing best-possible DKR development and usage." As Iran's currency hits a new record low to the US dollar post latest American sanctions, does this make a new conflict likely and imminent? anyone involved with or have thoughts on this organization, www.americanselect.org? "Americans Elect is a neutral, nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with any political party, ideology or candidate. It was founded by pioneers in direct technology and citizens from across the political spectrum who are worried that political divisions are keeping our nation's big problems from being solved. Americans elect is funded by individual contributions, and intends to pay back the bulk of our initial financing as more delegates join, so that no single individual will have contributed more than $10K." I will get around to summarizing my year when time stops flowing so fast around me. don't see the benefit right now. maybe i should stop and be more reflective. or maybe just read what reflective people write. curious if anyone is using http://macfreedom.com/ or any other "anti-social" software for productivity purposes? I find that I'm hugely productive/use my connections 90% of the time in positive ways, but I'm going to give this a go for deepening/writing and other creative endeavors I use my computer for. any thoughts/users? So, when are we going to start an Edge Fund? A good synthesis of a cloudy 2012 outlook. Guys, anyone know of anything similar out there? Thoughts?
I am working on a concept that combines crowdfunding with philantropy to fund social enterprises. Idea is to build a platform to support social entrepreneurs combining two elements. 1) A fund coming from family offices and corporate CSR monies that will be used to 'match' 2) Funds collected via traditional crowdfunding mechanisms. If the right level is 25% crowdfunding and 75% fund or something different is to be defined. 
I see the strength of the model in combining some of the strengths of crowdfunding (proving the entrepreneurs commitment/savvy and the engaging potential of the idea, involving the crowd) but bringing more money into the game. The corporate incentives to allocate CSR funds here would be profiling themselves to a broad range of people (via the crowdfunding element) and knowing their funds would go to projects that the crowd find engaging. 
I see potential over time to expand this to crowdsourcing (contribute something else than only money to the projects on the platform) and potentially to a KIVA-like crowd micro loan, but all that to come later. I have loads of unanswered questions and issues I see to address, but have a strong sense this could work. Inspiration comes a.o. from a state-driven Swedish platform which combines crowdfunded monies with state funds for cultural projects.
Appreciate any thoughts, am still at the very beginning of developing the concept and the thinking. Thanks! #2012 is now. Join the Secoya elders in Costa Rica and change your consciousness with two sacred medicine retreats. The jungle is calling. http://ow.ly/8fp7I What is your new year's resolution? I am looking forward to being more thankful for all that the Supra Universal Consciousness has bestowed! A structure (cooperative, collaborative ...whatever) created at the transition to the Next Edge has to necessarily have on foot on solid ground at a minimum and use some old ways while focusing on the future. However much we may dislike such old ways can we afford to have both feet in the air? This group has been doing heavy sharing on what one might call the intellectual or conceptual front. I think that a deepening of our connections could be facilitated if we were also sharing on the aesthetic plane; this seems to have worked well in strengthening the community over at spacecollective.com, to name just one example. 

In that spirit, I'd like to propose to anyone who wants to play to create an account over on the Pinterest visual curation site, which makes it ridiculously easy to share the imagery that inspires us. Some of us are already there, like Amy Kirschner and Liz McLellan, whose pinboards I have happily been stealing from ;) Just msg me your email address if you want to get in quickly (will try to send you an invite by tomorrow). a framing and a question: the next edge is a mystery school?

Superpower:?? Thoughts? "Community is woven from gifts. Unlike today's market system, whose built-in scarcity compels competition in which more for me is less for you, in a gift economy the opposite holds. Because people in gift culture pass on their surplus rather than accumulating it, your good fortune is my good fortune: more for you is more for me. Wealth circulates, gravitating toward the greatest need. In a gift community, people know that their gifts will eventually come back to them, albeit often in a new form. Such a community might be called a "circle of the gift." components of a desired 'next edge network' beyond faceook? 

http://www.cmswire.com/cms/social-business/infographic-how-much-does-design-matter-in-social-software-socbiz-012947.php Max Marmer's post on emergence is really beautiful. I have a life outside Facebook.....it's just that I've forgotten the password for it. New blog article just published I am currently involved in "next-generation" pedagogy design process — I'm looking at various evidence-based psychology, sociology, and neurology studies as a base-line for principles of evaluating various older pedagogical methods, and formulating new ones.

I don't come from academic background, and I've found that I don't approach pedagogy as academics typically do. First, I consider it a design discipline, and as User-Centric Design is my standard, Learner-Centered Design is my approach to pedagogy. Also, I see it not too much different from design the experience of a board game, or the social experience of an online game, the the craft of storytelling, or designing an emotional experience with an object such as the iPhone.

Thus I'm trying to come up with a word or phrase that is broader the pedagogy, that addresses union of all these different kinds of design of experience crafting. Any suggestions? Making 2012 A Quantum Leap Year
Dear Friends:
   
For those who've been wondering for years what 2012 will bring, here is my prediction:  You will find out over the course of the next 366 days.  Yes, once again it's a leap year and a Presidential year ... Swami's wish is that it is a precedential year and a quantum leap year.  To start the year off, join the Swami and I tomorrow, Monday, January 2nd from 8-10 a.m. PT on the Occupy Cafe.

What's the Occupy Cafe?  It's an online radio show designed to link the Occupy movement with everyone else.  Imagine 99% of Americans occupying the spiritual, political and economic conversation for a change ... for a big change.  If we want real change and not just chump change, we must activate the heart and soul of We the People -- or, as the Swami says, "100% of the 99%, and 99% of the 1%."

Steve Bhaerman What is the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit and Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad! Film maker Ian Mackenzie just released a podcast of a conversation we had. http://matadornetwork.com/bnt/occupy-movement-hacking-consciousness/

It explores some of the connections and patterns of rhizomatic organizational development and some terms like 'relational density." I thought it might be of some interest to do-beingness of The Next Edge.

Below is a written addendum that I posted to Ian's facebook comment thread to provide followers of that thread  some exploratory jump off or jump in points that might conspire with their own fetishes, passions or initiatives.

---------
I would like to give a nod to the Situationist International (SI) who were important in the 1968 wildcat general strikes/  "uprisings" in France. This apparent failed attempt to unseat the oppressive world order at the time - what they would have termed  - the society of the spectacle. I say apparent, because SI did insert their tools into our collective memory and I believe these memes conveyed by some activists and artists through time became precursors to the principles that are reflected in the anti-concept of the TAZ and phenomenon become institution that is Burningman.

Of course the history of the TAZ goes back through time and culture in the Western culture surfacing in Dionysian festivals and of course in creative tension with the ordering Appollonian forces.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian).

Perhaps Nietzche, if he were alive, would say that the same creative tensions are alive and evolving well in the Occupy movement.

In the last issue of the SI magazine they give an account of their 'uprising" and what is needed for future revolutions. SI, also states in the last line of the issue: "the SI will be superseded." They then dissolved SI.

I wonder if Occupy and its cousins will take these insights to heart and understand how to convey, continue and deepen the collective legacy beyond and within full view of the ever watchful eye that is both within our minds and out there algorhythmically cruising facebook, twitter, and our phonecalls for tidbits of information?

Some of SI's gifts that they reformulated for their time and passed forward to us include the following:

- Psychogeography,
- Dérive,
- Détournement,
- The Construction of Situations
- Work, Leisure, and Play
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International)

Village Voice writer Bryan Zimmerman noted,"One of the boldest characteristics of psychogeography may be its ability to influence and bring together all kinds of artists, social scientists, philosophers, urban provocateurs and spelunkers, and even traditional geographers, in an entirely accessible venue-public space."
(http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-05-06/news/public-notice/1/)

In 2009, the 6th annual Psy-Goe-Conflux festival (AKA Conflux) was be held at New York University in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development on September 18-20th.

In 2010, the 7th annual festival was held on October 8–10 at NYU Steinhardt’s Barney Building.

mmmm - it would seem that Conflux festival that is usually held in the fall in NYC did not happen in 2011 for some reason... or did it? ;)

Currently the top post is a youtube video - Occupy Ninjas Take Manhattan

http://youtu.be/obtiBxLAbgo

Occupy seems to be "cooking" its organizing principles and perhaps something more defined will emerge. Perhaps not. Both options are likely true. The 'essence' that sparked this global uprising is, by its nature, with great stealth, already re-formulating its next creative expression and gathering energy in our collective sub-conscious. If we were completely conscious of it then it could be mapped and its moves predicted by the industrial-technological forces that wish to mitigate its effects. If it is to remain vital like a TAZ, it must remain readying outside of our perceptual horizons and erupt spontaneously like "magic" when the system is ripe. How and where it will erupt is a matter of those who have a sense of the compass by being in communion with the livingness of the TAZ. Some eruptions may be violent. Comfort with unpredictability and willingness to stay in the unresolved state is a strategic creative advantage.  Myself, I am a proponent of the playful and non-violent, because I feel it is very hard for a industrial-technological awareness to compute the efficacy of playful non-violence. What is not known or understood, cannot be prepared for. This is the art of cognitive hacking. It is kinda Zenful ;)

In terms of exploring how to generate TAZ's and network them together - it seems that this is what we are muddling through and realizing (ie making real) as you read this and judge it worthy of incorporation into your mental workings or for the garbage heap of rejected notions. Perhaps this process of realization, like ourselves, is a work in progress. What we are exploring and evolving right now is one moment of a silver thread that runs through the space, time and consciousness of our species and each one of us. Of course the internet along with social media and hand held devices are dimensions of a medium (and the message) that facilitates the ability of people to generate and network TAZ's in new ways. In parallel there exists the age old practice  of ideas being  transported between real world sites or nodes through the creative works and minds of those who have be gifted with the experience of a TAZ and thereby enabled that which is behind and beyond the TAZ to incorporate itself into their inner compass. 

Whether it be the left bank of Paris during the turn of the 19th Century, Prague, NYC, London, Berlin, Mesopotamia, or in the digital ether - there will always be those of a certain ilk who conspire to inspire. http://www.thevenusproject.com/
No, Fresco is NOT the Zeitgeistmovement. ;) Who rejects paranormal activity altogether? Some people hear voices...Some see invisible people...Others have no imagination whatsoever...! Feeling the need to change the conversation globally. What a ridiculous notion that there is "optimism" and then "practical reality." From the article (which outlines a book I will absolutely be reading!) "But both neuroscience and social science suggest that we are more optimistic than realistic."  Really?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRtc-k6dhgs I wish a happy new year to all "Edgers" Thanks for all inspiration and inputs over the year! It has been amzaing see how this group has develop! Looking forward to meet you here in 2012!! My best, Bert-Ola An inspiring way to ring in the new year. Happy 2012 everyone! What are the lyrics as the New Year transition approaches? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? http://ow.ly/8eIye Profound insights John Thackara on the need to be cognizant of unintended consequences and awakening from the dreamtime of the industrial economy... Isolated Interaction:
Journeying the Next Edge
 
Very recently, after being in the first face-to-face conversation with a Next-(Fl)Edgling since joining the group in its relatively early stages, I realized something not entirely expected: The Next Edge experience, while many things (about which later) has also been very lonely, a story of “missingness”.
 
By lonely experience of the Next Edge I mean that it has been full of – mostly unshared and unvoiced – internal process for me. Maybe that is due to my style (an introvert who observes, feels and “mulls” over stuff, finding this a worthwhile and informative activity). And now realizing that I would like to share some of the experience – solitary reflection after a while becomes simply that: lonely, tinged with a little sadness of life not being fully expressed. Here goes …
 
What is this group or this experience? How do I find myself perceiving it (them, us)?
So far: A group process, an opportunity to observe and experience all manner of pretty wild group dynamics, an experiment, a platform to self-observe for my own reactions of agreement, irritation, boredom, resonance, stimulation, technological limitations etc.  Useful nudges, clarifications, obfuscations and some brilliant moments of inspiration, occasional affirmation and convergence.
 
A place of wonderment: Who ARE these people, and do they have a day  job, given all the writing they do here? If they do, what is it, and do they ever sleep? Who ARE these people, seeming that some know each other and share bonds from somewhere outside of this platform, there is a deeper familiarity. Who ARE these people, given that some clearly are accorded significantly higher status than others, for reasons that usually are less than transparent, at least to me. Who ARE these people, most of whom are clearly smart, and some of whom speak in dialects of thinking and slang quite seriously unfamiliar.
Technology, over wide parts of the conversation, seems to have a position of high importance, sometimes that of a savior-like capacity: If humans cannot conquer all, maybe technology can or must.
A process of figuring out how to get a word in edge-wise in the sheer quantity and speed of things – how does one interact here, anyway? What are the rules for turn-taking and contribution? Who listens to whom and why and how, and what for?
And again, who ARE these people here, what for and why? Hard to figure out in the multitude of conversations. STOP!!! I am stepping back. Disengaging becomes a survival strategy – a necessary withdrawal from overwhelm. ALL of this is just not possible. Sorry folks, I still have a day-job, tell me if you have a cool idea for a direct route on becoming independently wealthy.
Then, re-approachment, some curiosity, some longing. Selection-processes: Who would I like to have a fuller connection with? I miss the personal, the context-rich communication. I also miss the more intimate work of actually building something together, figuring out a common direction, a creation, a “forward” – a commitment to a shared journey, at least for a while. I don’t know how the transitions work here from just talking to closer bonds, to manifesting. Should I even be looking for that here?
 
What IS this, here?
 
I wonder if this the current summary of the Next Edge for me: The articulation of longing for deeper connection? Knowing now that, basically, I am not as by myself in thinking about all kinds of “stuff” as I had surmised before (for which I am very grateful), it appears that the Next Edge is making the desire for deeper connection, community and quality dialogue all the more tangible, noticeable, present.
 
I have a guest bedroom in Colorado, good access to mountain hiking and skiing, a nice back yard. Anyone care to visit? Maybe take a few days, and happen to change the world?

Holiday reading; Mass Collaboration Problem Solving: A New Approach to Wicked Problems What would you want from a 'Next Edge' network?

Hi all. I'm at Fusion right now, a futurist goal-setting and planning weekend retreat out in California. (http://www.accelerating.org/fusion/index.html). I'd love a little feedback from you.

When David Hodgson and I met earlier this year and had the conversation that led to the formation of this group, we talked about what the 'next edge' looks like, and how we can harness and direct our collective potential energy. 

It's exciting that we're at over 1,000 people here already, and it feels like a great informal learning community. 

I want to know if people see a value in taking it further, and forming some type of 'intelligent network' membership organization.

I have a lot of concepts about what this would look like and ways it would serve us, through tools we would create along the way to enable better information sharing, collaboration, knowledge mapping, and gatherings. Among other things.

I can see a lot of the ideas I have (developing Junto, the Superhero School, an event series) and that others have, being supported and accelerated if they were developed within an aligned community.

So before saying more, I just want to know, does this resonate with people from this group, and what are the types of things you would want from such a tribe? What would it have/do that would bring you value?

I appreciate any feedback.

Thanks!

What are you positive about? What concerns you? This paper shared by David McConville on another thread offers an interesting analysis of the partness/wholeness dilemma. It is quite relevant  to the discussions we are having on action platforms, ecology of transformative action. What tools, protocols, blueprints, processes, frameworks could facilitate orientation of human agency and navigation among possibilities based on needs of wholes and intentions of parts? How can we relate local/part actions to the relevant wholes? How can relevant parts be activated for the advancement of a given whole?

How do you think it relates to The Next Edge: A tiger chases a man to the edge of cliff. The man grasps a vine growing on the cliff face and climbs downward. At the bottom of the cliff, another tiger growls at the man. Two mice, one black, the other white, gnaw at the anchor point of the vine. Next to the vine, a strawberry grows. The man plucks the ripe berry and savors the flavorful juice. How sweet it tastes! reviving my transcalar imaginary curatorial site (was on twine, now on scoop.it). jump in to explore the macrocosmic and microcosmic patterns that emerge in our mesocosmic worlds... anyone involved in this? A new question this month on Evolutionary Landscapes, for anyone who might be interested in participating – Or reading along! http://evolutionarylandscapes.com/the-evolution-of-spirituality-els-january-que The article in the German "Die Zeit" is long (and google translator has its limits).
It reports on journalists living as a homeless couple and seeing what help they might get in two of the wealthiest towns (just outside of Frankfurt) of the nation. 
What captured me most, though, is a reader comment, which goes roughly like this:
"The isolation from general society of the very rich is shocking. We talk so much about the need to integrate minorities and poor people into society. But what is really needed is an integration of the alienated rich into society."  Personally, I thought this was a very inspiring frame of thinking. How could the "1%" be re-socialized into greater humanity, connection and community?  How do our actions change if we perceive with pity and compassion, rather than anger (or assigning the role of the powerful enemy)?

What are your thoughts?

http://www.zeit.de/2011/52/DOS-Maria-und-Josef Davies-Coates Why is a spiritual life key to our survival? Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life! -- Buddha http://www.the99declaration.org/has-a-harvard-professor-mapped-out-the-next-step-for-occupy-wall-street/

http://www.the99declaration.org/ is a great idea. Lawrence Lessig's new book http://twelvebooks.com/books/republic_lost.asp makes a really good basic point: that expecting congress to reform itself is like expecting a crack house to reform itself. It will never happen. Therefore, we as citizens have to *make* our government reform itself. Lessig basically calls for new constitutional conventions (I think we need them in Michigan, too). the99declaration.org is an effort to enact constitutional conventions: 

"So how do we begin a popular movement that might end with states petitioning for a convention? Lessig calls for mock conventions to happen all across the land: assemblies of regular people to think of these, and other, problems, and come up with solutions that might work. Not only would these conventions come up with a spectrum of solutions which could be evaluated and selected from, but they’d build national support for the idea that a convention like this could work." We've just published our newest issue of continent. but this article from the first issue of 2011 might be interest to some of you: "Maybe you know that cooperatives use their shared ownership structure and member fees to fund the cooperative itself. Join BALLE to learn how Co-op Power – a consumer-owned energy cooperative serving southern New England and eastern New York – is stretching the bounds of the cooperative structure and yielding amazing community capital returns in the process.

Co-op Power’s Local Organizing Councils have:

Raised more than $300,000 in member equity, $600,000 in member loans, and $850,000 in local investment to support the development of community-scale clean energy projects.

Worked together to support a growing number of new living economy enterprises, like a 3-million gallon biodiesel processing plant.

Created more than 100 jobs over just five years.

Focused on working with communities of color and limited resource communities to build a multi-class, multi-racial movement for a sustainable and just energy future.

Explore this cutting-edge use of cooperative structure for going beyond member equity to finance local businesses and create new jobs – and how you can put the cooperative model to work in your community." This has potentially massive consequences... I am feeling very pleased that Reframe It's approach called The Deliberative Corporation was named a winner of the McKinsey/Harvard Business Review Management 2.0 Challenge - "http://www.managementexchange.com/blog/announcing-winners-management-20-challenge" for the announcement and "http://www.managementexchange.com/hack/deliberative-corporation" for our entry. What do you aspire towards? Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship! - Buddha i want to start a new thread inspired by Helene Finidori's post on Jason Silva and the singularity - i see a spiritual bifurcation point in that discussion that David McConville points out - are you working towards the wellbeing of 100% of humanity or towards the increased wellbeing of the already privileged? In the world we currently find ourselves in, those two energies are increasingly moving into opposition, and I personally see the singulatarians as being on the wrong side of reality, the nihilistic, machine worshipping side of things, rather than the all-life embracing side of things, they are the sith not the jedi, the sorcerers not the shamans... as Aldo Leopold said "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." - the singulatarian memeset is wrong, and a crime against the future. If you are involved in the Occupy movement in any way, please let me know. For those that I was in conversation with and that have been wondering where I have gone... I have been fully captured by the Occupy Movment. It is the final peice of the puzzle from my transformation from a member of the 1% to a declared revolutionary!

I was first person on a mic in Vancouver at our initial Occupy Vancouver rally where there were 5000 people. I convened the General Assembly committee and lead the organization of all the initial GA's in Vancouver. I was involved on a day to basis for 40+ consencutive days including attending every single GA in Vancouver (which ended at 10pm). I have been involved in labour relations, media, communications strategy, Ten City (the encampment)... I am also a part of the InterCity Committee that is connecting the 50+ occupations across Canada....You name it. OV has had a lot of press across the occupy movement for various reasons, and I have had the opportunity to be right in the thick of things.

I have had a first hand opportunity to experience the insidious nature of the relationship between state authority and the media. Any illusions about media 'objectivity' are just that... illusions.

The 'enemy' is easier to pin down in eastern Europe and the Middle East... tyrants, dictators and so on. What is most interesting to me is that many of those revolutionaries dream of western democracy... and aspire to western ideals.

This is what makes the job for the Occupy revolutionaries that much more difficult. The power structure is more insidious and hides behind a veil of legitimacy. There are cracks in the armour, yet the target is less well defined. We are fighting an ideology that was the predominant ideologiy. It was assumed that the west was more 'right' than the rest of the world. In fighting this ideology, we continue to fight the a sense of entitlement and a sense that it is still the best way...This, in my view, is why the youth (who usually drive revolutions), have been under-represented i nthe Occupy movement. 

I currently am a convener of he Occupy Vancouver Strategy Working Group (the group that is formulating long term strategy) and the Labour Relations Working Group (I lead the conversations with union leaders... currently my plan is to figure out how to get 10,00 to a rally with their help).

I am currently also working with a group in Vancouver that is has patented intellectual property the objective of which is to optimize Large Group Decision Making models. See this video for a initial explanation: http://partyx.com/

This technology will, in time, enable us to move the GA into everyones living room... to make direct democracy a reality. We will be piloting this within Occupy Vancouver, and have already been to NY and have introduced this to the OWS Open Source Working Group.

Anyway, if you are working on anything occupy related, let me know. The edge of chaos is computationally useful. http://www.springerlink.com/content/53037104h28km70g/ “Value can be captured by leasing land for private development, by selling it, or by putting very high tax rates on the gains in the value of privately owned land but excluding the value of the structures that sit on the land.” - Paul Romer, Charter City pioneer A non profit organization has offered to let anyone use up to 50 acres of their land for any worthwhile purpose. The land is located beside a small lake near a small town in Southern India. I am aware most people here are on the other face of the planet. But just posting this offer in case someone has a plan for a warm place that is sunny all year. OCCUPY MY SOUL

The only way to describe what has happened to myself and a number of Occupy Vancouver organizers (and I suspect many other occupy organizers across the world) is to realize that we have been occupied by occupy! We have been captured and consumed by something that we don’t understand but that has served to rock our world; and that we know is something deeply important. Fortunately as we transition to Phase II (post encampment phase), we have some time to reflect.

On the surface occupy is a political movement. In actual fact it is much more... It represents the crystallization in our psyche of both a deep sense of injustice (the political aspect that is getting the headlines) as well as a deep sense of loss of meaning... in ‘ordinary’ life. Things have gone so far wrong that we don’t know what to say or do. When given the chance to register our dissatisfaction we did so without reservation and with relentless commitment and fervor. We were willing to push boundaries of all sorts.

The last couple of months has left many organizers both exhausted as well as exhilarated... unable to explain to where they have been transported. As we sit, reflect and deepen our personal dialogue, our resolve continues to deepen and take on a different tenor. We realize that this not a dress rehearsal and that the serious work begins now.

The extreme circumstances with which we have been presented (the need to defend our space, physical and psychological, from a systematic onslaught brought forth by the ‘system’), has only served to build real solidarity. True resoluteness and mutual respect is developed in the face of enemy fire. Those that have been standing 
together, in battle, have experienced something our adversaries have not. Our power is not reliant on, or reinforced by, institutional structures. We don’t have the luxury of the police force, city bylaws etc to support our strategic objectives. We don’t have the luxury of exercising power from a distance. Our power has been realized at the front line... by standing side by side with each other...

We occupy, because we chose, in particular moments, not to move. 

We occupy because this is our space and this is our time and we cannot be moved. 

We occupy because there is something deep inside that tells us to do so.

We occupy because justice is not something that is defined by the legal system. It should, if things worked properly, give rise to the legal system.  Justice flows from something higher... something deeper.

We occupy because we are a part of a larger architecture that leaves us with a sense that our actions are meaningless; that there is no way, within the ‘system’, for those without substantial material wealth to actually be heard or to meaningfully impact the ‘system’.

We occupy because we are tired of going through the motions. There is something deeply wrong with normalcy as represented by ten hour workdays for corporations that rape the planet... and where the only time for oneself and one’s family are the two meagre weeks a year of holiday these institutions choose to grant us.

Why do we serve institutions anyway? Why do abstract entities have influence at all on the time I can spend with my friends and family? What is a corporation and how did it come to control my actions... madness has ensued....

We are being robbed  of our essence, our individuality... our uniqueness... our humanity... Enough is enough! There is something deeply wrong and it is time that we, as a culture, come to realize, understand, and expose its roots. 

We want to reclaim our connection to ourselves and each other through the creation of alternative ways of being in the world. Practically this will include the creation of new forms of community that are localized and sustainable; the creation of new forms of exchange that supplant fiat currencies and all the associated baggage that comes from money (as an exchange mechanism) becoming and end in itself and the sole guiding principle for all our activity. We want to reprioritize activity, production and consumption for states of Being... supplanting states of Doing as the guiding principle of behaviour. We want the guiding principles for our activity to be love, mutual respect and care for our planet. There should not be any debate about the importance of environmental priorities. It should be self evident that without the health of the planet, human civilization is doomed. Why is this not self evident?
 
I ask this question rhetorically... We know that it is self evident, but that capitalism reinforces, by its very nature, the worst aspects of human nature; greed, avarice and self interest. Hence, the centralization of financial power, that is also intrinsic to capitalism leads to an triumvirate (corporations, the political process and the media) that serve to reinforce the existing power structure, maintaining the wealth and benefits of a few at the extent of the many...

We occupy because we have had enough... haven’t you?

In solidarity...

Occupy Vancouver Organizer It would be great to have some next edglings attend this Anyone working on new technology enabled Sustainable business models? I am looking for some and would appreciate your views/ideas. Mostly german stuff on our site but some english too. :)
https://www.facebook.com/SkyAndSandStudios By the way, the appropriate name for someone living on the edge is edgling Start off 2012 by joining Secoya elders and Reality Sandwich in the jungles of Costa Rica for two expansive plant medicine retreats. Be your change. http://ow.ly/8aDMl David McConville wrote an important message on the Buckminster Fuller Institute blog back a few weeks after Occupy Wall Street started entitled:

We are the 100%.

David uses the work being done at the Buckminster Fuller Institute as a platform for a call to action that could easily be directed at this group:

"The expanding occupations and protests around the world directed towards the global economic system testify to the prescience of Fuller’s critique concerning the lack of integrity within manufactured scarcity. The myriad of issues driving unrest reflects a rising awareness that the challenges facing humanity cannot be effectively addressed in isolation. They are in fact interconnected symptoms of a dominant socio-economic environment that is not designed to adequately support 100% of humanity."

"Fuller argued that we must begin to transform this dysfunctional system by recognizing that it confuses money with wealth. He maintained that money is 'a medium of exchange and a cash accounting system,' while wealth is the 'organized technological capability to protect, nurture, educate, and accommodate the forward days of humans' that arises from supporting the integrity of living systems. Based on his calculations of world resources, human trends and needs, he demonstrated that it would be possible to support all of humanity at a better standard of living than ever before if the production capacity and technical know-how of global society were properly applied. Instead of fighting to tear down the existing system, he sought to harness its technological and economic forces to shift “from weaponry to livingry” through the problem-solving approach he called comprehensive anticipatory design science."

and he closes with:

"The spontaneously cooperative mass uprisings currently erupting around the world are profound reminders of our species’ deeply intuitive sense of interdependence and desire for integrity. We are extremely fortunate to be part of this moment in history, but we have no time to waste by fighting the forces clinging to obsolete models of reality. Now, more than ever, people everywhere are seeking practical examples of how to make the world work for 100% of humanity. I’m deeply honored to have the opportunity to collaborate with this inspiring community to amplify and accelerate their critically important work. "

This coming year will be an important one. It could very well decide the fate of global society. Do we regress as our global civilization collapses? Or do we learn from our mistakes and design and build a world that works for 100% of humanity. This is the bright line.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJ-V5Boxz11xV3wHya8wHjyz_cYxk9XwUo4383rilpk/edit?hl=en_US cc: Seb Paquet & Helene Finidori Je voulais vous partager de quoi d'assez important.. Ce que Chris Brogan et Julien Smith ont nommés "Trust Agent" dans leur livre du même nom, c'est simple.. C'est un médiateur, c'est-à-dire c'est qqun qui "connecte" des gens avec d'autres gens.. Exemple. Si je connais qqun qui es un bon programmeur et qqun d'autre qui est excellent en affaires (en "business"), si je crois qu'il peut avoir une "plus-valeur" dans leur rencontre, c'est-à-dire, si moi j'ai le pouvoir d'introduire Monsieur X avec Madame Y et que leur rencontre - pour ces deux personnes, deux ou plus - et bien je me dois de faire l'introduction! Car si M. X et Mde. Y font une "connection", il y a la possibilité qu'ils "accroîtrent" leur biens, leur capital.. Vous voyez l'image? Je t'introduis à qqun et votre rencontre a un tel potentiel, potentiel économique, potential de capital social, capital conversationnel, capital culturel, ainsi de suite.. C'est ça la clé du concept de "Trust Agent" de C. Brogan et J. Smith.. c'est la "plus-valeur" que je peut moi-même créer.. à partir du néant.. une nouvelle valeure créée, et ça me coûte absolument rien, Zéro! Maintenant, regardons "l'effet-réseau".. Si tout le monde fait la même chose, est un "Trust Agent" et crée des rencontres qui crées de nouvelles valeures, capitals, etc.. Et bien un tout autre économie vient d'être créée.. à partir de rien, de zéro.. et on parle de milliards! Pensons à toutes les "connexions" que Chris Brogan a effectués.. il a lui-même probablement crée des milliards en capitals.. Pensons-y... que pensez-vous de tout ça? Pensons aussi à "l'Attribution"... Qui est responsable, Sébastien, de notre rencontre? C'était Daniel Durrant je crois, ou bien Zaq Mosher.. et bien reculons un petit peu.. Qui était responsable ("attribution"!) de ta rencontre avec Dan ou bien de Zaq? Reculons encore plus, et nous passions à nos ancêtres.. Mon père et ton père, ta mère et ma mère, ainsi de suite.. C'est toute l'histoire de la terre.. une rencontre après une autre.. et pensons à toute la valeure qui est ainsi créée! C'est si simple.. je n'ai qu'à observer tout les projets devant moi.. et voir QUI pourrait aider QUI.. qui a besoin de quoi.. c'est des ressources.. le web, c'est des ressources... les réseaux sociaux, c'est des ressources.. et nous autres, les "agents de confiance", nous sommes les fils conducteurs.. nous prenons les valeures, et nous construisons par dessus.. nous bâtissons qqch.. qqch d'immense, de très grand.. Donc en 2012, j'aimerai qu tout le monde fassent une chose.. Aider à faire de nouvelle rencontre qui ne seront pas possibles sans NOTRE intervention.. c'est-à-dire, en 2012, je veux faire des introductions qui seront PRODUCTIFS! Vous voyez maintenant la simplicité de l'affaire? What defines love? Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails! - The Bible : 1 Corinthians 13:4 In these times there are many initiatives but none seem to grasp what we all need - a true common vision or idea or narrative. The closest might be the idea of sustainability and the global environmental movement. But still - that's a "western" world problem.. people are still struggling getting food on the table.. and going for "consumptionism". I'd like to see a global movement that can join us all, that about participation or perhaps "wholeicipation".. I can only see one really now that would be global and that would be just and would be about love - I would call it "Made in Africa". We all come from Africa and it's our constant bad conscious. The movement would be about helping them help eachother, starting businesses, sending them stuff, raising money... ending stupid wars etc for real. I'd sign up for that. Think Kiva, think resource map... think! What product in your store would you buy - one with Made in China or the one with Made in Africa?

Any thoughts on this? What is so special about Christmas for you? For me it is about forgiveness, love, gratitude, coming together and joy! Christ inspires us all! How is a human who never get to be good?  

I think about the old Frank Capra film "It’s a Wonderful Life" to contributing to society, not just making money. 

I have listened with great benefit to Karen Armstrong, Honorary Laureate of Knowledge Prize in 2011, and her talk of compassion, knowledge and religion.

http://urplay.se/166438 Wishing you and your family love, peace and grace this Xmas. Wishing you the absolute best on this special day and a great start to the New Year!

3. search easily through the information being posted
4. understand who is who and what they do

(I've uploaded a 103MB file to ge.tt - http://ge.tt/8pDX4WB?c - that it's probably worth your while scrolling through if you can't be bothered going through the same process ... once you've scrolled through the almost 800 pages you'll understand just how much useful information has been shared and lost and discussions atrophied through the inability to more easily engage).

In short (and I know this has been raised and raised, and raised again) we need a new tool if we're going to ensure that:
1. multi-threaded conversations can reference each other
2. long discussion threads are accessible in isolation to other discussions
3. new users to the group can gain access to all conversations
4. all conversations remain live as long as they are useful - in short they can become 'present' rather than 'historical' discussions if we can more easily gain access to them

I believe that if we're going to adopt a new home it needs to meet the following criteria:
1. NOT be yet another silo (we don't need TNE to become yet another destination, it needs to be part of a larger destination - which is part of the reason it works in FB)
2. support knowledge growth, ideation and robust discussion
3. provide profiles on the various individuals, organisations and projects that are being referenced through these threads, and provide the potential for individuals and organisations being referenced to 'own' those profiles if created in their absence (we are, after all, seeking to facilitate useful connections in service to ourselves, each other and the world at large)
4. support 'value exchange' in the form of requests and offers (of human, social and intellectual capital)
5. have the ability to port data if and when it should be determined that this might be useful to further iteration
6. be supported / hosted by an organisation whose members have exhibited both action and a strong values-alignment with the aims and intentions of TNE

Greg Berry and I have offered www.w1sd0m.net as a home for TNE. It's been discussed a couple of times in previous threads and it's clearly not a simple process to shift from here to there (or to anywhere else for that matter). Aside from general agreement that there is a demonstrated need, in order to make it work the best that it could, it would require:
1. ease of access (SSO preferred, I presume)
2. the ability to share data across multiple networks (FB, Twitter, LinkedIn to name the obvious ones - bearing in mind that we only have the easy ability to share the current discussions here within FB)
3. a willingness to support the evolution of a new platform (that was developed specifically to solve many of the issues being raised in TNE)
4. design and development (specifically Drupal at this point) talent to support ongoing platform iteration

It's not a decision, but a discussion. I've asked before 'what will it take to engage?'. I'm asking again. We have a functioning prototype that places the individual at the centre of the design experience, provides useful reputation metrics and meets all of the above criteria (which are listed, not to be self-serving, but because I genuinely believe not just TNE but many other networks require a tool that meets those criteria). It's a long way from being perfect, but it's definitely a step in the right direction (and we did design it to meet the needs of a global community of values-aligned changemakers, after all ...)

Thoughts? mapping the design science ecosystem... Would it help this group if there were regular features/discussions and possibly project and people profiles? To give us an understanding of who is here? What about a mind map to see what sort of expertise interests and projects exist and to see where "synergies" (sorry, I know that word sucks" lie and what could be achieved or is it all best left to chaos? :) "The day a child realizes their parents are imperfect they become an adolescent.

http://www.chaoticripple.com/2011/strategic-frames-of-occupy-movement/ "Given how fast things move now, it's not hard to imagine that a new economic system (better design), decentralized financial wire service, or P2P manufacturing system could sweep the world in months, drawing in tens of millions of people into a ways of creating, trading, and sharing wealth." A very special sounding project... "Beginning as a single local credit clearing exchange, CES has evolved into a global network of more than 340 local exchanges distributed over 34 countries." ...
"While the CES prototype needs some refinement, it provides an operational “proof of concept” for the creation of a locally controlled, yet globally useful system of exchange that transcends the dysfunctional interest-based, debt-money system that is driving the world to destruction. " Thank you all for the joint quest, and Merry Christmas As the year finishes eating itself, i'm preparing to take a few weeks of quiet - to contemplate, reflect, re-energise and re-focus in preparation for the ensuing continuity of moments we collectively imagine as 'next year'.

Thanks to all here in TNE - the active, the passive and the space-holders, the seen, the heard and the felt - for who you are, for how you are with what you know, and for how you traverse the space between the known and the unknown with intellect, emotion and joie de vivre.

I look forward to more interaction, entanglement, challenge and delightful exploration as we continue moving from this edge to the next. It's a privilege to be in such company.

Sending love to you and yours ... This is the student site for The Magellan Courses - a curriculum of studies across domains that engage an emergent type of post-rational reasoning. What makes this type of reasoning post-rational, is that, unlike all levels of rational thinking, it does not originate from dualistic categories, but rather from onto-logical ones. The term "onto-logical" references thinking that arises whole, from the creative source of being(in-becoming), and retains the structure of dynamic wholeness, rather than being split up by the rational mind into opposite, albeit complementary, pairs. Therefore, instead of reasoning in terms of static conceptual categories, onto-logics engages dynamic properties and their relations, building systems from originary generative processes. These generative processes can be linked to the kinds of structures that arise in the conceptually dualistic, rational mind, by referencing the nature of order internal to the creative whole. The nature of order in a generative process, is never dualistic, because it itself is a living, dynamic whole system.

Magellan set out with his fleet of four, the Trinidad, Victoria, Concepcion and Santiago, to sail around the world. Although only a few of the original 247 men survived the circumnavigation, it was the first time in recorded history that humans experienced the world as a whole planet. Until the space age, all exploration of this planet was painstakingly done by moving through the terrain. We had yet to gain a vantage point from space from where we could simply observe its wholeness.Every individual perspective, from every individual hill, hillock and seaway, contributed a piece of the whole picture, and we used the stars to triangulate their relations.

This is a metaphor for the Magellan Courses. Our fleet is comprised of broad domains of special interest. And because we cannot yet completely see the kinds of new consciousness we are working from, we will need to piece together the innumerable points of reference by identifying the stars we will navigate by. For those who survive the trip, success will feel like having closed an epistemic circle, where once was a huge gap of expectancy for what is "not yet here" will be found to have been always already arising. This is the key moment of the onto-logical discovery --

We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. ~ T.S. Eliot Little Gidding

Message me if you are interested in more information! A bit of inspiration...

http://youtu.be/YZ6dNVRJEUA Is the such a thing as a personal next edge? As in, is there somewhere individuals need to get to do that the collective next edge can manifest? I don't see a lot of discussions about "personal development" here but maybe this isn't the forum for it? What do you love? I love people. Love doing things together. Love this beautiful planet. Love the light of the cosmos shining bright in all! A recent thread raised a question for me that I would like to explore more deeply with the group. "Why are we here?" 

Given that "This group was started as an experiment in curated emergence to see what value might be co-created," what is it that we see created or conveyed.... do we have a particular way of communicating amongst ourselves that does this...how "self-referential' is our discourse, and does this serve the purpose we intend? Excelent japanese analysis of how the balance sheet recession (deleveraging) may last 10 to 15 years, or even more with fiscal deficit reduction. 

"When a debt-financed bubble bursts, asset prices collapse while liabilities remain, leaving millions of private sector balance sheets underwater. In order to regain their financial health and credit ratings, households and businesses are forced to repair their balance sheets by increasing savings or paying down debt. This act of deleveraging reduces aggregate demand and throws the economy into a very special type of recession." any clue if anyone still works on this project? This is a PDF file of every discussion opened in TNE since it was formed. Every link to an external resource (not in the comments) can be copied and pasted into a browser. It's a 100MB doc, and was created as much to make a point about the richness created that we're losing access to through FB as anything.

It definitely makes for some interesting reading http://ge.tt/8cidBYB?c

It's referenced in this discussion I started about the possibility moving TNE to w1sd0m.net https://www.facebook.com/groups/120497731371323/permalink/204756609612101/ An early version of Collapse! the Game rules and outline of play is now posted on my blog:
http://howtosavetheworld.ca/2011/12/20/collapse-the-game-early-draft/ Hi, thank you Venessa and everyone for setting up this forum and for having me here.

I sit here thinking back at all those crazy ideas and the insane moments they’ve lead to as I’ve tried to pursue them. At the same time, as I go through the posts of people here, I can’t help thinking I would have been at least a tad bit saner if I had encountered a support system consisting of the resources I see in this group.

Therefore I thought I’d start by making an attempt to loosely document my understanding of the pain points of an innovator/entrepreneur and I’d appreciate if others could share their experiences too. Hopefully this will serve to derive a function all of us can provide to preserve the sanity of all the special people who love to look towards the next edge :)

So here goes. It starts with a simple idea in the middle of the night and leads to many many sleepless nights. The sequence of events emanating from that single moment seem to go something like this:

The idea
- Dreaming it.
- Brainstorming with trusted peers.
- Researching, refining, slogging and many wrong turns.
- This is fun, so glad I had this idea :)

Building it
- People - finding competent and trustworthy people with necessary expertise.
- Taking a go at it - prototyping.
- More research, refining,slogging and many more wrong turns.
- Why, oh why, was I cursed with this vision?

Commercializing it - taking idea to marketable product.
- Funding - how? who? can I trust? someone to kick me in the behind and show me if I really even need as much as I think I do to get something going.
- Save me from the sharks - legal ramifications, patents, NDAs,etc.
- Taking a go at it and many many many more wrong turns.
- Why, oh why, could I not let this vision just be?

To sum up the above, I’ve found myself always on the lookout for the following:

a) Hackers / open source evangelists to help prototype / build / test - I specify hackers or open source evangelists instead of developers because I believe it requires a special kind of person to be able to have the skill, vision and mindset to take an idea forward in it’s nascent stages.

b) Business domain experts.

c) Legal experts.

d) Finance and Funding experts - specifically someone I can trust who can point out the deficiencies in my business model or show me that I may not need as much as I think especially to build

e) Ecosystem I can trust

This last point - a trusted  ecosystem is the toughest nut to crack. After all trust is a highly personal and depends on interpersonal relations between individuals developed over time or prior experience with a group, amongst other things. Discussing your idea with a strange new group is akin to leaving your baby with a baby sitter who just walked up to your doorstep. However cracking this nut and providing a safe ecosystem consisting of each of the above kind of people could be the most valuable asset and function this group can provide to an innovator.

I’ll end this rather long post here in the hope that in the least this would give enough food for thought and others will rip this apart and come up with something truly beautiful :)

Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone :)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG0mUwIpy2Q&feature=youtu.be MMXII, heruka and heyoka style... Same for you? Just 3 postings can be seen!! The Next Edge's Max Marmer has a very interesting blog post today, Mapmakers, Toolmakers and Complex Development Systems. A key paragraph states:

"I think it’s generally pretty futile to try to convince more people to think like you and care about the things you do. At least it’s a very slow process that is usually not the best option to achieve the desired objective. It’s better to try to find and gather all the people who already have a similar value system to you. Rather than trying to convince people to start thinking holistically in systems, Turquoise mapmakers need to take the world’s fate into their own hands, build a team with a number of toolmakers and start creating the future they are spending all their time thinking about. At least that’s what I’m doing and what I concluded makes sense after studying enough maps."

Good advice for us Next Edgers. And a beautiful video besides.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=rIOe_zLrpwo nice blog from Max Marmer Fascinating stuff here, folks. I want to read all of it, follow every link, but fear that will eat all my time every day. How do you all do it? Quick question, if someone was to propose to you that they were working on a "monadological" computing platform or idiom, would that be meaningful or meaningless to you? If meaningless, would it be evocative enough to want to learn more, or would it seem like the arrogant puffery of someone desperate to attract attention to their own intellectual posturing?

My friends and I are working on an idea for information management that permits flexible recombination of information points without explicit linking. The idea is that each information point knows where it is in a coordinate space, and queries pull views together by delineating a region of that space. So each info point knows where it is in the "universe", even as that info universe is expanding. This might result in two things being "linked" (often retrieved and arrayed together) as proximal on the platform, even if the people who entered them into the system did not know they were related.

Thus, like in Leibniz's Monadology (http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm), each info point is the sum total of its relative position against every other info point in the system. That relative position is its "representation" or "perception" of place in the universe. Relevant sections from Leibniz's Monadology include:

----------------

56. Now this connexion or adaptation of all created things to each and of each to all, means that each simple substance has relations which express all the others, and, consequently, that it is a perpetual living mirror of the universe.

57. And as the same town, looked at from various sides, appears quite different and becomes as it were numerous in aspects [perspectivement]; even so, as a result of the infinite number of simple substances, it is as if there were so many different universes, which, nevertheless are nothing but aspects [perspectives] of a single universe, according to the special point of view of each Monad. (Theod. 147.)

62. Thus, although each created Monad represents the whole universe, it represents more distinctly the body which specially pertains to it, and of which it is the entelechy; and as this body expresses the whole universe through the connexion of all matter in the plenum, the soul also represents the whole universe in representing this body, which belongs to it in a special way.

----------------

I have been thinking about this way of expressing what I think is an important general computing idea - an evolution of the representation of relatedness that goes beyond the graph as our model for a connectome. But I hardly ever invoke the "monad" metaphor for it because I feared it would sound pretentious and simply muddy the waters. However, I recently had the privilege of discussing these ideas with Jordan Greenhall on a trip to California, and he noted the monadological structure of what we were proposing pretty quickly, without anyone having primed the notion for him first. This has emboldened a hope in me that maybe I can go ahead and start framing what we are doing as "monadological information processing" or "monad computing", or something like that. Just before the Contact conference this past October, I decided to spend the night in the Occupy camp. I didn't have any camping gear, and they didn't allow tents. So I spent the night under a blue plastic tarp with a blanket wrapped around me.

It turns out, I picked the fall's first big night of rain and cold snap. It got down to the mid 40s with very cold rain. A storm's worth, not just a small shower. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was soaked and cold the next morning. So the nearby McDonald's was packed with people hoping to warm up and dry out.

I bought a coffee and sat down at a table next to a small group who were talking about Occupy strategy. After a bit, I started a conversation with one of the occupiers, Brian Pierce. Brian struck me as very sharp and energetic and anxious to do his part. He had some blog posts on strategy and a site he showed me. Well, it turns out he and some friends have been very busy.

Recently Brian informed me that a group of the NYC Occupy people have a new web site up: Occupy Educated. They want suggestions and help.

What say ye? What do you think of this new site?

http://occupyeducated.org/

Brian is first to appear (about 0:13 in) on the introduction video, but it is very likely you will recognize some of the other people from other viral videos that have made the rounds. http://connectingpeoplestudy.wordpress.com/

Maybe someone are interested in this research? What helps on the path? The idea of how everything is interconnected and the impermanence of things sums up the web of life for you and me! Per Michael P. Gusek's post on Cowbird, thought I would share this on short and long context. 

https://plus.google.com/u/0/102664611084575953975/posts/emeNYPadm3H "To combine economic growth and a pleasant environment, society needs to scale back its resource use and the ensuing pressures on the environment, by a factor of five. The challenge is to do more with less; something for which there is no instant solution. Innovation will be required and may be stimulated by a government that sets clear objectives. This involves a number of key elements, such as promoting a motivating perspective that would stimulate people, introducing dynamic regulations that reward innovation and remove restrictive rules, and being open to learning from society." http://savageminds.org/2011/12/20/hackers-hippies-and-the-techno-spiritualities-of-silicon-valley/ INCREDIBLE NEWS:

I'm wondering what would happen if this group of inspiring future-oriented thinkers and organizers started creating a more sustainable community together. I don't mean moving in together, necessarily, but certainly to work on what we actually can do for each other. As opposed to talking about what we're going to do out in the world. I'm not saying we're not working together, we certainly are. But we're not very much working together in the sense of actually depending on each other.

If this were an Occupy camp, some of us would be manning the kitchen. There would be a medical tent, staffed by some of us who have the required skills. There would be a conflict resolution section over there. There'd be workgroups for infrastructure, communication, etc. Every day a bunch of us would annonce trainings in a variety of survival skills we need. If we needed something, there'd be a good chance that it already had been organized.

Again, I'm not saying we're not doing anything, and that we don't have workgroups. But it is a good deal more theoretical than it would be if it somehow really counted. No insult meant to anybody. I just can't help but wonder whether it would be more useful if we got really concrete about what each of us can do for each other, or what we in small groups can do for the whole here. I.e. a more internal focus than what we seem to have at the moment. Like, if I personally had to look at what I could be available for in this group, which would be useful and valuable, it would probably have to be something a good deal more tangible than to provide good ideas and add comments and likes to other people's posts. Not that there's anything wrong with good ideas and constructive comments. Hmm... maybe we could create a permanent hangout for the Next Edge? A water cooler that keeps on giving... a question: has anything happened in your life this year because of the existence of the Next Edge? hello world In both the United States and  many other countries, students are protesting against rising tuition fees, the increasing financial burdens they are forced to assume, and the primacy of market models in shaping higher education while emphasizing private benefits to individuals and the economy.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/siliconangle/2011/12/09/twitter-users-getting-blocked-in-droves-as-new-update-limits-go-into-effect/ last week, a few Next Edgers gathered in mill valley, CA to get into action-orientation around creating the future.

here's a brief review of our format!

i have seen threads of events/gatherings forming in different cities. if you want feedback on running a fusion, let us know! 

http://emergentbydesign.com/2011/12/19/facilitating-trust-capacity-building-in-21st-century-organizations/ It's official: Theres' definitely a "The 1Percent vs The 99Percent" plot element to the new Batman movie.  Fascinating! OWS! If you saw "The Men Who Stare at Goats"... Every time you click this link, it generates a new insurrectionary manifesto. The Future We Deserve http://thefuturewedeserve.com is now in print. We have a PROOF copy you can buy (or download the free PDF) for copyediting purposes as we work on it over the holidays, and the FINAL book with be launched in January. It's really good to see it finally in print, even the galleys! We're going to do another one right after the first one, now that we've got the production process sorted out, so be prepared for THE FUTURE WE DESERVE 2012 coming right up. Get thinking. Writing early next year! Mebbe we should do a TNE book this way? http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-unleashed-mind The rise of soft power http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/16/germanys-hundred-year-war/ & http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/16/hong-kongs-economic-magic/ always good to hear mr Goldsmith talk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rfb2sR1qzU&feature=relmfu hello everyone! my friend Nova Spivack has just launched Bottlenose (http://bottlenose.com/), the "smartest social media dashboard" and created an invite code for Next Edgers. the first 200 people to use the code "nextedge" get to play! thanks again, nova :) Marcin is unbelievably badass. I am going to try something new here in TNE, and suggest "causes that we can connect with". These are just suggestions, and hopefully it will prompt others to do the same. 

The goal in throwing out suggestions is to get those of us who care or are willing to start thinking about how our innovative, emerging-systems approaches and thinking might benefit people who are really suffering right now. If there is a will to help these people, I think there is a possibility to connect us from here in this group to their physical reality in ways that will have an impact, if people in need are receptive (and if what we offer can help them).

So, one suggestion comes from a link Suresh Fernando posted recently, talking about the problems that Attawapiskat in Canada are facing. What if there was just one fairly simple, but really effective and high impact thing we, TNE, could do to help people like this every few months? (even just one thing every 6 months for instance). What do you all think?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/canada-third-world-first-nation-attawapiskat?fb=native&CMP=FBCNETTXT9038 Hakim Bey getting (back) into the act.  The tone is starting to come together.  Its a matter of "sideloading" a voluntary 'opt-in' alternative economy/polity that operates according to a new set of rules.  I disagree with his take on "alternative currency", but that's OK - Bey isn't up to the cutting Next Edge on that one.

I also think that folks need to start understanding the role of the Internet in all of this.  As just one example: imagine how long it will take small farms and community banks to get 800 million active members?  Facebook just cracked 800 million and they got to 100 million in 4 years.  Network effects can drive truly massive adoption of new core functions (finance, education, science-including journalism, politics, jurisprudence) *quickly*.  Much too quickly for the legacy institutions to be able to respond to effectively. Has someone attended this forum? http://bilderbergmeetings.org/conferences-10s.html Wheatley on life: Do you think @HugTrain is an edge-y project? Bill Hicks would have been 50 years old today. The outlook on life he shares here is priceless... and he ends by, of all things, summing up Bucky Fuller's core philosophy! Enjoy! I thought at first that this was OT for TNE, but now I'm not so sure. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I find this deeply troubling. If the ACLU and commenters are even half-right, we may be looking at a militarized US (including Canada thanks to Harper) society, where all acts of non-conformity will be brutally repressed and people will be afraid to organize or act in any coordinated way not sanctioned by the government. If so, this completely changes the way in which TNE will have to evolve. Tell me I'm just paranoid?:
http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2011/12/15 Here is an inspirational interview of Jason Silva on singularity that raises interesting metaphysical question: immortality, humans turning into gods, transcending our animal condition. What is humanness in the context of singularity and do we retain it? What should humans retain from their animality? What is the role of ethics in this context? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=vsuuJ7pa_D0 New York City or area Next Edge Meetup sometime next week anyone?

Trying to figure out who here is near NYC. And perhaps get together to discuss the Edge Camp idea. See: https://www.facebook.com/groups/120497731371323/200757466678682/ The MetaCurrency Project is chock full of good stuff.  I really like what Art Brock  and Eric Harris-Brown have developed  (I'm aiming to help out with the Clojure codebase of their streamscapes). I'm watching the 'program' that is being fed to our children - shoot, kill, crush, destroy - for all ages, rated G. WHY??

Can't WE do better than this? please, WE need to support the young ones onto a path of human respect, self respect, respect for life...
 
How are WE going to do this? "We might summarize our present human situation by the simple statement: 

In the 20th century the glory of the human has become the desolation of the Earth, and now the desolation of the Earth is becoming the destiny of the human. From here on, the primary judgment of all human institutions, professions, programs, and activities will be determined by the extent to which they inhibit, ignore, or foster a mutually enhancing human - Earth relationship." Future Work Skills 2020 - Sense-making, Design Mind, Novel & Adaptive  Thinking, Social IQ, Virtual Collaboration, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy... http://apolloresearchinstitute.com/research-studies/workforce-preparedness/future-work-skills-2020 (thanks for link David Hood) Big News: In this interview with an expert on the unintended consequences of GMO crops, we hear about effects on fertility (animals and humans) and other big dangers. Well worth watching this 1-hr long discussion. (By the way, the expert obviously uses Systems Thinking.) Prediction: in early 2012 hundreds of people will come to experience an enlightenment of sorts; a moment of exquisite awareness, a flash of clarity... where they realize they all have the SAME FRIGGIN' IDEA. Further, they will decide that this idea is *so huge and important* that they cannot possibly carry it alone, or even with a small team, and that they will get their shift together and work with one another rather than separately on bringing it into existence. compare and contrast with other approaches (the Human Project, the Singularity, Transhumanism) Just to forget for a moment the bad news and keep on. Not sure if sure, but this Fulford fella seems like he has pretty legitimate credentials... and uh...  wow.  If you read/listen to the full interview, keep an open mind.  Truly boggling claims.  I guess only time will tell if it's true or not, but if these next few months start getting really crazy and the disinformation ramps up more than usual... the US' SOPA and the new NDAA would be/would have been powerful weapons.

And on the bright side, the kind of world that Fulford talks about -- that apparently, this well-connected group of people with 85% of the world's actual wealth want to see -- sounds incredibly aligned with the vision a lot of us here seem to see.  Regardless of how the future is going to turn out, I'm looking forward to participating in it.  Have a great one, everyone! Hey Everyone - I've been very 'occupied' for the last couple of months so have had no tme to follow NE activity. I am curious as to whether any collaborative activity has emerged from this space. Have any projects that people are working on emerged from here such that the project formed in this context? I am aware of the NE blog that has recently got off the gound. I've been reading Taleb's book, The Black Swan, and it got me thinking about how to deal with our internal blind spots...

SHARE: https://www.facebook.com/events/198254403541920/ My own working assumption of why we are here is that we are here as
local-Universe information-gatherers and that we are given access to the
divine design principles so that we can therefrom objectively invent
instruments and tools -- e.g., the microscope and the telescope --
with which to extend all sensorial inquiring regarding the rest of
the to-the-naked-eye-invisible, micro-macro Universe, because human
beings, tiny though we are, are here for all the local-Universe
information-harvesting and cosmic-principle-discovering, objective
tool-inventing, and local-environment-controlling as local Universe
problem-solvers in support of the integrity of eternally regenerative
Universe.

And if you cannot attend, support them here: http://www.indiegogo.com/katalysis I wrote this piece recently, and yet haven't had much feedback on it ... perhaps because so many of my networks are north american ... curious to know what we collectively think about this, and what possibilities there are for resolving what i - and many in my non north-american networks - see as being a fairly significant issue; i don't have an answer, just a burning question! https://n-1.cc/pg/groups/1031806/wwwcaloomcom/
" Caloom is a geo-resilience project. It is loosely similar to Asset Based Community Development in goals .." via Darren.
The first question had is How to manage that people in the same geo-radius would not create many calooms?

the point I have on the many tools any one can install and start using is that, they mostly lack on democratic startup process of local community.
There must be regulations and conditions so that the tools serve their purpose.
So I think for locality eco-geogical tools there could be a facilitator guided process wizzard guiding the initiators through a maturity process of using and benfeting from the tool. 

Measures like
1. initiator to complete studing the tool
2. to present the tool into their radius and define registration and landing procedures 
3. to define decision making process 
..
.

intersection scenarios to be discussed in the design for the case some neighborhood regions are overlapped. Their must be an "interface" design for this case where both communities exchange data and build decisions 

am not code developer but i am ready to help in any discussion about new designs in this sector. An exchange with Daniel Durrant on power and intelligence reminded me of what MLK shared in one of his memorable speeches:
"Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at it's best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at it's best is power correcting everything that stands against love." Interesting new candidate for the Reform Party nomination.

I had a few long conversations with Robert in May/June timeframe. My intuition says he's a good hearted guy and he's smart as hell and a charismatic speaker. Listen to his ideas about the platform and putting the American People in charge of the government. He's saying the right things and I believe he means them based on my personal contact with him.

Haven't known him long enough to feel comfortable putting him in this group yet, but he's on my list for the future.

Jordan Greenhall He'd be completely up for listening to crowd-sourced advisors and platform, he as much as says so in the brief video on the linked page. Could be a way to jumpstart the New Party using the Reform Party's existing party and ballot infrastructure.

Could easily get into a kingmaker position to drive a bottom-up change initiative with one of the major candidates even in a worse-case scenario if he gets the Reform Party nomination. Hi, does anyone have recommendations for great writers/thinkers who have recently published articles about democracy - especially those addressing issues of holistic approaches to governance, collective decision-making and true leadership? Thanks! looks like the world economic forum is starting to see things from a slightly different perspective.. No idea what this is but thanks for linking to me in your post (I think) Talking about creating participatory experiences which enable, uplift and inspire - this could be a partial offering of that nature.http://www.bigpicturesmallworld.com/ Excellent article by Clay Forsberg on living with disruptive uncertainty. For the past 5 years, I worked on "hard" AI: developing algorithms inspired by the Brain and formulating foundations towards a mathematically rigorous theory of Intelligence. I've also spent a few years doing basic neuroscience and machine learning. I am about to graduate and I want to tell the world about my experiences! Maybe I'll write a book, but for now I'll give everyone here a chance to ask me anything! 
To start this off, maybe you can say what you think will be the role and capabilities of AI in the next: 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? This will help me understanding where you are at! I came across this article on Robert David Steele's website. 
A review of the book Evolutionary Activism by Tom Atlee 
"Evolutionary dynamics includes “the idea that evolution is about diverse entities interacting in nurturing and challenging contexts to create and sustain new forms of elegantly simple complexity.” (with credit to Peggy Holman)
Quite relevant to our discussions here. And views not only shared by hard core integralists :)
http://www.phibetaiota.net/2010/01/coming-soon-evolutionary-activism-by-tom-atlee/ i wrote a new post about the importance of storytelling today, and as jonah sachs puts it, filling the myth gap Hey gang, my book, Creating TIme, on our 15 year lab experience with self-organized (yes, really self-organized) teams and the universal tools they use to deliver great products on time every time is available in paper now from my website www.simplerulesandtools.com or from Amazon by Dec 19, or Kindle mid-Jan.

How do we bring together teams of both types so they benefit from institutional support / resource and external free-thinking and entrepreneurial drive? How do we build the trust and business models to make it safe, integral and workable? How to we get these groups coalescing around purpose-driven projects focused on scaleable outcomes and impact? How do we attract the Proof of Concept funding or investment to ignite this potential? "the differences between network-centric and hierarchy-centric thinking, called Network Thinking:
   Adaptability instead of control

Metaphor Theories: http://www.textetc.com/theory/metaphor.html

Excelent post regarding language:http://spacecollective.org/Xaos/7203/The-Aesthetic-Ground-part-2 simple, yet nonetheless great list of reminders: http://www.marcandangel.com/2011/12/11/30-things-to-stop-doing-to-yourself/ Cynthia La Grou Dylan Hendricks Jordan Grader - have we kicked off a Next Edge subgroup for the new meta narrative? This phenomenon has been fascinating me. Would love thoughts / comments. (And I hope this is in keeping with the purpose of this group. If not, as a newbie, please forgive and please let me know.) http://emergentbydesign.com/2011/12/10/essential-skills-for-21st-century-survival-part-6-storytelling/ Another ....book to look at and collectively decide it fits our scope or creeps it out. Seb asked me today what I thought of this group and I laughed and said something like "wonderful but suffering from infinite scope creep..." “Who is in charge here?” 
“Everyone.”
“What are you in charge of?”
“Everything.”
“Do you have a title?”
“Yes.”
“What is it?”
“God.” SAN FRANCISCO - I will be in SF this week. Hoping to do a meetup of thrivable folks the 15th - Thursday evening - at 6:30pm in downtown. Will you join us? We usually do the Press Club, but I am interested in something else this time. Suggestions? Interesting take on Innovation as it related to board game design, I also believe it has some implications for consuming something "new".

http://www.bgdf.com/node/5722 I'm not sure if the particular context of this will resonate with the group, but I do think it's essentially right that face to face meetings especially with a group keep us more human (in the larger sense of the word.) Report - serious reflection on the nature of progress and immediate concerns: Climate change, fuel security, collapsing biodiversity and global inequality, that have moved inexorably to the forefront of the international policy agenda over the last decade. Issues that can no longer be relegated to the next generation or the next electoral cycle. They demand attention now. change agents and class....
Thinking about Vinay's post and my reaction to it. I know one of the reasons I don't talk about how I intentionally scaled down my life and income to do the work I want to do in the way I want to do it is because it screams class and privilege to me. I am, after all, a well-educated, middle class white girl with choices. 

There is a risk, when you don't have family and friends who are playing in capitalism, to play outside of wealth bondage (as Phil would say). I was never taking that risk. I am lucky. Damn lucky. There are so many brave folks I see around me who risk more than I do fighting for the world we want, and living on more than one edge.

Maybe we should talk about it openly? How do we each manage to operate on the edge? A spouse or partner who supports you? Family? Previous work/earnings? Network support and gift economy? Viable sale of next edge products/services? Split life between edge and center? Was it by choice,  like mine was? Or was it the only option that could work? Other? 

Even if you can't say in public, I invite you to gratitude for what has gotten you this far along the path. And congratulate you on your bravery on getting here. Thanks. This above all: to thine ownself be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man! -- Shakespeare http://www.groundswell-movement.org/the-vision/#.TubmouSbZV8.twitter By the way I do linguistics and NLP

Two interesting links regarding storytelling check: Anni Roolf, Wilma Schrader

Telling stories: http://bit.ly/pFoO0V

computational poetry: http://bit.ly/pFoO0V Has this been talked about here before? "Personally tailored" searches is infecting news sites, leaving people critically uninformed. Big problem. How do we fix this? Wanted to make a clear point here (in response to Nadia EL-Imam's comment somewhere about w1sd0m having an association with Intel) that we don't. In fact (to quote Greg Berry) "we were formed in, by and for the collective. We have walked away from partnership discussions with others in the #impactinvesting field because they were too single-bottom-line oriented."

That being said, it does raise an interesting point, specifically:

Under what circumstances is it necessary / effective / in integrity for a changemaking organisation to take funds from an organisation such as Intel?

I feel as if we are often hamstrung by our own philosophy, rather than recognising that we need to be pragmatic idealists - as focused on remaining in-line with core values, while simultaneously getting things done with the resources we have available to us.

Would love to see some discussion around this as, quite frankly, bootstrapping is fun and all, but if we can't permit ourselves to take money from a company such as Intel - we're our espoused values and our values in action are clearly at variance - aren't we just allowing our intelligence to make idiots of us while simultaneously permitting the suffering we're seeking to mitigate to continue unabated? The latest news from TED founder Richard Saul Wurman...

http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=73071dbfc402eb720a69e2320&id=288e1ef5cd&e=7b456c9a85 More interesting stuff on rhizomes (this time in education) and other good content from a new twitter discovery, david cormier http://davecormier.com/edblog/ I'd love to have him on here so will seek him out and invite. 

ALSO, in the interest of sharing, and given that it's where I found Dave, would love to know people's thoughts on twitter university/ies, as I've only just discovered this one: http://svtwuni.wordpress.com/the-concept/ 
they're welcoming people to do segments, has anyone done one/does anyone want a go? also: love this. you should see it, it's a hopeful moment. the more people in more industries feel brave enough to do the same, the more potential there is for change across the board/seeming 'boundaries' : http://cleanandsafeports.org/blog/2011/12/12/an-open-letter-from-america%E2%80%99s-port-truck-drivers-on-occupy-the-ports/ Curtis Faith shared with us a very interesting piece from Seb Paquet's Emergent Cities series, in relation to a side discussion I had with Sabine Amend, on the fact we were "seeing experienced managers in business wanting to leave or leaving corporations, and not just a few. "

In particular, Curtis pointed out to Seb's notion of hollowing: 

"The Hollowing is about people sensing something wrong and jumping ship as the existing paradigms don't fit the needs."

http://emergentcities.sebpaquet.net/how-social-movements-happen-part-ii-hollowing

I would like to discuss this notion of hollowing and jumping ships and explore how old institutions or at least the way the mainstream operates could be regenerated by their people from the bottom up. Because not everyone is a good swimmer, not everyone is configured to fully take charge of himself. The current crisis and the phenomenon of hollowing that we did observe during the dot com bubble is having a detrimental effect on already hit parts of society. Do we really want to see our institutions become like ghost towns? How can these institutions morph into something more thrivable. Because eventually, there won't be enough room in the small security boats others are building and we should probably try and avoid too many people going down with the ships…

Not all is evil and inefficient in the central world... There are pockets of willingness to move things that need to be empowered. Think of getting conversations going at the water cooler and coffee machines on how institutions could create 'real' value for humanity... What would be the few simple switches or leverage points that could be politically pressured OWS style to push the paradigm out rather than leaving the ship? 

I for example am thinking of accounting for externalities even through virtual third party reverse "window dressing"... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9xbtd21X1Y

And, just as importantly, you need to figure out how to communicate what you're doing—systematically and across platforms. Really like the visual story telling and the ideas expressed here: The implications of new research are particularly relevant for organizational leaders. It is now clear that human behavior in organizations doesn’t work the way many executives think it does. That in turn helps explain why many leadership efforts and organizational change initiatives fall flat. Leaders who understand the recent breakthroughs in cognitive science can lead and influence mindful change.

http://cowbird.com/ this morning i was reading the latest blog up at the Automatic Earth, thinking about the collapse of the current financial system, and pondering what is a transformative innovation of our financial system? This lead me to think about the trustnet work going on over in the Hackacademy - and the idea of social capital embedded in a network more generally.  

If all money became worthless tomorrow, what would enable people to get things done? 

Trust.

One interesting framing, I think, for a structured trust net is as a bank of social capital. It is a store of recognized value created for the network. Forever grateful, forever happy, forever serene, in the knowledge that whatever is unfolding follows a pathway leading to greater involution! Amazing accomplishments!

http://www.sparksummit.com/2011/12/09/these-extreme-women-are-where-its-at/ Dear extraordinarily interesting folks who happen to hike and are in SF this week,David Hodgson and Bobby Fishkin are going on a hike to the next level up on Friday December 16th. We will meet at http://www.yelp.com/biz/sutro-baths-san-francisco which will give us more flexibility for a winter timing. We will meet at 3:45pm.  Feel free to RSVP so that we know to look out for you when we're there and avoid leaving anyone behind. I've added some folks to this email whom I think would enjoy conversations envisioning paths to better worlds. Cheers,

p.s. You can see a google group here listing future hikes (http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level). Great talk on how to craft compelling modern myths that inspire social change. Curtis Faith: "the kind of movement we need is not one that will be based around any particular person". I can buy this. No messiah - or all messiahs, depending on how you look at it. 

Next question: does the movement need a name? Or must it actually not have one? "The looming fear whose name political leaders dare not speak is global depression, but that is not what we're in for. The term suggests a temporary sidetrack from the smooth operation of integrated advanced economies. We're heading into something quite different, a permanent departure from the standard conception of economic progress, the one in which there is always sure to be more comfort and convenience for everybody, the economy of automatic goodies." Hi, all. Reorganizing my blog, and realized I haven't ever put this up.  The actual talk title is "Measuring Meaning" Many thanks to Bill Bellows for surfacing this cool paper elsewhere, "Systems & Design Thinking: A Conceptual Framework for Their Integration" from John Pourdehnad and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania http://repository.upenn.edu/od_working_papers/10/ The authorities are learning. Wondering whether copies of "Ready for Anything" can be ordered from the U.S. rather than the IFF web site. Here's the OpEd piece I wrote about Occupy and comparing the body politic to a dysfunctional family. This is the CEO who said, "if I'm not called an idiot at least once a day then something's wrong." An idea: a governance compass. We mix the Political Compass (google it) with the Geek code (http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html). 

You answer a series of yes/no/both questions (e.g., top-down or bottom-up?) and you get a standardized psycho-DNA encoding of your governance profile. This makes it easy to match people who love the same governance mode.  (http://movecommons.org/ goes in that direction.) Maybe Complex Networks is not your bag, you might still want to take a gander at Albert-László Barabási. Decision-based queuing processes, the idea of tasks executed based on perceived priority, a consequence of which is the bursts and heavy tails characteristic of human behavior / human dynamics, I find that rather interesting. Check him out: cc Daniel Durrant cc Dan Robles cc Seb Paquet : The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/200505-12_Nature-HumanDynamic/200505-12_Nature-HumanDynamic.pdf Anyone know where to find an updated calendar of top conferences (TED, Davos, CGI, Bilderberg, etc.)? "Top" at least in the sense of perceived or associated level of prominence. found via Alexander Laszlo
""The very aim of our society seems to be to remove from people responsibility for their lives and acts. The way of transformation must be the exact opposite of this. Whatever else it may lead to, it must make us into free, responsible individuals, able to direct our own lives in accordance with the greatest objective good." -- J. G. Bennett, Transformation found via Giorgio - obviously :) Thought this quote was fitting for this group. "There is an almost sensual longing for communion with others who have a larger vision. The immense fulfillment of the friendships between those engaged in furthering the evolution of consciousness has a quality almost impossible to describe." ~ Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Does anyone know JP Rangaswamy of Confused of Calcutta or @jobsworth on Twitter? This article today on what it means to be Maker Friendly is outstanding.

He articulates something that's been on many of our minds for years. We need maker-friendly cars, for one. And computers... And we need to come up with some way of knowing what is Maker Friendly and what is *not*. greetings, i come in peace :) Big News: Russian television has changed how it is covering the unrest in the country. Real, factual coverage is being offered now!

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/world/europe/russian-tv-changing-its-strategy-shows-protests.html Following up on Seb Paquet's question of name or no name for a possible meta-movement. Markus Ode Slobo Loponen suggested WE MOVE with the following rationale: 

"I vote for "WE MOVE". Long live the greatest common denominators! Now, what movement exactly are we talking about? Or is it the famous "movement in general" that doggedly evades exact definition, but we all know it's happening? :)

If we can identify 1) prime movement unity and 2) prime directions/dynamics, we can derive a nominal series of sub-movements in the "WE MOVE _____" namespace (@ Above/Below, Outside/Inside, South/East/West/North, etc.)."

Thoughts? Greetings!

The ATCA Research and Analysis Wing (A-RAW) and the mi2g Intelligence Unit (mIU) have been working on this ATCA 5000 briefing, “Nascent Observations:  European Fiscal Compact” We would welcome your input in regard to draft 32 prior to official release before the Japanese markets open on Monday.

Thank you

Nascent Observations:  European Fiscal Compact Draft 32

1.  Until the fog clears in regard to the European fiscal compact, it is difficult to say anything which is analytically sound.

2.  When Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China between 1949 and 1976, was asked for his assessment of the 1789 French Revolution, he said, "It is too early to say!" 

3.  Taking inspiration from Zhou Enlai, we are for the moment, continuing to attempt to make sense of what has actually been achieved to resolve the Eurozone crisis. 

4.  The fiscal compact leaves many important questions unanswered and the devil lies in both the detail and the mechanisms utilised for implementation -- not broad markers in the sand at a grand summit where petulant leaders refuse to shake hands with those who question the merit of their proposals.

5.  In the interim, we encourage the monitoring of three key indicators on a regular basis:

  a.  Bond yields of Eurozone sovereign debt, particularly Italy, Spain and France.

  b.  Quantum of capital flight out of the Eurozone to countries like Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

  c.  Euro-dollar exchange rate and for how long does the euro remain propped up vis-a-vis the dollar.

6.  Time will tell whether the splendid isolation of the United Kingdom is momentary.

7.  When a number of European countries' parliaments begin to question the fine print of the fiscal compact, those nations may fall out like thieves post their heist.

8.  Despite the euphoria associated with this fiscal compact, the Eurozone may continue to lurch from one crisis to the next.

9.  Vital issues remain unresolved including access to trillions of euros to ensure financial and economic stability.

10.  Is the European fiscal compact a mutual suicide pact of simultaneous austerity, which may cause negative growth to regress to a full blown depression?

11.  Are we optimistic?  For the United Kingdom, yes.  For the rest, we are not so sure!  Is it too early to draw conclusions?  What are your thoughts, observations and views?

[ENDS] It is an auspicious day indeed, when we have the good fortune of witnessing the Supra Universal Consciousness as the divine guiding Master! Thought this would be of interest to y'all... This seems à propos given our ongoing discussions of class, income and spending.

Venkatesh Rao is preemptively adapting to the extinction of the middle class lifestyle by enacting a strategy he calls 'Trading Up': buying premium in some areas of your life, while buying budget or entirely foregoing spending in other areas. Stumbled across this. Wondering what perspectives on it are in this group.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/09/americans-elect-group-gaining-steam Why forgive? Why let go? Why start to smile? Why relax? All separation, every kind of estrangement and alienation is false. All is one! - N a brilliant visual meditation on the long arc of history, and of how civilizations rise and fall.. Hat tip to my new friend Erin McGrane, who was in the film World Builder... I knew the Chinese like to "borrow" intellectual property from others, but this is really "extreme copying"... This is a bit off topic but I am doing a video montage to promote my annual charity trip for mental health (HugTrain.org) and I was wondering if anyone might be willing to help by recording video of themselves singing modified lyrics to Love Train by the O Jays We can talk about difficult things here, right? Things that might be controversial? That's what makes this a great group.

Our recent discussions about whether or not to name the metamovement that many of us see developing is a case in point. Ultimately that conversation converged on a place that seems much better than either of the poles of dichotomy represented by the question: "To name or not to name?"

So I wonder if we might visit another dichotomy that seems to be present here among our thoughts. One not often voiced. Not fully articulated but bubbling under the surface of our social affinities and self-selected groupings.

Reform the old top-down system, or start anew and build from the bottom up?

As a case in point for reforming the top-down system, I present a page that I recently came upon:

https://www.facebook.com/world.unification?sk=info

This strikes me as a very male top-down Western approach to solving our problems. Pulling it all together. Here are the steps:

Step 1- An EU-US Merger 

Step 2- The Institution of Highly Enlightened, Highly Advanced and Highly Evolved Global Policies 

Step 3- Aid to Africa and beyond 

Step 4- The Inclusion of the rest of the Nations into the Global Union

A case in point for building from the bottom-up is the Occupy movement. Since you all know about it I won't go into details here.

So what say ye? Is this a dichotomy with a resolution? What might any such resolution look like? "Around 2000 I fired my boss. Not just a specific boss but all of them, permanently." http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/going-beyond-work-separating-meaning-and-money-and-surviving-meanwhile My new @edgeryders post on money, which goes far, far into the territory of how I actually manage the process of putting nearly everything I own into the Public Domain, and still manage to put a roof over my head.

Words of advice to young people. The next edge in activism: Transformation in the Occupy and Real Democracy movement. Friends who have inspired me this summer to host a Syntagma Café at the Berlin Agora have started this initiative in Greece and will be hosting the first event on December 17 in Athens.

Register here: http://bit.ly/vlr1Ph Why the silence? Until the fog clears in regard to the Eurozone agreement, it is difficult to say anything which is analytically sound. Seb Paquet I thought this might be your kinda thing. There's an #OccupyData Hackathon tomorrow ("Data Mining and Visualization"). I'm not a programmer, but I happen to know something about taxonomies and classification. I looked at all their documents and their solutions to dealing with streams of tweets. I happen to know something about the problems they are likely to encounter tomorrow. It's a good experiment, though. http://civic.mit.edu/event/occupydata-hackathon-data-mining-and-visualization We might enter the book of history as the "Like Generation". An opinion on anything and no time to do much about it. 

(i) inspired by @schlenzalot I've noticed that the Next Edge is fond of neologism. We are natural neologenerators.

This is very handy in the Google era. I pop in a word and not 1 million, nor even 1,000 references come up, just the ones that my friends wrote and their friends and...

Markers and crushed branches in the forest for the other scouts to notice and follow as we explore. With only 600 Secoya elders left in the world, the need to pass on their wisdom calls to us. Join us in during these extraordinary weeks for profound healing and sacred journey. http://ow.ly/7Ue6S Be careful: Can the intention to seek a mythical treasure within life inevitably obscure the reality that life is already the treasure? Centered on the individual experience of their social, natural, spiritual, and intellectual environment. This may be naive but it just struck me, while reading an the Adbusters World in 2010 spoof of Economists World in 2010 and a far more accurate precognitor of how that year would be (with the theme of late capitalism):

People want choice, they are fickle. In capitalism they are encouraged to acquire something that represents the new thing that interests them. 

The question is therefore how does it get easier to decide to choose to be interested in something adaptive and fulfilling, as opposed to desirable but ultimately emptying and depletive? Can that be affected? If so, how? 

How can they be encouraged to instead give or donate something that represents the new thing that interests them? Community, friendship, love. Because when you offer that it comes right back at you in spades. And that makes life. 

How do we get more people thinking that way? I'd sure love to be able to convince myself of this more often! Who wouldn't? I just wrote this post, and I want to know how you see it, and if the conclusions of your own your analysis are similar to mine
 
The multitude movement limited by the pace of cultural change and of general understanding of open movements

http://multitudeproject.blogspot.com/2011/12/multitude-movement-limited-by-pace-of.html I decided to start a new thread on:  "a system for developing and evolving a single unified taxonomy of meaning and terms along with a system of mapping between different evolving views of the same ideas that can bridge cultures and languages," so as not to derail the "Tools We Need" thread too much. I was deeply touched by  Vinay Gupta's honest account of the precarity of trying to do important work at the edge and think it will resonate with some of the people in here... Is it just me or are things getting very interesting very fast?

3: The Electric Jesus the Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic
http://www.evolver.net/user/jonathan_phillips/project/electric_jesus_presentation_book

this is an incredible and brave account of someone way more mainstream than we're used to (read; as opposed to 'crazy hippies' and 'new agey freaks' etc) losing himself, and finding himself again, through a process of spiritual and personal awakening that is suprising to no one quite as much as it is to him. 

Jonathan Philips is one of the founders of the wonderful and important evolver community, and here he has the courage to speak openly about his experiences basically beginning to believe, in all seriousness, that everything is real: magic, aliens, miracles, and yes, jesus -- whether or not you are a skeptic this is a beautiful journey to read and share. "Not to dream boldly may turn out to be irresponsible," said educator George Leonard. You have a sacred duty not only to yourself, but also to the people you care about, to use your imagination more aggressively and expressively as you contemplate what might lie ahead for you. You simply cannot afford to
remain safely ensconced within your comfort zone, shielded from the big
ideas and tempting fantasies that have started calling and calling and
calling to you.

Dear friends,

Born out of a collaboration between Net Impact and the School for Visual Art's new Design for Social Innovation MFA program, the world’s first Designathon for Corporate Social Responsibility was held this past September. As a demonstration of the program’s curriculum of bringing students together with business and social ventures to solve real world problems, the designathon paired faculty from the program with 6 companies who submitted their challenges for engaging their communities in corporate social responsibility and sustainable practices.

Here’s a film. (http://dsi.sva.edu/designathon/short-film/)
And an article in shareable (http://bit.ly/soOgv1)
Our Facebook group (http://on.fb.me/tmB5qG)

Thanks for your interest, please let us know if you’d like to know more about the program.

Best,

Cheryl I still have a tool problem. measuring risk holistically across environmental and social dimensions is not possible in the deals i want to do right now. i have a tool problem. Do we make choices consciously, supraliminally or subliminally? What's it that we 'choose' as we go through our lives as the interconnected? You are invited to a memorial service for Susan London!

Special thanks to Beverly DesChaux, Rita Reneaux, Brigitte Desouches, Bonita Mugnani, and Deborah Allen and others for taking the lead in creating the logistics and the vision for this event (still lovingly under construction). From Scott, Susan's son: Susan passed away the morning of Tues, Nov 29, quietly and peacefully. She went to sleep last night and never woke up. I don't want to pretend I can speak for her, but I imagine that if she could, she would express deep and wide gratitude to each one of you for your prayers, loving thoughts, and your presence in her life. Then she would tell you that she's doing just fine now, ask you to take a moment to feel her love for you, and then go out and live great lives and take good care of yourselves. Jean Russell's last post and Yosem E Companys' article on free enterprise prompted me to share here an article I wrote in We Magazine Australia that was recently released. I wrote it in July after watching BBC's 3 part documentary "All Watched over by Machines of Loving Grace". I found this series quite intriguing and provocative for systems thinking, computer science, genetics, libertarianism, alternative communities and IT altogether. Yet there was a compelling message there that I finally managed to put my finger on:  the point I assume Adam Curtis was trying to make was that the combination of all these, even when individually not directly aimed at disempowering us as human beings, left us powerless and stunned as a result… The point of my article is to get away from paralyzing determinism...

http://loudsauce.com/campaigns/59-3-days-to-choose-billboard-that-greets-bay-bridge-commuters-on-way-to-2012 I believe a lot of us here have a deep thirst for insight. What is the most insightful thing you have ever heard? Answer here or share with the world on Quora. Creating a sustainable economy–having enough to be happy without cheating the future–won’t be easy. But "The Economics of Enough" starts a profoundly important conversation about how we can begin–and the first steps we need to take. Vital insight for change-makers.

I have the whole day stop over... When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently: 1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. 2. I wish I didn't work so hard. 3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings. 4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. 5. I wish that I had let myself be happier. Life is a choice. It is your life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose honestly. Choose happiness. what happens if our politicians dance in order to explain why to invade a country? or to bail out a bank?

i've mentioned the desire to curate some type of online publication as a resource for us systems innovators to keep a pulse on the edge.

as a first step, it would be great to know what your favorite sources are. for me, i find myself mostly using twitter lists around specific content areas, but there are a few blogs and newsletters and major publications i also subscribe to.

i'm on iphone right now, so just posting this comment, but would like to compile this into a doc so we can use ourselves as filters to sift through the noise, and bubble up the top people and publications that curate news, research, trends, and cool stuff we should know about.

drop in your links here for now, and anyone interested in more seriously spending a few mental cycles with me on how this publication/curated newsfeed could work, let me know.

Thanks everyone! How we could involve the hacker spaces into the #JELLYWEEK ? http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces It's a very valuable infrastructure for the global coworking movement. It would have a great impact to connect them. Any ideas? /// http://www.jellyweek.org Thanks to Willi Schroll from Social Foresight Network for promoting the idea of WORLDWIDE #JELLYWEEK 2012 in January ! Be part of it ! Everybody is a coworker ! Users of reddit recently latched onto the idea of building a darknet (IE, an anonymized backup network of shared information/communication)... and it couldn't be at a better time with SOPA on the loose and general government/corporate wackiness with the internet.  Lots of techie types available, so it will be interesting to monitor this project as it moves forward.  Just wanted to give everyone here the heads up. hi all, i'm planning to do a writeup looking at the most interesting reputation/trust models out there right now. i know pietrust (http://www.pietrust.com/) has been mentioned here before. do you have any other suggestions of things i should check out? thank you! - v "Please join us for a reception to celebrate the passage of the Flexible Purpose Corporation legislation with its author Senator Mark DeSaulnier...[and the] Working Group [who] have dedicated hundreds of hours pro bono to drafting and advancing this corporate form... We will honor and celebrate those involved for their continuing dedication to social entrepreneurs, corporate social responsibility, and environmental sustainability."  Mon, 12/5 in San Francisco.  Don't mind the 11/28 rsvp deadline, but I assume the sooner the better... as promised, here's my 2011 mixtape. please share yours too! As societies, we really need to fix the problem of salary disparity based on sex. Perhaps the only solution is simply to make all salaries public.

Is this a U.S. problem, a Western problem, or a global problem. Loving the dedication to opening things up demonstrated by some of the OWS people... in response to the media's "demand for demands" - They have a site with downloadable posters with suggestions - with QR codes linking to in depth info on each of the wonky points they raise. http://wedontmakedemands.org/about.php 

I post it here because I feel it's a jujitsu move on their part - and very next edge in terms of civic discourse as well as undermining deeply the trope that they are uninformed entitled dirty trustafarians.... What is sin and what is virtue? Difference is nothing save labels which our culture, creed and religion have put on our transitionary deeds. I love the work IDEO does... Wow, I'm part of a "secret group". I feel so undercover :) There's something about leaders that has always fascinated me. They seem to behave like protons in atomic physics. For starters, they seem to exert an attractive force on followers who start 'orbiting' them (behaving in an analogous fashion to electrons). 

However, their relationship to one another appears to be more complicated. I perceive both attraction/cooperation and repulsion/competition forces at work between leaders. Has anybody else noticed something like this? dear friends, does any of you have a project that would benefit from a bit of extra exposure that a  little article on the p2p blog would bring? now is a good time to propose articles, as I'm on a lecture tour and have trouble keeping up the flow. It has to be in english, no particular other requirements but not written in ad speak. This statement was made on the steps of the Suffolk county superior court during a press conference Occupy Boston called an hour before the court hearing with the city & BPD. This is why we occupy. This is the country, economy and future we sleep outdoors in 30 degree storms and what we work ardently for! The Government of India has offered 51% foreign direct investment for Multi-brand retail (read Walmart) companies and claims that this will help Indian farmers, Industry and increase employment in India.  And the US ambassador to India here goes out of the way to campaign for this. Any merit in the Government and US embassy claim? "The vision is simple: if everyone lived in intentional, sustainable communities – villages, city/town blocks – then the whole world would be sustainable. Supporting that vision is the Open World Villages networking site, newly launched by the Open World Foundation." What is 'Non-duality' or 'Advaita'? As the Upanishads put it, 'to be freed of the pairs of opposites!' There in lies the great liberation... #JELLYWEEK STATISTICS: 38 HOSTS from 13 COUNTRIES in 5 CONTINENTS are participating in January. Each day new entries. Welcome Brooklyn & Honolulu (US), Turin & Allessandria (Italy), Stockholm (Sweden) with Open World Café and Poznan (Poland) ! Coworking is growing and the intersections with innovation, changemaker and entrepreneurship networks ! 

NEXT EDGE   ////    BE PART OF THE #JELLYWEEK : http://g.co/maps/q8hcu

If you are having difficulties registering your event on the map please send your Jelly info to the #ONEWORLD ambassador Julianne Becker: julianne@deskwanted.com. She will do the registration for you. This is a film being funded through kickstarter of Esalen by the (incredible) writer Jeff Kripal (having read 'America and the religion of no religion' I'm enthralled with the idea of his involvement in this movie) -- so consider making a small donation + 4 more members and we will be 1111 before the year turns 2012.  Interpret as you like, it's your context anyway. That's The Next Edge way. Hi friends - This is available 1 more day ONLY. Please spread the word to those who want to make their businesses fly while supporting a beautiful cause. A whopping 80% of proceeds go to this awesome initiative!!! I know you have heard of Occam's Razor but have you heard of Hilbert's problems? Somehow a formula here probably has a correlation to the power of influence & energy . . . just got a hunch . . .http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertsProblems.html Thought I'd share that my blog this week is a tribute to The Next Edge member Anthony Lawlor. Thank you, kind sir, for inspiring my work this week. And thank you, The Next Edge, for generously sharing Anthony Lawlor with me. You are a gift. Discussion starter: As I think more and more about our current time of liminality, I keep coming back to the following question: 

What can leadership learn from this gap between where our faltering institutions are & where our greater good needs them to be? What is in that space betwixt and between that we are not yet entirely owning? this seems like a good place for crazy hare brained ideas. Bank of America is trading at a 52 week low of $5.07 and falling. If the stock drops below $5 pool tons of cash together (say a billion) have some shareholder activism, talk to Buffet to join in and wage a proxy war to replace the board and make BOA answer to people.  http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/29/news/companies/bank_ratings_downgrades_sandp/ The Future We Want is a global conversation launched by the UN today at 10 am in NY. The goal it seems is to crowdsource visioning and open source toolkit around the June 2012 Rio Earth Summit.

Here is the time line of the project:

Launched today Nov 22
Global Crowdsourcing Launch in February
Interactive Exhibit and production in March
Rio The Future we want conference in June
Open Source visioning and toolkit complete in Jan 2013 

How can this group contribute to this?
The project is driven by Natural Capitalist Solutions and has been mentioned by Hunter Lovins a few weeks ago, but not with this type of interactivity. SPREAD THE WORD! Today only --> Please share this with folks who want to learn how to make their businesses fly......and support a beautiful cause! Gracias!!!!! I don't know what the posting policy is for the group, so slap me down if this kind of thing isn't welcome, but I'm interested to know if there's been an effort to organize media/storytelling resources around new paradigm thinking. I produce videos and motion graphics professionally, and would love to devote free cycles to storytelling around projects that are strong in low-level execution but weak in designed communication about their structure, purpose or vision. I'm sure others feel this way as well - graphic designers, publishers, etc. I'm particularly interested in storytelling around the intersection of technology and values shifts. In the spirit of people sharing their work, here are my thoughts on the future (and present) - touches on OWS. nods to John Hagel. http://thrivable.net/2011/11/unfolding/ Thanks for the invite to this group, Edward Harran! Sounds like a great hub for those of us who are helping our world to connect and evolve. Here's my current project... The Economics of Happiness conference - March 23-25 2012, Berkeley - $250 I saw this on Hacker News. My favorite quote:

This may sound rudimentary, but the difference between being good and being the best, is how different, how weird, how not normal you become. I learned this after playing Counter-Strike.

When you grow up, everybody tells you that you can do anything you put your mind to. I think this is true. My Counter-Strike career reaffirmed that belief.

However, what they don't tell you is that putting your mind to something is not normal. Putting your mind to something means doing things that normal people don't. That's the only way to be exceptional. People who really put their mind in to something are different. They're weird. There's something wrong with them. There's something different that makes them tick.

I wanted to be exceptional. I wanted be to the best in the world at something. That's what made me tick. Counter-Strike was the medium I chose to achieve that. would be good to play this i think... setup another subgroup for those participating in the next edge online publication - so that we can keep things coherent - and out of the main flow here.. there are a few people who signed up for the blog who i'm not connected to so i could add them to this group - so if you've not been added to the group please come and add yourself :) Hold onto your hat. The EU may be falling apart... Ecological Sanitation continues to pick up speed! Going beyond awareness, there is a state of non-duality, no cognition, only pure being. All separation ceases in non-duality. - Nisargadatta i responded to a post of Venessa Miemis earlier about "i've mentioned the desire to curate some type of online publication as a resource for us systems innovators to keep a pulse on the edge." by putting up a wordpress install at thenextedge.org - head over there and register if you'd like to play! cc Seb Paquet & hackademy Concentration, meditation, making our mind peaceful, reading spiritual literature, and if possible, the guidance of a true spiritual master! More evidence that the myth of free markets and free enterprise in the US is a sham and that its system of government has been completely captured. This is amazing news, just broken by Bloomberg, from Freedom of Information Act reports. The Fed's support for banks during the crisis absolutely dwarfed the hugely controversial TARP program from Treasury. 

Here's what even Bloomberg (yes, *that* Bloomberg) says:

* Details suggest taxpayers paid a price beyond dollars as the secret funding helped preserve a broken status quo and enabled the biggest banks to grow even bigger. In this document you find everything about the WORLDWIDE #JELLYWEEK 2012, which will happen in January: http://www.dezentrale.eu/docs/jellyweek12/Worldwide_Jellyweek_2012.pdf. REGISTRATION http://g.co/maps/q8hcu. Let's start to co-create.

___ How can your project be connected with the WORLDWIDE #JELLYWEEK 2012 (http://www.jellyweek.org/) ?

___ What kind of milestone could the #JELLYWEEK 2012 be in the process of your project? Which contributions could your project make for organizing the #JELLYWEEK 2012 ?

___ E.g. how we can have a strong and smart technological solution for communicating globally during the #JELLYWEEK 2012 and beyond ?

___ What kind of technical, organizational, social and cultural prototypes can we develop before, during and after the #JELLYWEEK 2012 for the enrichment of a global coworking culture ? BELIEF GRID: how we use frameworks of concepts to create limitation or freedom http://bit.ly/bJb2Uj Fed's secret gift of $13 billion in profits for banks – Congress and public kept in dark (Bloomberg News) http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/secret-fed-loans-undisclosed-to-congress-gave-banks-13-billion-in-income.html I'm likely to see Urbanized, the new Gary Hustwit documentary (Helvetica, Objectified) Tues. It's only in NYC a few more days. Hi everyone!  Been enjoying the conversation from the sidelines.  A question--I have written an op Ed piece that's about 500 words on the body politic Occupy Wall Street through the lens of a family therapist.  Any sense of where would be a good place to publish it? "this movement has to be about the transformation of self and community. we cannot continue to treat each other and regard each other the way we have been. this movement is about the elevation of consciousness. we have awakened. no more of 'as-it-was-before'. we are live. we are one."

I tried to "copy" the group on the above, which I posted via my twitter a bit earlier. When Occupy Philly was being evicted a few hours ago, various speakers took the mike and I transcribed some of their words from the live feed. This is particular felt prescient, perfect, and beautifully put. I thought you'd all appreciate it -- it's our movement, too, describes all the work and energy and effort and actions we're beginning, continuing, making be. <3 Hi. New topic based on Open World Village thread, if you'll humor me: Given that sometimes, people (at the most highly granular level) can't self-sustain - they're babies, frail, or mentally or physically ill (acute or chronically). And sometimes, a family can't manage, due to hardship (breadwinner falls ill; or the family caregiver). Or sometimes, the families in the community have worked out ways to support each other during times of vulnerability, but look! here comes the 3rd 1000-year drought of the decade.... you see my point? The questions to me about transformation are: (a) how do we create cultural change to measure what we value and (b) how do we deal with the inability to be "useful" within that context of what we value? ...... The "vision" I personally think we're really looking for is the creation of an information ecosphere + social transformation to allow for vulnerability. (Yin/yang; Right/Left...)  ... But what about you? Thoughts on this? Who do you know who is working this into their world-views / research agendas etc.? A serious analysis by Peter Boone and Simon Johnson. Why have I not heard this story before? Amazing. We need better curation.

http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2011/11/27/opensource-edible-landscapes-the-todmorden-story/ I know this is not the purpose of our forum. However, I feel that for American citizens everywhere this idea might galvanize our collective feelings. I can't help wonder at the power of symbology. Might this get the message through?

Fly the flag—upside down.

Officially, the United States of America's flag should be flown upside-down when in DISTRESS. Fellow Americans, join me in flying this sign of distress across our land and everywhere online. Let's send a clear message to our elected officials, business leaders, and spiritual leaders.

We are united, we really are.
We are angry at the injustices and corruption we keep learning about.
People are really hurting, and your actions are making a mockery of their suffering.

This idea, to fly the flag upside-down, is offered as a unifying contribution to the Occupy movement; one that we can all participate in regardless of location or situation. 

It's time to reclaim our own sovereignty. Just wanted to let those not in the USA know about some of the nonsense we Americans have to deal with right now. Example: effort to pass a Bill declaring America a "battlefield" and permitting "indefinite detention" of American citizens.  What will the Right / Military Industrial Complex think of next? Well worth the 2 hours it will take to watch! An incredible blend of real world challenges talked about by UN experts and proof of how Science Fiction can help the public think through such challenges as well. Brilliant article about waging peace 
http://bit.ly/uNAreM and now for something completely different... (humor) My comments from a quick chat with the brilliant David Hodgson "the essential thought is that we must divine new models of collaboration in the financial space among projects enterprises groups efforts funds bankers etc - otherwise it will remain a competitive cluster - time to divine new ways of sharing value, money, innovation, IP, etc. as the framework for our collective efforts. 
Mainly because many many of us are coming to similar conclusions independently and in parallel thoughts a couple years ago:

hey all. i made a mixtape last thanksgiving of songs i was into and to express gratitude for the community of people out there changing the world and inspiring me. i invited people via my blog and twitter to make a playlist of their own (via grooveshark, or whatever music service they use), and then share their list so we can all discover some new tunes and learn more about each other. i'm doing it again now, and thought it would be fun for TNE; so anyone who would like to play, add your link in the comments section here and i'll add it to a blog post that will go up monday morning. hope you're all having a great holiday weekend!

http://emergentbydesign.com/2010/11/25/thanksgiving-gratitude-playlists/ tomorrows yi-tan call from Jerry Michalski

I'm not sure I buy the Mayan calendar warnings, but it sure does look like something major is coming.

What if the global financial crisis, the awakenings around the world, warnings of climate change and chronic underemployment are just the overture? 

Where might these all lead in 2012? A Singularity? (if so, what kind?) The awakening of global consciousness? The collapse of the money economy? (and the rise of local self-reliance) 

Together, let's discuss:
Is 2012 just hype, or do you think it's a turning point?
Turning what? Which narratives make sense to you?
What should we do to prepare for your scenario?
As always, an IRC chat will be available during the call at #yitan.

We tweet as @yitan (and use #yitan as our hashtag). Please follow us on Twitter. This page is on the web here.

http://openarchitecturenetwork.org/projects/bamboomanual Any web artists/designers who want to help the Next Edge Hackademy? We're working on prototypes for building trust networks. They are programmer ugly at the moment. Let me know and I'll add you to the group and point you to the discussion. We don't need real designs at the moment, just some help with CSS for about 8 base elements. Very easy stuff by CSS standards. Tiberius Brastaviceanu reflects on Occupy struggles. "If we put a lot of good willing individuals together in one place, in harsh conditions, they will NOT necessarily spontaneously self-organize into a perfect society!" Fellow Next Edger's, 

I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to put my talents to work... any of you have ideas about people who might want to hire someone with my special talents?  I'm willing to relocate for temporary or full-time opportunities.

Thanks,

Joe

Here's my CV:

http://www.chaoticripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Joe-Brewer-CV-2011.pdf Hi folks, I just put in an application to receive an invitation to the http://www.tallbergfoundation.org/ 2012 Forum. Has anyone attended this before? Looks amazing! Let's build a GLOBAL-CROWD-CUBATOR!

PLEASE SPREAD!!!
IMAGINE ALL NEW BUSINESS IN THE WORLD WOULD BE CREATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AND SUPPORTING GLOBAL SOCIAL, ECOLOGICAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE.

Hi everybody!
Some friends and I have been putting up this event (which shall turn into a movement) within the last three weeks. It's meant to bring entrepreneurs, people with ideas and visions together to figure out a way how every new project and business in the world can be brought to life in the context of and supporting global change for the better of mankind and natur in it's whole. We want this barcamp to spread all around the world to form a collaborative community and to build the infrastructure we need which could be called a global crowd cubator (Imagine a place where you could go with an idea and get all the support and ressources and where you can access a worldwide collaborating community to get it going and your input can be from an idea to manpower, goods, money or whatever)
If a big part of what is wrong in this world comes from businesses, lets replace them by better ones. Especially those everyone is in the need for. Let's create them in a way they serve mankind and nature.
As we put this all together in a really short time its all pretty chaotic ....but in my oppinion chaos is the best environment for the flow of creativity.
You can find more information on our website http://funkybusinessberlin.de/index_en.html (guess this title will also change within the next weeks) and the facebook group funky business berlin.
You're all invited to join us. We want to use an infrastructure that everybody who can't participate locally can take part via the internet. If we don't have it running until monday we sure will get it going during the week.
My very personal goal is to have reached a million people by the 4th of december. That might sound unlikely but it sure can be done. And if this works we will be able to continue working here at the cluboffice at least till newyears.
Also the creation of the GLOBAL-CROWD-CUBATOR will be part of the Jellyweek worldwide http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=198254403541920 let's rock the planet :-D
Finally if this all spreads througout the world we will bring all these people together next summer at Berlin Templehof for one week to put the best ideas together and get'em going. All this of course will be hell of a legendary party.
Turning good ideas into facts just needs to become much much easier, needs to become rock 'n roll.
yours Dirk straight from Berlin where da funk rocks
Ps.: if you want to help or need any additional information please contact me via facebook dirk van haag or mail dirk@van-haag.eu or find me on skype

To the existing governance and economy: If you want to be part of the change too please feel free to make use of our creative power and confront us with your challenges. 5-fold decrease in maturation time?  1% of industrial farm water use?  Sounds too good to be true, but regardless, the increased growth density is impressive.  $45k for the biggest unit seems expensive (but understandable, it's a novel idea), seems like people could be making something similar with a reprap/fabber for much cheaper. A direct and good account of the young people at Tahrir. I wanna start a Next Edge Hacker Corps. Who's in? Is appreciation and thankfulness the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever the Cosmos shines Its light? Lobbyists vying for $850,000 contract to smear OWC.
DHS advising mayors on "how to suppress" protests.
Congressmen legislating their own companies' profits /massively profiting from trading on non-public information they have on companies about which they are legislating http://bit.ly/u5p7Ua Just back from a screening of 'How to Start a Revolution' documentary on Gene Sharp, author of 'From Dictatorship to Democracy' which inspired many of the nonviolent government takeovers in recent years. Its most poignant message was that these nonviolent movements were anything but passive. They were properly planned and deployed, utilizing a strategic mix of the nearly 200 political, social, psychological and economic tools that Sharp has developed to destabilize those in power... I spoke with the film's director, Rauridh, afterwards about #occupy movement. He feels it is massively underutilizing many of the components developed by Gene... is anyone here familiar with Sharp's work and could provide insight regarding #occupy? (links below)... A beautiful new edition of "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" has been published. Check out the "look inside" option! (hat tip: David McConville If you'd like to support the WOMEN OF THE AMERICAS SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVE, www.kleiwerks.org/WASI, and take online classes about living the life you want, check out this 3-day sale.

What gives you peace within? When things are in balance within, are they also in balance without? As inner so outer? As above so below? I wanted to pass on this 45 min documentary on North Korea done by Nat'l Geographics. Some very profound images here. Been doing some writing in Milgram's obedience studies, and bells of obedience and authority were ringing in my ear. Have a great post-Thanksgiving day!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLBywKrTf4 Q1: What views do you hold that appear to differ significantly from those of your colleagues in The Next Edge? 

Q2: Have you felt comfortable enough to argue at least one of these views within the group even if no one else understood or agreed with you? Can you provide a pointer to the discussion so that others might learn from it?

Q3: What is the gender distribution for those of us who can answer yes to Q2? How do we get that close to a 50/50 split? What can we do to make vigorous debate less gendered?

[Everybody here is likely highly individualistic. I'm wondering whether we are capable exploring and harnessing individualism to even higher orders.] Simply sublime: you are cordially invite to a book launch in london on 14th december: https://wisdombooklondon.eventbrite.com/ the book goes into why i think this group is amazing, and also why i have been so disciplined about my involvement...there is also a book launch in scotland too next weekend... it is all p2p so please pass on to those who might benefit :) be well! Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun.

- John Newton, English slave trader turned poet, 1773 Where there is joy there is creation. Where there is no joy there is no creation: know the nature of joy! - Veda Upanishads, 800 BCE i give thanks to you all for the inspiring and transformational work you are doing to help create a world that works for 100% of humanity! 
(to borrow a phrase from Bucky :) Yet another very interesting-looking resource (based in Oregon I believe)...

http://www.illuminatedmind.net/blog/ http://metacurrency.org/ Please follow the coworking wave: http://twitter.com/#!/jelly_world How can you guys connect your projects with this worldwide event in January ? Does anyone remember MySpace? Yeah, me neither, I never got into it much there. But I did like Tribe.net-still do somewhat--and I did like ONet. I always have thought that ONet was worth some serious study of online social networks because of its relatively small size and such intense participation by the members in discussion about the network.

To a some extent what it was about ONet can be glimpsed at Ned.com For example I went over there this afternoon to revisit a thread started by Arthur Brock on the reputation system http://www.ned.com/group/ned/news/8/

Ned.com is still going, but there's little participation there now. In this group there are some who participated at ONet and a few who migrated to Ned when it closed down. What made ONet so unusual was how theory was tested in quick and dirty experiments. It's something that seems familiar to what's happening in this group. 

So I'm just putting a post up in case anyone wants to point to experiments there. I would also be happy for thoughts about Tribe.net  Both places seem to offer some insights for the emergence and trajectory of Next Edge. Happy Thanksgiving on The Next Edge! http://spacecollective.org/starwalker/7190/The-Evolution-of-Consensus Parable of the turkey.
"1. In the morning, a nice man comes for a visit.  
2. He puts food in your bowl.  
3. The food is fresh and tasty.  
4. The food is always in plentiful supply.
5. At night there's a warm place to sleep.  
6. The next day, the process is repeated.  The nice man visits, he feeds you, and you sleep comfortably.  It repeats day after day.   
7. You think: everything is right with the world.  How could anything possibly go wrong?"
http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/11/are-you-a-turkey.html Hi! we're presenting Edgeryders at the European Parliament next week. Would be a nice occasion for an Edgeling meetup, no? You're welcome to attend the presentation too, drop me a line if you want to do either and or :) https://www.facebook.com/events/235164776549001/ This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honourably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Be grateful for whomever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

Happy Thanksgiving! A Next Edge greeting to my pal Nathaniel Koloc.  He recently founded ReWork (http://rework.jobs/), which connects high-impact organizations with exceptional people looking for meaningful employment. Good stuff! been thinking about this for some time ... welcome feedback on the thoughtstream ... Gratitude to whomever initated this group, it's a great resource TJ Barbe recommended the short story, Manna, by Marshall Brain, after he and I chatted about our respective visions for the future, and the dystopic future that we are heading towards if we don't pay attention. It captures much of what we both see possible for the future, both the good and the bad.

Highly recommended for any Next Edgers. Completely online and fairly short. I wonder what you'd all tell these high school graduates as they step into the "real world".  Have a great holiday.  I'm thankful I'm still standing. http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/22/how-the-future-looks-from-high-school/?hp Hi Edgelings:) our Edgeryders project has been featured on the UNDP blog. Here's the link for those interested: True or False, the next edge is outside the United States. Know any women entrepreneurs who need $50K? http://pipelinefellowshippitchsummit.producteev.com/home.php Anybody here has good media contacts at the big networks and or papers? I have friends in Egypt who are really keen to share their first person stories from the protests and what is happening in Egypt. Thanks a lot for any good links. Esteemed colleagues,  what would be your most succinct definition of the concept 'leadership' - is it a matter of the willingness to go first? or are there other factors involved, and what might they be? what is a leader's relationship to those around them? In truth everything and everyone
Is a shadow of the Beloved,
And our seeking is His seeking
And our words are His words...
We search for Him here and there,
while looking right at Him.
Sitting by His side, we ask:
'O Beloved, where is the Beloved?'
 
- Rumi Hey everyone! I wanted to share this project that myself and 4 other scientists produced, a video titled, "Let's Talk About Evolution". 

"This video was produced to allow scientists to explain, in their own words, the importance of evolution to science -- and the related importance of teaching evolution in schools. Our goal is to convey the fact that evolution is an amazing, uplifting discovery that has served as the genesis of countless advances in many fields of science. We also wanted to highlight female role models in the science community."

Here's why I wanted to share it with this group: We had a message to get out. We had no funding, just passion and courage. So the five of us set out, asking female scientists to participate and lend us their voice to communicate this topic. We asked them to submit videos explaining in their own words why evolution is a critical concept to be taught in schools. We then created a mash-up of all the videos, and scripted it into the video you see here. Again—we all donated our time and efforts, and made our idea come to fruition. 

It was just released yesterday, so we are still getting feedback and reactions, but the point is this: If you have an idea, a topic you are passionate about, don't wait around for a million-dollar donation. There are some steps you can take now, without large amounts of cash. Small ripples. Get out there and do it. :) 

http://richarddawkins.net/videos/643936-let-s-talk-about-evolution A high-leverage recommendation for fixing unemployment by a "presidential candidate":) There is quite a lot of overlap between this list and Hub members, and I'm wondering if the Hubbers, or anyone else in the Bay Area has ideas for creating more community & interaction, among social venturers. 

When I joined the Hub a couple of years ago there was a LOT more community activity than now - "sexy salad" lunches were busy in Berkeley - there were a number of working groups, evening meetings etc that helped find out who else you shared the space with.   Most of this seems to have disappeared - and I'm looking for more ways to connect with other interesting Social Venturers in the Bay Area.

The example that brings it to front of mind is that I need to find a place to live for when I get back to the Bay Area in February, I'd love to share with other Social Venturers, but there aren't even paper noticeboards at Hub SoMa or Berkeley, and I understand the email list can't be used for those kind of things … so how to even communicate that I'm looking? 

By the way ... are there any other Co-working spaces in the Bay Area with a social-venture flavor, most seem to be techies/coders. Gideon Rosenblatt: "The true nature of the firm is nature, and it is now time to look to biology for guidance on how it creates value in the new, networked era — the era of radical connectedness." What will the new capitalism look like in practice and what will the new "banking" be - A case study on Pasture Based Agriculture http://queenstreetcommons.org/2011/11/22/what-is-the-core-of-the-new-banking-model-trust/ Summon Seb Paquet - introducing Mariana Soffer Eli Gothill got the Next Edge Hackers fired up with this simple proposal, which I wanted to echo here:  

"I am interested in the possibility of mining Twitter lists to derive Trust Networks. It seems like this could be a useful cross-purpose tool for communities, as well as relatively easy to build."

So basically, people put people in a specific list with the understanding that listing someone carries a strong implication of trust. These signals together define a meaningful community / social network of trust. 

Does this gets anyone's imagination fired up? Where might something like this go? Take part. @Jelly Greece asked you a question. https://www.facebook.com/questions/278831282154169/?qa_ref=ns Seems like things are picking up here... what happened? Anybody know? Michel Bauwens just pointed me to this one. A game changer as far as credit cards and bank transfers (including paypal) are concerned. Dwolla isn't into alternative currency. They are firmly based in the (US) Dollar economy, but their model is disruptive nevertheless. What do you think? Money - pick-me-up: In this video Bernard Lietaer starts with what the Occupy movements may stand for, moves on to the systemic issues of monetary monoculture and introduces the reason the Swiss economy is so amazingly stable -  resilience through monetary diversity. Without realizing, we already use complementary currencies. Listen to  what happens where society puts these to good use.  Hat tip Michel Bauwens. 

Video 23:39, stop at any time and still get it.  

http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/bernard-lietaer-on-the-need-for-monetary-democracy-and-diversity/2011/11/21 were we to begin taking actions towards developing a 'Next Edge' publication of sorts, something that borrowed from the flavors of The Futurist, Good.is, Reality Sandwich, Evolver, EnlightenNext, Fast Co Design, Shareable, and some solid trends and research of what's on the edge, what would we need to keep in mind? how do we curate a leading publication of 'what's important'? what are the filters? what topics or themes matter most? cc Adam Scislowicz David Hodgson Wishing you all a healthy, happy, Thanksgiving:

Outside ideas of right doing and wrong doing there is a field, I'll meet you there! - Rumi if any of you will be in SF on December 5th i hope you can join us as we begin to convene the next edge of finance here in the bay area :) Something about myself:

I bought my first computer when I was 11 (I am 39). At 15 I started reading about Turing and Artificial Intelligence, and also programming in Prolog and Lisp. Since then I have always been interested in areas I consider related to AI.

Nowadays I am back doing Natural Language Programming (in English, Spanish and Portuguese).

There are many areas I am also fascinated with such as:

-Machine Learning Algorithms

-Cognition

-Neuroscience

-Anthropology (also the study of actual society)

-Social Network evolution and Modeling

-Linear Algebra, Graph Theory, Quantum physics

-Multivariate Statistics, Data-mining

-Genetics; worked in the area of Marker Assisted Selection. Breeding plants choosing the ones with genetic characteristics more likely to have a progeny that expresses the desired traits

-Data Visualization

-What effect did technological changes cause on society and individual human beings

-Art, Specially poetry

-...

I believe that true insight/learning/evolution occurs when there is a true connection. Among two different fields of study that can be related or Between two human beings. . . . it has seemed like political instability, ecological crises, cronyism, corruption, and an overheated construction sector was going to give at some point. . .   is this the beginnings of a whole new phase of the global economic downturn?

(my email is at bottom of attached blog post.) enjoy! i pulled this post together the other week, with a list of cool self-assessment tests you can take to get clarity about your inherent strengths. as i've been thinking about growing our next edge community into something where collaborations and co-creative activities can become a lot more rapid and fluid, i think understanding our potential roles within a team or creative process are important. and these are pretty fun to take either way. if there are any cool assessments that you've taken that i missed on the list, please let me know! - venessa http://t.co/QloKYccK Gen Y will change the world http://www.ourworldtoday.com.au/news/article/gen-y-will-change-the-world Here's a map of the Facebook MindTime participants, so far. MindTime has yet to grow into government and administrative environments, hence the lack of Present thinkers. It will, it's been growing for a few months in that direction. When you look at the Next Edge map in comparison you get a sense of how Future oriented we are as a group.

The outcome of this is massive idea generation and sharing (call it uber brainstorming), lots of good high level data (65,000 ft), and not a lot of action as a group. What is really interesting is how many groups have spun off conversations and projects from this forum, and are working on really cool stuff.

There's a difference between the culture of the meeting place (brainstorm and share openly) and the personal commitments and relationships we form from this place (which have more execution in them). The fact that people are actually doing something, outside of this group, is amazing, The fact that this group, as a forum, is generative or so much and engaging so many, is magic.

‘Hackers’, by Reichenstein’s definition, are people who are devoted to making complex matters simple and accessible to the general public. According to Reichenstein, priests are people seeking to standardize and create knowledge. But do so in a form that creates institutions and barriers, rather than a platform for knowledge.

http://www.typoberlin.de/blog/archives/4511 More soon, with post, pics & vids. just a short highlight of yesterday in NYC's #N17 march. 

Bloomberg's publicly funded private army was outnumbered 40 to 1. as occupy took Foley sq & the Brooklyn bridge. with cops trying to cut folks off with barricades only to the swarmed with protesters who used those same fences to push the cops back and out of the way.  (According to NYPD radio channel there where over 40,000 protesters.) 

also had a very vocal retired police captain, in full uniform, from philly join the march. who off course was arrested by nypd.

the great thing is all of it was recorded and most of it was livecasted by both folks on the ground (at least 5 cams) and news chopper live coverage. at a rate of 100 tweets per second with tons of pics & vids uploaded.

http://beyourgovernment.org/ I have been following this group for a few months now, and I would like to know if there are any simple tasks that we may accomplish.  Sure the discussion topics are most stimulating, but when may we take action?  Are there any sub-committees or ad-hoc groups that have been formed that someone could inform me about.  I feel as if we have a group that is capable, motivated, and educated to be able to tackle large problems.  I might be jumping to conclusions without having been a member since the beginning.  I know others have suggested that Facebook may not be the appropriate venue for "doing" and might be best for "informing".  Maybe this is simply a group within Facebook that allows for specific networking opportunities.

Great view of the current Euro-region and global financial crisis of interest to Next Edgers. I'd like to see the data with regional changes as well as what sorts of jobs were most prevalent there.

We'll get some needed publicity and a couple bucks for development work.  And please reshare!  Thanks! This is a 10 years old book, that I read many years ago. I read it again recently and I found it much inspiring, regarding recent emergence and leaderless social movements events and future. Try it. One of the things I love about this group is how diverse we are. So I've been wondering what might happen if Occupy WallStreet could rebrand itself as or merge with "the Next Edge." Some weeks ago I thought of a website where you can nominate the next president. But then I couldn't find it. But today Joshua Foss posted it on twitter and I thought I'd share it with you all. 

It would be really interesting if candidates from the Occupy Wallstreet could emerge. It's an interesting initiative at least. Hi all, just a few random notes from Germany: I was surprised (and encouraged) to see a range of periodicals with a focus on sustainability, social change/equity and related focus areas available  in the regular print media retail shops for newspapers and magazines. I followed up with the distributors and they are reporting growing sales. 
In these media, I found a fair bit of "solution oriented" journalism - also encouraging.

Had a very extensive conversation with a researcher whose focus is on health (he thinks) but whose thinking, in actuality, is circling more and more around future/sustainable/change capacity/society issues. Looks like we will be working on some articles together as a starting point to carry ideas and methods into "conventional workplaces" (whatever this may be). 

Encouraged from Germany,

one may think 
- the occupy movement will have to develop its own economic space
- will develop products certificates can identify with
- build network of local economies
- .. all our economy we occupy 

but what about the economic activity which still belongs to "foreigners"?

Here we all can be creative> we can start "debugging" its production chain!
so one want to buy a jeans which is not produced in own space, then we can ask the shop manger from where he got, who put it in the shelf, which company drove it, .. who saw it, .. who planted its cotton, who bought the seeds, from where, ..
Sure we will not match the whole chain 100%, but the fact we build relationship to those gave value along , we occupy.
It would be cool if there would be a tool for debugging products, based on GIS ..

http://www.peacethroughcommerce.org/ Interesting news in the U.S. that might be of interest to Edgers: HR 2930 - aka the Crowdfunding Exemption Act or Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act passed the House. This bill is very likely to pass the Senate. Obama already has said he'd sign it into law.

There were 407 Aye's and only 17 No's in the House, so passage in the Senate seems assured.

HR 2930 is an exemption to the SEC regs for obtaining investments from more than a small number of individuals. Existing limits are what has prevented there being a KickStarter for investments to replace Angel investments or VC seed rounds. You can't solicit investments publicly unless you already have an established relationship with the investor and they are accredited, and there is a limit to the number of investors you can take even among the ones you do know.

So HR 2930 creates an exemption for investments of less than $10K by any given individual up to $2 million total if the offering is handled by an intermediary and up to $1 million total if there is no intermediary.

There are three implications of this probable new law:

1) There will be many new crowdfunding ventures for these investments. Who knows? Perhaps even Kickstarter and IndieGoGo will accept investments. 

The best new crowdfunding companies will be socially verified trust networks to filter scamming. Reputation will be key here. This is a big opportunity to open up an Angel-like world for investments in local development and many other activities that might not normally attract Angel investors. Spreading out the Angel model into the world of investments that might not have a VC-capable exit, for example.

2) It will probably change the world of Angel investing for tech startups completely. It may be that strong Angels could invest in companies using this new mechanism as a way to fill out a seed round without having to go out to other Angels.

3) Some entrepreneurs will opt for crowdfunding and completely bypass VC and Angel investments even for ventures that would normally be venture fundable. This will shake up the VC world in many unforeseen ways.

I don't know how long it will be before the law takes effect and one can raise money under the new exemptions but it seems like a good time for action. How cool would it be to have some vetted ventures ready to go by the time this law is operative? Social vetting for new investments will be the wave of the future. It will separate the bona-fide investments from the scams. Loving this - "while the Great Disruption is inevitable, humanity is best in a crisis, and, once it all hits, we will rise to the occasion and produce transformational economic and social change (using tools of the Big Shift)." My question to all of you today: what will the next level of disruption look like, and where do you see the next edge of opportunity for those of us creating the new right now?

http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php Responsible business is the change we seek. Oct. 2010, Global Contribution Corp. became one of the first Benefit Corporations in the world. A year later, California, one of 6 with 7 states forthcoming, passed AB-361, allowing for this new class of corporation. http://bit.ly/hKRLAx

The ability to incorporate consideration of people, planet, profit – the triple bottom line – will allow Benefit Corporations to move past the limited focus on pursuit of financial profit, regardless of social and environmental impact.  This represents a positive shift for the way American business is practiced.

Time to CELEBRATE – joining Assembly member Jared Huffman, Senator Mark Leno, New Voice of Business, American Sustainable Business Council, B Lab at Hanson Bridgett next week in celebration of the collective victory of individual businesses, business associations, and California citizens whose support gives California entrepreneurs and investors a better way to do business. Integrity is really important folks. Word gets around about people who are "looking good" off the backs of other people's labor/gifts and not -at least-giving attribution. If you are going to err here, err on the side of disclosing who you talked to, what inspired you, and where you may have noticed threads leading toward your conclusions.

Will you join next Monday's conversation? http://streethostingberlin.posterous.com/conversations-in-the-occupy-cafe "Wave Riders have been with us always, usually unnoticed, or if noticed then treated as a curious exception to the rule. And indeed it often seemed that they were playing by very different rules. There was doubtless a time when we could afford to smile sympathetically at the behavior of the Wave Riders in our midst. When good things happened (the difficult was handled with dispatch, and the impossible achieved with a little more time), we could scratch our heads and wonder at the fabulous run of luck which the Wave Rider obviously enjoyed. It would never occur to us that there might actually be a method in their madness. In fact such thoughts could not occur to us if only because virtually all of our training and experience told us otherwise. Wave Riders were clearly the exception, and we all knew the proper way to do business, what ever that business might be. The critical point was to seize and maintain control in the manner of the Great Man Leader. Only then could good and useful things happen. Or so many of us thought. "

I thought this concept of Empathy Tents at some Occupy sites might resonate with some here.  The thought is to start in Oakland, given proximity.  More info below and at http://cultureofempathy.com/Projects/Empathy-Tent/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This event is just for getting the dialog going and to see if there is support for this idea. Post your ideas, suggestions, if you'd like to be involved, etc. below.

The tent could be a space where Everyone is welcome and be for empathy based processes like;

- Values based discussions
- Mediation, Conflict Resolution
- Meditation
- Art
- Circle Process, Dialog, De-escalation
- Restorative Circles

Big picture perspective for the country's well-being and which majors we should pay for. Non-science majors are not providing enough return on investment. Students might think that they can get a good job now with a non-science major but it's getting more difficult. That's why we should educate the students what to expect before picking their degree. http://t.co/K0Qwv74S Fascinating OWS graphic you can zoom in on...

I thought I'd make myself known and and stop lurking :) A dialogue with Axel Fialka and Alexander Sack from the Movement, and Martin Blessing Commerzbank CEO. Is #OWS safe without numbers? The mayor may be start evicting protestors, if not tonight then soon. Police departments have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, some showing absolutely despicable behavior. Eviction is impossible with great numbers. Evolver asks you for your courage; occupy Liberty Plaza and take part in one of the defining moments of our cultural and planetary evolution. Be the change. "Those “men of action in the capitalist world” were not content with their wealth, they were determined to buy more democracy than anyone else. And they succeeded beyond their expectations." What about a list of suggested discussion points from this group to the #occupy movement? We have a lot of collective forward looking insight happening here...but we are not really communicating with the wider world.... There is a paradox in this system of ours. Progress eliminates jobs (finally) but the elimination of jobs creates a serious bottleneck for the economy: people, as a whole, lack the resources to buy what is being produced. The machine grinds to a halt. What is the solution? Some parts of the world becoming poorer. To recover that richness is part of the future agenda. The Presencing Global Forum was a wonderful experience.  The generative conversations were about "dropping in" to a deeper place or our deeper Selves when working with clients or systems.  While this is obviously one's intent, sharing stories and increasing awareness was very helpful.  One of the conclusions we reached was that the intervenor often experiences a transformation similar to that of the client or system.... and that working with that reality helps facilitate a shift.  

I learned solid tools for collaborative, cross-sector dialogue and I also gained major insights on how to work with clients with depth and presence... to create conditions to transform institutions and shift systems, beginning at a results-oriented, micro level.

www.presencing.com last night we had a great strategy and working meeting & call with other around the country on how to decentralize the occupy movement from the camps into living rooms, town halls, churches, ptas, dorm rooms, class rooms, coffee shops and anywhere else where people can host thier own general assemblies. based on teaching, learning and practical actions with less of the flashy tent cities and police state reactions to them. more info coming soon. look for "We Can Occupy" How can we be conscious of Being? By reclaiming consciousness from the mind... Is this not our most essential task on our spiritual journey? The Declaration of the 99 Percent (from Occupy Wall Street... a pretty darn impressive document)...

http://www.nycga.net/members/the99declaration/ In order to prevent a large number of catastrophes from global warming, we should probably invest more in infrastructure here in the US. This is a good time as a preventative action. Hopefully the market will move faster towards this action when businesses and ecnonomies are being impacted from weather change not just react. :p http://ow.ly/7hbxh Understanding OWS/Greece/Arab Spring, etc.

Exaggeration helps in identifying flaws in concept... and is an art...
TV was and is still an important source of communication and purveyor of social movements. Though, proving that watching TV wastes time isnt tough, but identifying externalities is difficult, therefore any analysis that only takes 'time spent' as an outcome is outrightly flawed. 
On one hand TV watching has reduced over time, though I doubt the statistical significance of this drop. But on the other hand, we need to separate concept of TV and the form factor of TV. If we do so, then our statistics/analysis may tell us something completely different.
Finally a rhetorical question - What do you feel, is TV watching that bad?

http://truthandbeautylondon.tumblr.com/post/12238036803/2011-november-1st-the-future-we-deserve-1 I hope you enjoy the talk. It's very relevant to the kinds of things we discuss here. We cover economics, #Occupy and many other relevant topics... Remarkable story evolving in Greece as investors and markets react to a proposed referendum on austerity and bailout: 
"So although Mr Papandreou's decision to hold a referendum has shocked investors and eurozone leaders, to criticise him would be to argue both that democracy is a bad thing and (many would say naively) that a Greek revival could be possible in the teeth of opposition from Greek people."

And, not to be unnoticed: 
"Following a surprise meeting of the cabinet, Greece's defence minister, Panos Beglitis, sacked the chief of the Greek National Defence General Staff, the chief of the Greek Army General Staff, the chief of the Greek Air Force, and the chief of the Greek Air Force. Beglitis said last month that he wanted to select his own people for the posts because the powerful Greek military was a 'state within the state', according to The Guardian.  However, no official reason has yet been given."

When the lead goose tires, it falls back into the flock and another one takes the lead.

Watch out for that video. i have become more deeply aware over the last week or so what it really means to move from being an organization to being an organism. This is the transformation that we need to make now as a civilization. The shift is from the industrial mindset to the living mindset. An organization is structurally dead, an organism is alive. Being part of something that is dead is a very different experience from being part of something that is alive. Being part of an organization means that you become a character in a play that somebody else wrote, being part of an organism means that you are instead engaged in an improvisational happening. In an organization you know your role, it feels safe, you relate to other people through this definition; in an organism, things can feel uncertain, because we are so used to being defined by a role (but I am not a number, i am a free human being..)

Organizations have value, but it is transient based upon the thing being produced. An organization is a structure intended to produce something specific. 

Hopefully attached to this post is an image i created to visually differentiate between these two modes - the disruptive innovation mode and the production mode... This isn't coming up until end of March, but I thought I'd post it now, anyway.

Can crowdsourcing be a game changer for sustainable brands?  Here's a piece we just had published by Sustainable Life Media.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject. A while ago a friend who researches happiness and wellbing did a great TED talk on his work - the 5 ways to wellbeing. I thought it might be good to start a conversation on each one of them so.... Today is a potent day. It is the end of a grand cycle in the Mayan Calendar.  The creators of 'Timeless Earth Wisdom' write about today: "As with all completions, a new beginning is heralded; one that signifies our entrance into an emergent unity consciousness that not only honors individuality and duality but requires it in order for there to truly be a wholeness, a unity." I've shared a video clip of a conversation with a Shaman who speaks on the importance of today. It is my hope that we will move from fear into wisdom, from the illusion of separation into an embrace of unity. To learn more about 'Timeless Earth Wisdom' visit:

Is anyone else going to the Presencing Global Forum next week? Hello friends, I have a need. Am co-writing an eBook series on “different work.” Am looking for an introduction to a group that you think I should spend time with. In this case “different work” means 1) a group that, 2) deeply loves their collective work, 3) together are working differently from the way they once believed they should work as individuals, and 4) are significantly redefining what successful work looks and feels like for themselves and/or their communities. Please send me a FB message or email lori@collectiveself.com if you can swing me an introduction to a work group like this. Gratitude. Has anyone tried this new virtual environment for mindmaps, dialogue, etc., called Insight Makers?  http://bit.ly/mpf4ud Just getting back from ContactConference and wanted to share this robust post written Peter Van - it really articulates well our experience and gives some relevant links.

http://petervan.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/contactcon-conference-the-cry-for-freedom/ This is interesting stuff "How does the individual relate to the group in the 21st century?" An interesting analysis of the network of interlocking ownership in global firms. When the team further untangled the web of ownership, it found much of it tracked back to a "super-entity" of 147 even more tightly knit companies - all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity - that controlled 40 per cent of the total wealth in the network. It's unlikely to be a result of some formal conspiracy so much as the natural outgrowth of network dynamics. How to be? Be as simple as you can be; you will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life can become! Paramahansa Yogananda Is anyone else going to the Presencing Global Forum next week?

Let's collaborate! Which is the most traumatic experience in your life? How did you cope with it? New tech can have a downside... even if it wasn't intended to be that way by its designers... Heads up: The Association of Professional Futurists is doing a 24-hour around-the-world video gathering on October 26. It's free, and if you're on this list, you'd probably enjoy it. Link to agenda below.

As part of the Americas section, I'll be presenting my futures research on the American progressive movement as part of the "Sex, Money, And Politics" hour. (We gave this same talk at the World Futures Society gathering a few months ago, and rocked a packed house.) Love to see y'all there. A proposal for anyone who supports the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Global Revolutions of the Arab Spring, Greece, Spain, and elsewhere.

Let's put some resources together to help build some very specific tools which can be used to weather the harsh winter and to bypass the ridiculous laws of NYC not letting the protestors use tents or loudspeakers. Or for other winter places with similar restrictions.

We'll need some people with Android and iOS App development experience, clothing design experience, and tent-making experience (if possible, someone from a boutique tent manufacturer would be ideal).

First, I propose an Android and iPhone App, Swarm Speaker, that simply relays whatever is spoken into one phone to all the others when a "mic button" is pressed. That way all they'll need to do is to run the App and the other connected phones will relay the voice immediately. Problem solved. The apps would need to run off the local network to keep latencies low enough and consistent among the devices to avoid echos.

The NYC certainly wouldn't confiscate the cell phones of a small group of peaceful citizens listening to an internet audio broadcast. Would they?

Anyone interested in helping write this, let me know. Anyone know who has experience programming iPhone or Android Apps, would be especially useful.

For the harsh winter, I propose that we design very stylish new coats. Long coats that have stiff poles in them that can be extended 7 or 8 feet into the air. These coats will be designed to zip and velcro together to make the walls of a mobile hexayurt. They'll come equipped with a hood extension that extends out over the top of the wearer and that also zips together. A large but legal-sized umbrella with a long pole will fit in the center and velcro together with the 6 side coats to make a hexayurt teepee. They'll also have some hidden super powers and look very futuristic when worn unextended.

The NYC certainly wouldn't deprive anyone of their winter coats in the middle of winter. Would they? 

I and a portion of the protesters and those who support them have started the new religion of the Sacred We. ;-) For us, these coats are "communing coats" and they are an important part of our religious practice of fellowship and an open circle of friendship to experience the We. Our religion also has a strong belief in the need to document the world so everyone can see "what is truth," so the coats are be capable of carrying computers, video cameras, and assorted equipment and keeping them safe from the rain. And we can connect more than one communing circle together into a large interlocking mesh of hexagons. The extensions to our poles are antennae that channel the power of the Sacred We to each of the adherents in the communing, they are not mere decoration, but an important part of the worship itself. Communing is also an ongoing continuous process that may last days or weeks or months or years, depending only on how the spirit touches the group communing. So you never know how long we'll need to keep the communing hexayurt teepees up. The hexayurt is a sacred symbol to us.

Further, the religion preaches peace, and embraces all religious traditions, especially and including atheism. So we invite all others into our communing circles to commune with us. We even like to offer service to others in our tents, food, help, and whatever else others might need. This is also part of our sacred tradition.

The NYC certainly wouldn't deprive any religious adherents of their sacred implements of worship. Or interrupt a religious service. Would they?

Now imagine the news story as these coats are handed out to a group of new religious adherents and they march to Liberty Square (Zucotti Park) just as the winter starts setting in and everyone is convinced the crowds will thin out because of the biting cold.

It will be great fun to watch.

cc: Vinay Gupta (creator of the original hexayurt) and Liz McLellan (can we get any Burning Man makers to help with this?) Dear extraordinary folk who happen to hike,

We've had a lot of fun the last few hikes. Therefore, we're getting more organized and have planned more hikes. 

We have scheduled the following: 

Sunday the 23rd of October 2pm (We will begin at La Coppa Coffee, 2 Miller Ave Mill Valley, CA 94941, (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lacoppa-coffee-mill-valley), we will then head to the trail together thereafter on Mt. Tam). Eve Blossom, Illya Zhitomirskiyi, Stamos Venios, Bobby & David will be co-hosts among others. 

Friday 11th of November Marin-- 12pm (noon)-- meet at coffee-  (We will begin at La Coppa Coffee, 2 Miller Ave Mill Valley, CA 94941, (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lacoppa-coffee-mill-valley), we will then head to the trail together thereafter on Mt. Tam)

Thursday 17th of November in San Francisco - 4pm-- Meet at the Legion of Honor

If you would like to co-host a hike, please add your name at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmQfhAjsxaIGdFZvTVZDUVJzbGtvZUQwSlYyVXFfMUE&hl=en_US#gid=0

We have created a Google Group for people who want to keep good track of our hiking going forward. The Google group is only for people we already trust: http://groups.google.com/group/hiking-to-the-next-level?hl=en

We have also created a Meetup group. This is not an open meetup- i.e. strangers have to formally apply to join the group and we have so far only been accepting a small percentage of applicants. I do think it helps us though to over time bring in a subset of folks interested in meeting us. There have been some great folks already who have applied to join us through this means. We won't invite them to all the hikes, but over time we can build trust with new folks as well. If you would like to help us get the word out to the broader community, join the meetup group (and identify on the application to  join the group that you are "Of Bobby" or "Of David" or "Of The Next Edge" so that we no to accept the folks who are already trusted into that digital gathering point)- http://www.meetup.com/The-Next-Level-Up-Hiking-Towards-Better-Worlds/?a=wm1&rv=wm1&ec=wm1

I found it a very helpful dissection of corruption, power and systems. I am headed down to check out OWS now, but please feel free to call me or text at my cell number 517-974-6451 if you are in Manhattan and want to meet up tonight. (if you text, please let me know who you are in text) Hey guys, we're hosting an intergenerational dialogue on activism and social change on November 1st @SFU Woodwards. Among the panelists: Judy Rebick, Phil Fontaine, Jamie Biggar, John Richardson, Andrea Reimer. Musical performance by Aidan Knight. http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=286057514740478 The registration for the 2012 Transpersonal Psychology Conference, "Spirituality: Promises and Pitfalls" is now open.

(Limited volunteer positions are available for discounts and opportunities, stay tuned!) "Nearly all of my socially liberal design students at Parsons support Occupy Wall Street and, at the same time, want to launch their own startup businesses. And that is where the role of design in capitalism is becoming ever more important. The new surge in startup culture among the young, the turn of design toward new business, not just big business and the overall collision of creativity with capitalism now under way, is the best way for us to rebuild our country. This will require reframing capitalism as the space for creators, not traders, for risk-takers, not risk managers, for community-builders, not destroyers. " Here is more reading on food, from The Guardian, UK:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/19/gm-crops-insecurity-superweeds-pesticides David Brooks, in today's NYTimes, points to a way that #OWS could quickly gain far more public visibility and support – by spreading innovations for job creation http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/opinion/the-great-restoration.html?ref=opinion .  

Coincidentally, another NYT columnist today mentions a new crowdfunding initiative for this: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/opinion/nocera-we-can-all-become-job-creators.html?_r=1&ref=opinion ...

Perhaps Chris Cook's ideas on unitisation (revenue-sharing) for restarting economies, as an alternative to Starbucks' debt-driven model for jobs growth, could be among the innovations seeded by Occupiers?

Devin Balkind's and Chris's related ideas on local land-based currencies might be a natural starting point for unitisation ventures in economically-distressed areas, where municipal and other owners of vacant properties convey them as land grants to new bootstrap ventures.  cc Sam Rose what might a currency built upon gratitude look like? I am allowed to invite up to 4 people to this "impact investing" event organized by the UN Global Compact. It's in San Francisco on Tuesday Nov 1st.  Please let me know ASAP if you're interested. Best to use a private message, since I'll need to give them your complete contact info.

http://ungcus.case.edu/events/2011/11/01/un-global-compact-us-network-fall-symposium-impact-investing/ Thank you all. Warming heart and spirit. The idea that a currency should support what is "highest and best" in us (by individual aspiration) sounds beautiful.
If it is as high as the moon - beautiful. I am going outside to do some star-gazing now. Following up on Jordan's post about Euro-foresight: 

One of the things I dreamed of doing when I got a few hundred future-minded people together in the same place was to get them into some kind of prediction market, to see if it might be possible for us to get the news in advance. 

Does anyone here have experience with such markets? Who would like to play? I'm headed back out to the occupy boston camp soon for their general assembly. very impressed with how they are progressing and evolving past just protesting. and the wide representation of views, age, race and soci economy backgrounds. For those on this group that where looking for practical ways to move things forward. they have set up an ideas working group and are encouraging all to write their 30 second pitches on what they see wrong, what solutions do they have or pitch an idea or help developed one here http://occupyboston.wikispaces.com/Strategies%2C+Proposals%2C+Positions Viewing the Occupy Wall Street 'Consensus' video brought this question to mind. Pretty eloquent. We're getting good media out of this. for NextEdgers in London...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UxBLfAC0sME Suresh Fernando and I have a series of articles on Shareable this week about crowdfunding.  Here's one of them... all the others are linked to it's table of contents.

http://www.shareable.net/blog/best-practices-for-crowdfunding-campaigns in line with Joe Brewer and Timothy Rayner this occurred to me as to where we are headed as a nation. the tea party, ows, a banker, a senator.. walk into a bar... We can either have an epic bar brawl and trash the place or we can sit down over beers and conversation and truly create a more perfect union. one thanks the economy. the other makes it solid (and liquid) My latest article... inspired by Timothy Rayner's great piece from earlier this week.  Would love to hear your thoughts!

http://www.chaoticripple.com/2011/occupy-wallstreet-swarm-behavior-and-self-organized-criticality/ Thank you to all NE who have contributed to the creation of this piece. Love to you all. Have fun in ContactCon. I will be doing my little part in for the True, good and beautiful! What use is vision in a chaotic environment? Mark Gunther echoes Joel Makower's "there are no hopeful, compelling stories of sustainable futures." They're both dead wrong, imho. 

Please help me out some of with your favorite (& robust) examples. (Story summaries, links, etc)  Thanks! 

(At the GreenBiz Innovation Forum #GrnBz) Intention and actuality - how big is the gap? What factors enhance congruent behaviors and organizations? What gets in the way? What supports bio-friendly social systems?

Here is a starting example, which I hope you'll find entertaining and stimulating:

"Contraindicated: Why volunteering for a health promotion organization is bad for your health", on http://samika.co/blog Maybe you'll recognize me ;-) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-BCpRVkcBM&feature=youtu.be The other point of view (the ones who clearly don't have any major illness and who avoided investing in anything intangible, like education). Their message: "I've got enough, get over yourself." The conflict to me seems to be specifically over what constitutes a wise investment and and how to make decisions re: personal v. social benefit/risk management. I think we (the US) need to unpack that specific conversation in a respectful way. Does anybody has a doubt about how neoliberal schooling is being exported? The market fundamentalism is just more business and a human right crime. Again, this is going to be a crucial week. Richard LoGatto and Jamie Hanley host an evening of yoga on the farm, meditation, and bonfires. Perfect for purging those mangled city vibes. http://ow.ly/6ZFzY Anybody know?

 http://contactcon.com/participants/venessa-miemis i just saw Dorai Thodla tweet: Go on field trips, make stuff, hatch crazy ideas, and be awed by the world on a daily basis. http://t.co/f8hzQGZf #innovation People are now being arrested for trying to close their big banks account? NYPD is really getting out of hand. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6svA6Qvq1U&feature=colike I wonder if someone could deploy a mindmap version of this group. (I find it impossible to keep up with the volume, pace and richness of the conversation, and would be nice to see it in a broader frame.) 

PS: A hyperlinked mindmap would be nice. ;-) this is pretty rad. http://www.occupytheboardroom.org would love to see some real shareholder activism and have shareholders writing these guys with redress of grievances and solutions for how begin fixing things. also like a B Corp 12 step program to recovery and health. For the last few years many in our community have been practicing elemental arts as a form of dancing on the next edge. If you are anywhere near Los Angeles next weekend I'd love to hear your thoughts on energy education at this once-in-a-lifetime Malibu retreat. Dancing with 10ft arcs of electricity is just the beginning....how do you see extraordinary experiences sparking transformation of our communities? Why does money have so much power? To see a frontier is already to be beyond it. Martin Heidegger India: Some politicians in power are in prison along with corporate top executives. Former ministers in a state and a chief minister of another state have been arrested. I see a cooling down of the public anger. The arrested will soon be out on bail and spend the next decade drawing out the court cases and tying it all up in knots. 
The protests across the world including the US are largely being viewed with detachment. Egypt evoked some excitement and perhaps inspired our own anti-corruption movement. Wonder what OWS will do when it noticeably flares up and trickles down to the other corners of the world. More Alpha Lo wisdom on plurality of intents. I can't resist posting this here - There's something happening here - I've captured Tom Friedman's heart - and, no it's not what you think it is - it's the Big Shift that will take us to the Next Edge http://www.pantedmonkey.org/

This is the beginning of the crowd taking responsibility for our own messaging for the future. http://loudsauce.com/campaigns/49-help-this-occupy-video-reach-millions-of-americans-on-tv http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGRXCgMdz9A My take on the Occupy phenomenon. http://www.coalitionblog.org/2011/10/swarm-wall-street-why-an-anti-political-movement-is-the-most-important-force-on-the-planet/ "In the ’60s we dreamed of uniting people of all races and collar colors into “one big working class.” But it took the billionaires to make it happen." "We want jobs!"   What a stupid message!!! 

Please don't put that on your cardboard... This is the message of the revolted slave! "We want jobs" means that we consider ourselves powerless and beg those who we recognize as being superior to us for the means of our subsistence. 

"Stop looking for a job and start working now!"   That is our message. Commons-based peer-production systems like SENSORICA, i.e. open and decentralized value networks, are the new economical institutions. They empower the individual and strengthen our communities. Don't beg for a job, start producing value, if you can't alone share and collaborate with others, and share that value with your peers.     

This is part of the effort to build our new language. for all you San Fran folk OWS now has a hackaton in one of the national  tech epicenters. http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2325537746/efbnen While watching this eloquent professor I was struck with the realization that #OWS might actually turn out to be a a large-scale citizen-led educational (or social learning) project.

http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/occupy-everywhere

Due to my interest in mass collaboration platforms and the timeliness of the OccupyEverwhere movement I`ve been reflecting a bit on the technology layer that we could develop to support occupiers worldwide.

I did some thinking about this problem today and generated the following presentation. This is pretty rudimentary but should be enough to give you a sense of what I am thinking. Due to the fact that we will all be attending Contact it seems like a good idea to get the ideas out there asap! Here are a few of the basic ideas...

OBJECTIVES:
Focus the attention of, and coordinate the resources from, those that want to support the occupiers

Provide an infrastructure that will enable the self organization of a dynamically changing group with ambiguous collective objectives that are occupying a particular geographic location.

Support the maintenance and growth of localized occupations

PRIMARY APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
Mobile: we can expect people in the streets to be moving around etc...

Real Time: needs to be sensitive to the rapidly changing environment

Location Sensitive: the context is one where people are trying to coordinate logistics in particular localized regions

A highly robust GPS/mapping system will need to be at the core of the application framework

PROBLEM TO SOLVE
OESP needs to be able to take a number of discrete inputs from individuals that are not connected, in real time, process this information, and then provide feedback that is relevant to the organization and management of a larger group that has no formal organizational structure. humor du jour. Dear Occupy Wall Street - I have one demand.  A Constitutional Convention.  

One push opens up the whole thing.  The founders put it in there for a reason.  This is it. Just read the most powerful vow of love from Sam Keen's Fire in the Belly:

True love is the only just and holy war. Two friends pledge loyal opposition to one another. I vow I will defend the integrity of my separate being and respect the integrity of your being. 
We will meet only as equals. 
I will present myself to you in the fullness of my being and will expect the same of you.
I will not cower, apologize or condescend.
Our covenant will be to love one another justly and powerfully; to establish and cherish invincible boundaries; to respect our separate sanctuaries.
We will remain joined in the sweet agony of dialogue, the contest of conversation, the dialectic of love united we arrive in synthesis.

Oh, if we only knew how to love with that much self respect . . .the world would truly be different.

Love & light,
Jennifer Curtis Faith how is the resource building for OWS? the more i talk with folks on the outside looking and follow the activity. the more i feel action needs to gel. I'm both a strong supporter or ows and a fan of capitalism and while I don't really like the anti capitalism signs and chants at ows i get the frustration behind them. one thing that caught my eye today was there was a food cart festival set for this weekend in Boston in the same place as ows is camping so it has been moved. with strong backlash at how ows is now negatively affecting small business. which is not so cool. and make it easier for the spin doctors at faux news to paint ows as a dangerous, socialist movement that is bad for the struggling economy and is killing jobs.  This i why i keep thinking how to befriend not just the police but also the small biz folks by show casing practical solutions. by helping the small biz innovate or in someway show that  ows is not about protesting the success of others who work hard to build value. that ows is a friend of value creators and a friend of the economy. that we don't just have drum circles and complains on cardboard but that we also have a better system than the one we are protesting and calling for a replacement of... with as ben harper said "A better way" almost 900 of us already. wow. i keep feeling that the "What now question" is critical to OWS. many folks asking ok, so you want to tear down the old system. what are you solutions for a replacement? what is ows other than protest? me thinks that helping these movement show the wide range of the solutions from the 99% would get some real traction. a google map showing peeps doing awesome work. a way for folks to join up with them. "a relentless positive storm"  of very visible and tangible works to augment the protest. As a group of people who are very focussed on 'building better futures' - are we being true to ourselves and living in balance? Awesome. The UpTake's #Occupy video aggregator is now up to 61 live feeds (and counting) from Wall Street to such far-flung places as Louisville, KY and Ljubljana, Slovenia! Check it out: http://www.theuptake.org/2011/10/08/occupy-wall-street-live-across-america/ NE member Michel Bauwens will be in Palo Alto, CA at the Institute for the Future on 10/24 for a talk entitled: The Future of Peer Production. Shareable is cohosting. I'll be there, and would love it if you joined me, Michel, and Marina Gorbis of the Institute. It's going huge nerdy fun!: http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-future-of-peer-production-event I made a NextEdge circle on Google+ and shared it. If you pick it up and add people from this group who are on G+, please reshare your expanded version with the circle.

(Note: limited post. You will only be able to see this if you're among the 60 NextEdgers whom I've been able to track down on G+.) We can turn this careening world around. Even by the end of next year. Yes I mean that.

The answer comes from the seemingly crazy assumption that we all have it wrong. All of us. We are all equal. Equally capable. Equally but diversely talented. That's the key, we are a diverse equality.

Some of us have rarer talents but it is a big mistake to use a value weighted index instead of an aggregate value index. A single plumber may not be worth more than a brain surgeon to the community, but taken in aggregate, the value of some number of plumbers certainly does. In terms of quality of life, loss of life, aesthetics, convenience...on many different spectrums. A city without plumbing is much worse for the health of everyone than a city without brain surgeons.

Then there's the old joke about the body parts arguing over which one was more important, when finally the asshole shuts up and ... You get the idea. Even the asshole is important.

So the community is worse off if it values one member over the other at all. This has implications for new economic ideas. We should all receive exactly equal access to shared resources in a way that allows for our own personal preferences to be expressed.

And to cause relative harm to even one of the community, in a mathematical sense even, really does harm the community. So what does the community do about this? Simple, tolerate no harm whatsoever to anyone. No special privilege of any sort. No special position in society.

This is what Equal Rights really means. We've been dancing around it and hemming and hawing, but there you have it. The justification for any structural difference whatsoever becomes the justification for even more, until you end up where we are today. A system out of balance, ugly, and painful.

"15th october: #United we will re-invent the world" http://15october.net/

Incredible! There was the (crazy?) idea of a World Change Forum emerging on August 6 here in TNE group. Orig. thread: http://on.fb.me/n54Yc8. WCF = gathering on eye-level with events like WEF+WSF. For global change. And now something much bigger is just emerging! Be witness to the history before your eyes.
WCF is a necessity in its own. As an annual event of "changemakers with a substance". The movement of OccupyX is about discontent, and this is ok. After this first step viable solutions have to be found! 
As TNE proves the world is full of people with solution concepts, tools, methods, new mindsets!!! They all have a special responsibility to contribute to this still amorphous movement. To co-create the future.
More about WCF event project:
http://wiki.thenextedge.org/doku.php?id=wcf useful tips. Left vs right - a mental prison!   

Let's just admit this! It is time to escape the cognitive entrapment of the left/right paradigm. The TeaParty and the Occupy.* movements are deeply connected. There are superficial differences, slightly different languages are used, because these two very similar movements originated within two camps artificially manufactured by those in power to divide and to control us. 

Before the TeaParty movement got hijacked by corrupt representatives of the Republican party it's message was very clear: "End the FED", end corruption, punish those responsible for the financial crisis, regain the lost individual freedoms, etc. Have we forgotten the "End The Fed" national rally in November 2008? Perhaps some of you don't want to remember this event, because you were still sleeping in 2008, still dreaming... You thought that these people demonstrating in front the "federal" Reserve branches all over the US were crazy. Well, it's time for you to face yourself and to move on. 

As it happened for the TeaParty movement, the Occupy.* movement can also be hijacked and discredited. The core message can be drown in left vs right slogans. The core debate can be shifted back into the same debilitating left/right dichotomy. And the country can again be divided into liberals and libertarians. 

When are we going to wake the fuck up! Look around you, we'are all the same, we're all suffering! 

Ignore the superficial differences we see today. Don't pay attention to the radical solutions that come out from one side or from the other. We've been fed two ways of thinking to produce ideas and solution that can never be reconciled. We've been engineered to disagree with one another; to be incapable to reach a consensus. Our minds need to brake free from this mental prison! We need to build our own language,              a language that unites us; a language through which we can agree on a future for man kind. From the Occupy Dallas page: "Specific Ideas needed to begin engaging in positive community projects to help the 99% who need it most. Someone mentioned inviting disabled veterans for instance." This is a great move for Next Edgers to take up. Now that OWS has had 2 weeks of yelling, protesting and letting out all that bottled up steam it's time to shift to practical action.  This group has a vast and deep global network of doers who have what OWS is missing... tangible practical solutions and better models for how to create a better world. Should we create a Ushahidi map of these projects? How do we use all the bottled up steam of OWS to fuel the engine of Change? The Internet. None of us is secure, none of it belongs to us, none of it is free. Do we own the code? A challenging talk by Mark Pesce at the linux conference Australia last year in Brisbane. What will we do in the next billion seconds? 

Mark Pesce's thesis is that we have relinquished freedom and resilience for efficiency and speed. Can we continue like this. Thoughts? Translated into various languages. So, how might a politician who squarely asserted that corporatocracy is the problem get funded? Apologies for this cross-posting, but I believe this group probably has a high concentration of Bay Area residents:

Dear friends, I just learned my travel funding for the IFTF lecture in San Franciso on Oct 24 fell through, though I would still like to make it there. However, given my current quite dramatic $ situation, I cannot afford to buy the ticket. I'm looking for $300-500 in donations to fund the ticket. For people in the Bay Area who may find it important that I make it there, thanks for considering any assistance. (cc Neal Gorenflo, Marvin T Brown). I do not have a working cc card, so best option is for local people to pre-buy the ticket on  my behalf. Of course, I'm available for any free or donation-based lecture to local groups while in the area. I keep having this feeling that "we" need more face time together. Its not enough to exchange links and see each other for a few afternoons at a conference once a year. I feel like we need to spend a few months straight mapping out the dynamics of the world and finding the highest leverage points and developing an integrated collaborative action "plan." 

Or do I just need to accept the tweet-dimensionality of digital time and learn to squeeze depths into the spaces between? Love these creatures! Artificial life forms. "Illuminated Crowd," sculpture in Montreal.  Walked past it many times, finally stopped today to read what it's about.  Seems to capture the current times.  The plaque says: "A crowd has gathered, facing a light, an illumination brought about by a fire, an event, an ideology - or an ideal. The strong light casts shadows, and as the light moves toward the back and diminishes, the mood degenerates; rowdiness, disorder and violence occur, showing the fragile nature of man. Illumination, hope, involvement, hilarity, irritation, fear, illness, violence, murder and death - the flow of man's emotion through space."   Will the new story that is emerging shine brightly enough to illuminate even the depravity that exists in the shadows (of society... of each of us...)?  What's your take on the sculpture?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBXKhN16tdE&feature=related New blog post: Deracination, a short history bit.ly/poGCgM Heart request for 10 minute NextEdge contributions to inspire 'beauty industry' leaders. 

I am working in setting up collective intelligence springboards to help the perfume/cosmetics industries change. What’s the objective? The “perfect product.” The methodology? Beauty, Goodness, and Truth. 

The form of this effort is very concrete. Jean-François Noubel and I are organizing an event called Centifolia, a congress that will bring together players from the perfumery and cosmetics industries from October 19-21 in France. 

Centifolia is an event unlike any other of its kind. First, participants will hear high-quality “Ninja Speakers” who will present in accordance with the TED conference rules. This is the “Be Inspired” phase. Then, via World Cafés and amazing harvesting techniques, we will maximize and expand the collective intelligence present among the event participants. These are the “Imagine” and “Co-create” phases. 

Last but not least, we will invite the collective intelligence present everywhere in the world, and do so using social media. This is where I am inviting you to contribute. During the conference speakers will emphasize how markets are evolving because we are evolving. They will get interesting facts about cultural creatives, lohas, post moderns. Yet its all boring data, no soul or real voices. I created a voicethread piece with three questions that open the opportunity for decision-makers of the beauty industry to listen and get a real taste of the consciousness leading this new markets.  

 I am requesting that evolutionary consciousness shows up during the congress. We need this prior the conference to present it in different formats.

If you feel the call to contribute here is the voicethread:

You just never know who you'll meet.  Of course, I was in Metropolis (aka NYC)... Does this tell us about what we need to know about social progress? Have many of you used Bre.ad? Very cool site that if used correctly could be hugely influential in how people post to Twitter and shorten URLs, highly recommend checking it out Is there a next edge hashtag for twitter? 
I was thinking of all the links posted in this group and I would presume that there is a lot of links posted on twitter as well. 

If people started to use (are using?) a particular hashtag on twitter that could be monitored and all attached links could be sent to delicious. There you would in an easier way be able to figure out what kind of knowledge that are posted and possessed within the group. 

An alternative would be to monitor all individuals and store all the tweeted links. But that might not always be next edge worthy.

One key finding is that flexibility in our ability to respond to those we lead is key. Though not said, it's probably just as true in regards to responding to those who lead us. 

I've heard lots of definitions of introversion/extroversion, but one of the most useful I've found centers on how we "recharge" - do we seek the company of others, or do we seek solitude...

How do you all see introversion and extroversion playing into our roles as leaders? This is an example of making VISIBLE certain REPRESENTATIONS of a movement that, I believe, serve to further stimulate the movement.

I'm hoping to find some time to write a few posts and share some pretty awesome learning, insights, and ideas over next few weeks. One bit of very good news - we've confirmed a date for Gathering in 2012 - 30 March to 1 April 2012. 
The theme for Gathering '12 (broadly speaking): exploring systems and how we can transform them - locally and globally. Official launch late next month. http://gathering11.net cc Venessa Miemis Jean Russell Michelle James Kate Michi Ettinger John Hagel Jennifer Sertl Whatelse? Lessons for future movements?

He is also the author of a book called The Game of Politics. Here is an interview I conducted with him a couple weeks ago... I'm fascinated by this question. Hi all. This will be my only post on this event here :-)  Just want to let anyone who this might resonate with know about an event happening in Washington, DC on October 23 - the Creativity in Business Conference (www.creativity-conference.com). Designed to cultivate and celebrate the creativity of who is there, it's a day with 12 highly experiential breakout sessions (w/applied improv, storytelling, embodiment, visual thinking, holistic innovation, etc) and 4 interactive discovery-dialogue panels (Creative Leadership, Creative Work Cultures, Creativity and Social Media, and Emergence and Co-creation), followed by an Imagination Festival (w/lots of improv) and a Connectworking reception. 

The conference focus is the integration of creativity, service, commerce and serving the greater good. Several Next Edgers are participating (including Annalie Killain, John Hagel, Peggy Holman, Michael Margolis, George Por and Bruce Watluck). Both content rich and highly interactive, this hope is that people leave feeling more in touch and alive within their own creativity in real time, inspired to structure it out into the world of work, and more informed on ways to engage that. It is an event for 150 people, and there are only 11 spaces remaining. If this calls to you, hope to see you there. I've been thinking a lot lately about the power of Internet memes as new mythical heros. How these characters allow people to tell stories and share culture using an established character that isn't owned by any corporation but is free to the commons to use as a mouthpiece.

No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it! - Einstein so a thought just came to me, and i'd like to know what you think:
Mark Pesce is right, the world has changed right under our noses. Smart phones have deeply shifted our fundamental relationships of interaction with the world. A phone has shifted from: a thing in fixed location that allows me to talk to 1 other person, a simple communication device - to: a mechanism by which to access the collective intelligence of the human species in a realtime manner, wherever i am, with full contextualized geographic knowledge, a device that embeds me in the world in an entirely different way.

All best, Cassie Robinson Ethical markets awards. http://www.euroscapes.info/ I want to build a knowledge Inventory of all the World's people using a decimal classification system (like Dewey) for machine usability, boolean operations, and predictive analysis. What would be the top 10 categories? Here are some candidates that I've been pondering: Art, Science, Communication, Spirituality, Community, Culture, Environment...  We'll work on sub-categories later...any thoughts? Hi Next Edge!

The future is now. The edge is already here. A must read for us 'Next Edgers' by Naomi A Klein. She sees past the Occupy Wall Street to the deeper, and greater revolution of which we are all a part: http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-most-important-thing-world-now Hello Next Edgers, I'm curious what our collective minds knows and/or thinks about the "food commons" ideas in this recent Slow Food article. How do such commons effective take back the food system? What tools and resources exist to accelerate such changes?

"A food commons is not only a physical place where food is produced, processed, sold or consumed; it is also a social space where decisions are made in the interest of the common good. Whenever food activists take back a part of the food system in the interest of the common good, they are constructing a food commons. This is why food sovereignty as an organizing concept and precondition for food justice, food democracy and the right to food is so important: it implies a space that is sovereign to the corporate food regime. It is a space in which people—not corporations—decide." I love us. We just turned 888.

The Social Innovators Collective is a dynamic, energetic network of emerging leaders in the social enterprise and nonprofit sectors.
www.socialinnovatorscollective.org For those of you going to Contactcon in NYC on October 20th (I'll be there), here's some of the projects that will be on tap as well as the spirit: http://shareable.net/blog/10-projects-to-liberate-the-web

What other similar projects do you know of? Here is a debategraph map of The Living WE. 

http://debategraph.org/TheLivingWe

The Living WE started with a paper I wrote for Gathering 11 in Melbourne last June, with a name and unifying concept inspired by We Magazine. It is the result of almost a year of conversations and research. More than an inspiration paper, I wrote it as an outline of the characteristics and ingredients required to create the conditions under which transformative action can be inspired, empowered and enabled, in view of a metamorphosis of our current paradigms, systems, processes and practices. 

I proposed it as a track of work several weeks ago. I think we are ready to start the exploration of how we can bring it to life or activate it. 

I also proposed it as a framework or part of the framework of the Next Edge book that is being discussed in the group dedicated to the book.

Please let me know if you are interested to collaborate on one or the other. Now that the global public spotlight is on one of the main issues that many of us in The Next Edge are focused on, how do we get our content out? How do we show the world that we've already made some valuable headway in creating pathways to positive futures? The Occupy Wallstreet folks have chosen to try and build consensus from among the participants about what their goals are. Is this approach simply naivety? Or, is it a relatively new worldview and fundamental assumption about how to solve problems of human co-governance that has been trying to be born for several decades now? Very sorry to note the passing away of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. May His soul rest in peace. What a wonderful innovator & inventor! “They're chickens, you dolt! They don’t plot, they don’t scheme, and they are *NOT* *ORGANIZED*!” The practical: a friend of mine in Ireland needs some help (ideally in the form of a job).  He is a photographer, videographer and top noch editer/mixer.  Anyone have network in Ireland I can connect him into? Tiberius Brastaviceanu and myself want to support the OccupyWallStreet initiative by actually occupying Wall Street during the time we are in NY for ContactCon. This means that we want to spend the nights in NY on the streets with the protestors. Are there others that want to join us?

Are there those in NY that have tents and camping gear that would support us and others wanting to camp on Wall Street? Search volume from Google: 
Blue is "occupy wall street" - red is "tea party."

Note how search volume far exceeds, news volume. Mainstream media is seriously lagging behind people's actual interest in this topic. What do people here think of Zeitgeist? "What is consciousness, and how do we explain it from an evolutionary perspective? According to this author, it is the brain anticipating events in the world before they happen. "The brain is not a marvelous computer in any classical sense - we can barely manage a seven-digit span, but it is a phenomenally sensitive anticipator of environmental and behavioral change. Subjective consciousness has its survival value in enabling us to jump out of the way when a tiger is about to strike, not so much in computing which path the tiger might be on, (because this is an intractable problem, and the tiger can also take it into account in avoiding the places we would expect it to most likely be), but by intuitive conscious anticipation." Be one of the first to pledge to a LoudSauce campaign to #Occupy the digital billboard on the Bay Bridge. Let's put our money (and our FB icon) in support of those on the streets. 

http://loudsauce.com/campaigns/48-let-s-occupy-a-digital-billboard-on-the-sf-bay-bridge-for-the-99 "Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee." - Helen Keller "It has always seemed strange to me...the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.

                                                      John Steinbeck" Fascinating insights. Via Michel Bauwens Mushin Schilling. "We have to make sure that the de-centralization we are fostering actually empowers those who aren’t already conditioned by this society to speak a lot and lead and give directions." Today, this occupation will look quite a bit different. A number of unions and others organizations will be joining the protest. From a just-released global Sustainability Survey: 

"According to experts, no sector is managing the transition to sustainable development effectively; all 17 sectors are perceived as net negative"

"Yet the [sense of] urgency... has declined since 2009"

http://surveys.globescan.com/tss11-2/images/KeyChallenges_and_IndustryPerformance_TSS_2011.pdf

This is extremely disturbing, though it doesn't come as a surprise. To me, it points to the need to move beyond the concept of sustainability - which is a great start but ultimately isn't compelling enough - to something like the concept of thrivability.  I wrote an article last year about the difference between the two concepts: Is Sustainability Serving the Wrong Master? http://www.solarium.cambiumconsulting.com/content/sustainability-serving-wrong-master

Help us spread the buzz!!! I would like us to take a look at the big picture. Take a look at what is going on at the global level, occupations in israel, across the US, around europe, and the middle east, coupled with extreme weather events, Germany's renunciation of nuclear power, etc.

Live Q&A: Networking for social entrepreneurs, Thursday 6 October, 1-3pm (not sure if this is 1 pm UK time, but probably - you can ask Gines, the organizer).

How do you meet those interested in supporting your social enterprise?  Many successful social entrepreneurs have prospered because of the connections they have made, and a recent poll on our network suggests that many of you think that 'contacts' - which can be enhanced by networking - are important to success in social enterprise.  But developing and maintaining contacts and personal connections could be challenging. 

How could you improve your networking skills and extend your reach?  In this week's Q&A we will consider:
• Where to network
• Offline and online networking resources
• Strategies and techniques

http://bit.ly/BeyondCapitalismANewGame 

This is a VERY insightful description of why the old economic system no longer works and how to set the stage for the new one. 

I believe our TNE group can value greatly from its study. Glenda Eoyang is founder of the 'Human Systems Dynamics Institute' and I highly recommend her work and her HSDI community, found at http://www.hsdinstitute.org/ 

Many insights about how to move into the next economy, which is not material-based but knowledge-based, including a couple of my favorites: "economic depression as, “after the old rules stop working and before the new ones emerge", … "Knowledge only has value when it is given away", and "…success in this new world won’t look like success in the old, but failure won’t either". 

My complements to Glenda and her HSDI organization. A must read.

Tom Friedman in today's NYTimes on the downdraft in prices for skilled work - 

>>Matt Barrie, is the founder of freelancer.com, which today lists 2.8 million freelancers offering every service you can imagine. “The whole world is connecting up now at an incredibly rapid pace,” says Barrie, and many of these people are coming to freelancer.com to offer their talents. Barrie says he describes this rising global army of freelancers the way he describes his own team: “They all have Ph.D.’s. They are poor, hungry and driven: P.H.D.”

>>Barrie offered me a few examples on his site right now: Someone is looking for a designer to design “a fully functioning dune buggy.” Forty people are now bidding on the job at an average price of $268. Someone is looking for an architect to design “a car-washing cafe.” Thirty-seven people are bidding on that job at an average price of $168...” Someone looking for “a rap song to help Chinese students learn English” has three bids averaging $157.   (full article: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-did-the-robot-end-up-with-my-job.html )

These are still early days for eBay-style markets for knowledge-based services. As tens – or hundreds – of millions of new free agents pour into global reverse auction telework markets, with skills "levelled up" to international standards by free online learning and certification/badge-earning resources, we'll likely lead to a great downdraft in salary levels for knowledge-based services in the developed world.

In my view, this reinforces the likelihood of an implosion in the overleveraged economies of developed nations. As unemployment rates rise in the private sector, and corporations lose ground to the rising P2P labor-of-love ventures, tax revenues will plunge, and public sector workforces also will decline sharply. 

The sooner Next Edgers can offer personal and community currency alternatives, and help community awaken local assets for sustainability, the better.  

I also hope we can turn the "race to the bottom" in prices of telework services to building a global digital Commons for grassroots benefit. Here's one way it might happen  - http://upliftacademy.org/wiki/index.php?title=GAP2007Essay#Engaging_Global_Talent_for_Good_Causes In an excellent article on the necessary recasting of the globalization narrative published in the World Financial Revue this week Dani Rodrik points out to the fundamental political trilemma of the world economy: 

"we cannot simultaneously pursue democracy, national determination, and economic globalization. If we want to push globalization further, we have to give up either the nation state or democratic politics. If we want to maintain and deepen democracy, we have to choose between the nation state and international economic integration. And if we want to keep the nation state and self-determination, we have to choose between deepening democracy and deepening globalization. Our troubles have their roots in our reluctance to face up to these ineluctable choices."

Where do you think we are heading?

http://www.worldfinancialreview.com/?p=704 This is a research paper by Nunn and Wantchekon. They are linking levels of trust with historical incidence of slave trade in african countries. For people interested in international development, this will surely be a good and insightful read. Trust is an important factor for development of civic society in any country, and presence of healthy civic society is beneficial for different reasons. What I will like to check is whether this mistrust led to weaker civic society or not, meanwhile taking other factors into account. What can be other variable that might be playing some role according to you? A remarkable Joanathan. It is quite a journey to work for the evolution of consciousness and the tools to support it.

Marc Mathieu, have you though of connecting the intrapreneurship you shared with me in the context of Danon (for holistic social and economic ecosystem resurgence in which each element of production tied to a different socially responsible goal) with socially responsible product marketing via trust economy? In other words, could the right trust networks connect to responsible ecosystem stewardship as consumers and hyper-influencers (i.e. these hundred products will sustain x species habitats, y bio-diversity gains, z human social impact, q extra people through school etc. Getting a diffuse community to take responsibility via trust networks for systemic impact is something Jerry Michalski has been sharing lovely research on with an empathetic thinking  work group alongside a theoretical framework for accelerating trust based upward spiral/virtuous cycle network effects.

SATURDAY, OCT 15TH - BERKELEY

Bay Area Integral is thrilled to announce that Ken Wilber, the foremost Integral pioneer and philosopher of our time, has graciously agreed to do special live public dialog (NOTE: KEN WILL BE ON LIVE AUDIO ONLY). This unprecedented event, in which Ken will be present via live audio, will be an opportunity to come together with this genius who has inspired and awakened so many of us, and who defined the space in which our community coalesced.

Ken conceived this event with Terry Patten, who will host and facilitate the day. We’ll spend the morning and early afternoon together exploring a central topic of Integral practice — Inquiry: the process of participating in questions that open consciousness beyond limited perspectives. Inquiry practice is intrinsic to Integral consciousness, and is the ground from which both higher stages and higher states of consciousness emerge. Ken will guide us in that fruitful practice, and he’ll also share how he learned it and how his own practice has evolved, drawing us into the ineffable living process of self-recognition, open intelligence, and intuitive freedom.

After our conversation with Ken, we’ll practice the inquiry he’ll catalyze and deepen in both our individual consciousness, and also together in our intersubjective we-space. By opening to the larger field of our shared awareness, we’ll not only evolve personally, but we’ll also awaken and coalesce our community through the inquiry practice.

Please join us! You’re invited to bring your open mind and heart, your sincere inquiring mind, and your willingness to stretch, transform, and evolve.

The event will be held at the beautiful Rudramandir space at 830 Bancroft Way at 6th Street in Berkeley on Saturday, October 15 from 8:30am to 3:30pm.

Registration:

    * Advance Registration (strongly recommended*): http://baiwilberpattenoct15.eventbrite.com: $60 regular, $50 student
    * At the door: $65 regular, $50 student

* Given how rarely Ken does these kinds of public events, we expect to sell out, so we strongly recommend advance purchase of tickets.

Ken Wilber, who has been called “the Einstein of consciousness”, is the world’s leading integral philosopher. He is the most widely translated academic writer in America, with 25 books translated into some 30 foreign languages, and is the first philosopher-psychologist to have his Collected Works published while still alive. His many books, all of which are still in print, include Integral Spirituality; No Boundary; Grace and Grit; Sex, Ecology, Spirituality; and the “everything” books: A Brief History of Everything (one of his largest selling books) and A Theory of Everything (probably the shortest introduction to his work). His Integral Theory integrates Western science, Eastern mysticism and postmodern psychology and philosophy, laying the foundations of a new, comprehensive view on consciousness and the world. Integral philosophy is now a worldwide movement which is rapidly becoming a powerful presence in fields as diverse as politics and spirituality, psychology and business, medicine, and art.

Terry Patten is a leading voice in the emerging fields of integral evolutionary practice, leadership and spirituality. He speaks and consults internationally—inspiring, challenging, and connecting leaders and institutions worldwide. Terry has worked for over three decades as a philosopher, activist, coach, and teacher. He was a part of the core team at Integral Institute that developed Integral Life Practice and was the senior writer and co-author, with Ken Wilber, of Integral Life Practice: A 21st-Century Blueprint for Physical Health, Emotional Balance, Mental Clarity, and Spiritual Awakening. He hosts the acclaimed online teleseminar series Beyond Awakening: The Future of Spiritual Practice where he engages leading-edge conversations bringing higher consciousness to human affairs with dozens of the best-known thinkers and spiritual teachers of our time. In 2008 he founded Bay Area Integral, the San Francisco nexus of the budding international Integral movement. This is brilliant!

He goes on to say: "It (empathy) has become a way to experience delicious moral emotions without confronting the weaknesses in our nature that prevent us from actually acting upon them. It has become a way to experience the illusion of moral progress without having to do the nasty work of making moral judgments."

Root Alliance enables social enterprises to partner with local NGOs and
grassroots organizations and to understand local contexts better so that
they can develop more appropriate products and services for the poor around
the world. We build a network of partners in developing countries by
identifying local organizations with proven track records and deep
connections to local communities, and providing them with capacity building
training to strengthen their ability to work with social enterprises. Then
we match social enterprises with the best possible local partners, helping
them build effective relationships so that they can conduct in-depth
research on the ground. Root alliance is launching its first field office in
India.

Quirky (community product design, with shared spoils) fascinates me more every time I revisit it. http://aquirkyblog.com/ REGARDING THE eBOOK AUTHORING … There doesn't seem to be enough 'make-it-happen' desire to move toward the writing/mapping of an eBook (or whatever you want to call it), or am I missing something? I'm bummed because there seemed to be a lot of energy around it. Momentum grew, people stepped up to help with certain aspects, and then things began to shut down. As I see it, our intellectual well-trained minds began to do what we've been taught, which is to become critics (giving opinions) rather than inquirers (asking deep questions with intent). I saw that people were interested in talking and giving points of view, but not willing to commit to an actual collaborative design process whose outcome is to actually build something together that goes beyond the dialog – generative dialogs, rather than just interactive discussions. If this group is only about dialog and conversation, that's terrific – it's VERY important. But I was hearing another message coming through the voices of this list. As for me, I am loving the conversations but am also looking for conversations that are 'generative'. In other words, ideas fractal off and become sub–communities that include the creation of technologies to make for a better world. Note I'm using the word technology in a broader sense than normally used .. I believe that 'ALL' communities emerge and sustain based on the relationships that form. And 'all' communities have technology, which I define as creations that extend our individual humanity to satisfy our insatiable desire to connect – This is a Sacred act (and is actually what the word 'Religion' originally meant – religio means to connect). But I'm not seeing this happen here. Rather I am seeing old ways of thinking and behavior that keep us locked away from performing any kind of action beyond beyond emails that reach our in-bins. 

I would very much like to move into a 'generative dialog' about this subject specifically (ie constructive vs destructive group behaviors), where the gut (as I defined it before relative to head and heart) of the matter is permitted in, and we see what comes out. I think this is a VERY important dialog to have if we are truly going to build the world that we are defining. Is anyone interested? Vic :) We've started the Free/Libre/Open-source (FLO) Solutions group at Occupy Wall St because we want everyone to have access to the tools and technologies they need to create the world they want.  The mission of our group is to spread awareness about FLO solutions (ex. Linux), and provide equipment, training, documentation and support to people developing and deploying FLO solutions.

The news seems to suggest that things are going very bad, and I think that there are some financial measures that NGOs and social enterprises can do (financially) to prepare themselves for a repeat. I am moved by the Occupy Wall Street protests...so much so, that I wanted to come up publicly with my strong support for why these protests matter so much to the United States. 

The media has kept this stuff pretty well hidden, though that's starting to break down. If you agree with what I'm saying in this HuffPo piece, please help me get it out there. one for Mark Frazier Devin Balkind Tiberius Brastaviceanu Graham Leicester & Jerry Michalski Walking Away From Empire " ... the book is a radical call to action like no other"..... might be some ideas here we can bring into this fold?

http://bit.ly/eBook-Authors cc Jordan Greenhall - looks like one Dylan Ratigan is riding this horse hard. In this bubble capitalism, have look who is the driver. Remember, this is a brutal as it can get at this moment... the police knows that they are fighting a media/information war. They know that they cannot misbehave in front of hundreds of cameras. The Multitude is recording the history this time! 

Unfortunately I expect the tension to mount in the coming weeks, to the point of dangerously degenerating. We already see the negative feedback loop in operation. Listen to the language, look at the actions...

I PROPOSE to create a WALL OF SHAME: gather faces of police officers who arrest protesters from videos and pictures already published on the internet and to publish them on Flickr with a specific tag, for example #occupywallstreetpolice There is an interesting article on the world-wide protests - front page of New York Times, drawing the parallels and suggesting a lack of faith in voting - summarising it suggests people believe it doesn't matter who they vote for, the politicians aren't acting on their behalf. 

Its noticable that there is little mention of a lack of trust in voting in the US - probably the least democratic/most corrupt of western democracies. Maybe a Fox-News educated population isn't critically analysing its own system.

There is zero mention of Occupy Wall Street - I'm not sure whether this is a sign of either: a conspiracy; that the protest is tiny (compared to elsewhere in the world); or that the protesters are too unorganised to be working the media well; or some combination of all three. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/world/as-scorn-for-vote-grows-protests-surge-around-globe.html?_r=1&nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha2 I'll manage the process of getting the TNE ebook developed. 

There are many steps, but please don't ask for heady details right now. I suggest you jump in with your heart and not your head at this early stage .. and tell your own gut to shut up for a bit, as it will stop most of you from moving forward. 

Once we get at least 33 of the 875 people on the TNE group to make a commitment to write, I will move to the next step of managing the process, and then the next. I will make the process open for input and group approval when that time comes. 

First we need to gather the subjects of interest. Which of you, within this incredible collective mind called 'the next edge' TNE, is willing to make a commitment to write a one to two page white paper on your subject(s)? There are no limits to what you write about at this stage, so don't ask, just commit. 

If you are in, please send me 1-your full name, 2-a direct email, and 3-a draft description of your subject (one to two lines of text), and I will post on a page for all to see. Please email your request to BOTH this Facebook TNE group and to me Vic at TNE@DiscoveryFuel.com . 

Okay? WHO's IN?
Vic I love this guy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g. We need to start giving social capital. The Occupy Wall Street people need food.  I just placed a huge order with the local pizza place that is helping feed them.  They take orders online by credit card and let you pick the day and time of delivery.  I invite the people here to organize a food donation effort, perhaps by contacting @OccupyWallSt on Twitter. I think I've got tomorrow (Wednesday) covered for lunch w/ 12 assorted pies, 10 calzones and 20 bottles of water.  Here's the pizza place's web site. 

http://www.liberatospizza.com/ If, hypothetically, we know that the Occupy Wall Street folks had enough momentum to maintain the 'occupation' indefinitely, what sort of collaboration infrastructure would we need to scale this phenomenon across the nation? What would this mean? The internet makes their activity Persistently Visible and therefore provides us with a source of ongoing inspiration... It could be enough to galvanize people across the country...across the world... but what should we do and how should we do it? technical question to bring me to the next edge on documenting a women center project proposal i am in-charge > how build a hyperlink in google doc to a content in the same page?

Hi Next Edgers - I have posted semi-frequently on here, but generally speaking, I really just enjoy taking all of your inspiration in. So first up, thank you! 

I was just wondering what you all think of the current state of play with regards to the 'whole lifecycle' of idea to action. From what I can tell, there's a great deal of support for ideas that have achieved 'proof of concept' and are now ready for VC / Angel Investment - but little support for the inventors/ideators amongst us. 

Am I off the mark? Examples I can give are Y-Combinator, Unreasonable Institute, and I believe TechCrunch has one now too. My suggestion: before we start solving and discussing huge issues of system changes we should get our egos out (collectively) and learn to meet each other on a human way. Everything else will follow if we build up values, trust and joy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpk5Z7GIFs Why Resistance Detests Groups: Studies show the power in group dynamics. Let's use this information to help us move through the incredible resistance that most of us are feeling, both internally and externally, as global-change agents, .
http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/resistance-detests-groups/ I have a question.  Geoff Mulgan, one-time head of policy for Tony Blair in the UK government, remarked on leaving post that 'governments typically overestimate what they can achieve in the short term and underestimate what they can achieve in the long term'.  Seems like a truism when you think about it. 

But why (beyond the obvious:  electoral cycles, 'successful innovation always looks like failure in the middle') do you think this is so?  [if it is!] Changed my status to saying a cartography of overlapping aspirations is a part of the map that needs to be built. Next Edge could help build a meta level of the map like that.

For those who don't have time to read the whole thing, here's the last 2 paras. "The bias lurking behind every large-scale smart city is the belief that bottom up complexity can be bottled and put to use for top-down ends--that a central agency could one day manage and even dictate the complex needs of an actual city.  Instead [he says, as New Yorkers learned in the 1960s and 70s] the smartest cities are the ones that embrace open-ness, andomness and serendpity--everything that makes a city great. The marketization of knowledge, our knowledge. This oligopoly structure is a must change for a free knowledge society. NE should strongly denounce the actions and consequences of this cartel. A Guardian article, of possible relevance to the group
http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/23/internet-freedom-market-forces thanks to Nancy Roberts for finding this one These children will make the future too. this is a very interesting piece of work relevant to those of us here I believe:
"First, social-psychological studies of small groups show that "moral exemplars" -- those who stand outside the general consensus and at first are labeled as "extremists" -- can often be very effective, but with one important qualification: they can't be too extreme or else they will be ignored. Thus, the trick for any social change agent is to be just extreme enough to be an "effective extremist." What do folks on the Next Edge think of behavioral economics? May sound absurd, but for some reason i expect to have the sophistication these guys have to emergence of artificial general intelligence.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=x18yaOXBSQA

That is, social emergence isn't just something we stop at the edge of, but it is something we can play with quite accurately... Indeed, if we want to get a global sustainable situation, i think we will need this level of complex system composition.

If they are at level 7 out of 10 in terms of understanding and playing with emergence in AGI, where are we with understanding and playing with emergence in social systems? Our friend Arno Hesse is spotlighted in this SF Gate article today about Slow Money, Slow Food.  http://bit.ly/puaTFB I think its interesting where we ground ourselves. If we want to motivate ourselves for social responsibility, a deep familiarity with everything problematic in the world needs to be ritually nourished. But to achieve happiness, we also need as human beings psychologically to "just let go", say the serenity prayer ("God grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference. ") or its equivalent, and move on with the social responsibility we can accept, that which we feel we can make a difference with regards to. But among the gathered people here are systems thinkers who have a psychological challenge in that we think we can make a huge difference. So if we ritually nourish ourselves with understanding of what is broken as we feel more capable of changing the world we feel exponentially more responsible given the degree to which we think we can change the world has increased with our own and our community's cumulative insight. I felt better when I pressed on: http://make-everything-ok.com/. I think that we need the parameters for our personal agency in a world in which there are abundant things we can change that ought to be changed, but not all of which can be any one of our responsibility at any moment. I think the way forward it strategic rather than tactical "maximin" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)- for those things we seek in the world that we optimize the contexts in which we can have a major impact as change makers globally, and we seek to make those changes locally we feel as human beings we must because they affect our communities and who we can be in them, and for those things that humanize us by providing justice to them, we artistically seek to maximize those minimums too. I'm sharing because I think a bit of cartography of overlapping aspirations could prompt radically delightful implications. And I think its easier to feel OK about the areas we're not working in but do care about to the degree to which we know and trust someone to being on a path to really make a change in that dimension of the world. I'd love to get to the point where everything is ok in the sense that the aspects of the world that most need to be sorted each have someone i know personally and trust on a path to sorting each dimension of the world that I care about. If all these transformations were simultaneously in process, then I would feel the meta-prosperity. things are warming up! and just when i was making for the exit! ho hum

Do you think we even have time to 'plant our garden' as change agents..

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/arts/design/fluxus-and-the-essential-questions-of-life-review.html This talk by Jaron Lanier has literally forever transformed my thinking on the interplay of economics and the increasing power of the net. It's one of those before and after pieces of content with so many implications for everything that is discussed here every day that I am confident that it will be of interest to everyone here. A balance of a really original take, backed up by personal experience and insight, with an inspirational alternative to the current concept of the internet, and many throwaway asides that could be explored more fully in and of themselves. I cannot recommend it more highly.

Just met artist Carson Case at TEDxGotham yesterday and she's really cool (and her art is amazing). She's in a bit of a tight spot since her storage unit in Miami didn't renew her lease and unless she can raise $11K for moving costs to drive all her art from FL to NYC (or Indiana, where she's from), she's going to lose her art. 
What you can do:
--Retweet/repost this.
--Ask your friends in Miami who might have extra storage space if they could help move and/or store her art for her while she raises funds to move it to a more permanent location.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tl7gD_TqKg Bobby Fishkin and I have been chatting, and have discovered that there are only 24 hours in the day. We have therefore come to a fresh hypothesis as how to meet two objectives. 

The first objective is that an abundance of humanizing dialogue with diverse fascinating social entrepreurs, visionaries, futurists, revolutionaries, empathetic humanizers, intrapreneurs, and all around wonderful people is important.

The second objective is that fresh air and exercise combined with these conversations are  exquisite resources we need in abundance.

So we figured that it would an excellent idea, for those of use in the Bay Area, to inaugurate a new tradition of going for hikes regularly. The first will be this Friday, 9/23, at 4:30pm, meeting in front of The Legion Of Honor. We will then set off towards The Lands End Hike Trail-- http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/environmentnature/qt/landendtrail.htm - it should take somewhere just over an hour!

Our co hosts for this hike are:
Jessica Margolin
Jim Keravala
Lina Constantinovici
Stamos Venios
Todd Siegel
Matt Dryhurst

RSVPs are optional but are encouraged so that we know to look out for you. We look forward to walking and talking with you!

We shared earlier this week that: "Bobby Fishkin and David Hodgson have been chatting, and have discovered that there are only 24 hours in the day.

So we figured that it would an excellent idea, for those of use in the Bay Area, to inaugurate a new tradition of going for hikes regularly."
We now have further news in that the first four hikes have been scheduled-- 

Friday September 23rd, 4:30pm: @ the Legion of Honor at
Friday September 30th, 5pm: @ the Legion of Honor
Friday October 14th, 4:30pm: @ the The Presidio Officers’ Club and Visitor Center, located at 50 Moraga Avenue on the Main Post of the Presidio, we will then head to the trail together.
Sunday October 23rd, 2pm: @ La Coppa Coffee, 2 Miller Ave Mill Valley, CA 94941, we will then head to the trail together thereafter on Mt. Tam

RSVPs for hiking are optional but are encouraged so that we know to look out for you.

The hikes will have a number of co-hosts- perhaps 6-20 co-hosts per hike. Each co-host agrees to show up and bring one interesting guest who they think might be mutually appreciated by the other gathered folks, and to be named in emails going out about the hike. All visionaries & revolutionaries on this list are invited to be co-hosts for a hike if you would like. Please add your name as a co-host below the date of the hike listed here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmQfhAjsxaIGdFZvTVZDUVJzbGtvZUQwSlYyVXFfMUE&hl=en_US) if you would like to co-host which I would encourage you to do if you are interested.

 http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n17/john-lanchester/the-non-scenic-route-to-the-place-were-going-anyway (branching from Mimi's thread...) Giorgio Bertini, I'm all for the spirit of education that you describe. Before the advent of public schools on the factory model, the Lancaster System (inspired by peer-learning in India) helped millions to learn through private enterprise.  The story of its rise and demise is well told in this NY Times article: http://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/130.html .  I think we may now be able to bring back its best aspects through entrepreneurial approaches such as http://is.gd/altfunding. 

Part of preparing kids to thriving in a P2P, free agent economy is to encourage them to grow as "whole persons" and to build fluency with teamwork and venture-building at an early age. This is happening through initiatives such as MicroSociety Schools (http://is.gd/microsocietyschools ).  Another escape path from top-down, we-know-best systems of learning could be to introduce competition to improve failing public schools, including through learning ventures owned by students (http://is.gd/studentsown ).

Also, private ventures are at the forefront of enriching a global commons of learning materials. MIT's OpenCourseware Initiative, Google's Youtube Edu offerings, and the Khan Academy's free courses are examples of this. The global reach of such resources will be vastly greater as microscholarship/microvoucher systems spread (to cover internet access costs) and are incorporated into the curricula of local schools.

Bureaucratic organizations funded by taxes have few incentives to see such disruptive alternatives (eg peer learning, Brainbench.com-style skills certification, microscholarships, Skype-based tutoring from diasporas, and free courseware) spread.  I think people who are free to choose will increasingly opt out of failing factory-model schools to engage with more user-sensitive partners for lifelong learning. cc Dinesh Tantri Gregory Rader Tiberius Brastaviceanu Kate Michi Ettinger When your life's work is to serve all of humanity - helping to usher in a new guiding story - it's hard to know where to send the invoice.

~Rumi Next Edge Role Model: Tzeporah Berman, the Radical Pragmatist

Tzeporah Berman is radical pragmatist. She has spent the last 20 years fighting for the forests, the future and the planet. And she has made a big difference. She founded ForestEthics and has worked to stop the destruction of old-growth forests.

Tzeporah is radical. She's risked arrest on logging blockades. She's pragmatic. She negotiates with her opponents (big business CEOs) on their turf. And she gets things done. She helped save Canada's Great Bear Rainforest from clear-cutting. 

Tzeporah says that the key ingredients to making change happen is "common sense and courage." People who are engaged can change the world, and we need to change more than light bulbs, we need to change our system -- e.g. our laws. Good post on what the leverage points are in changing systems. Serendipity is not only the magical occurrence - it is the awareness that it is significant and noteworthy. Reading Wikileaks & Age of Transparency, I realized that I was witness to many of the historic moments he wrote about... I just didn't notice that they were significant. What way of seeing the world enables people to notice that significance? I would think this is important in future-casting. Thoughts? Mapping transformation Spectrums

"October 28-30, 2011

The old economy is failing.  A new economy is sprouting like shoots after a forest fire. This transition to new ways of understanding and organizing work is as significant as the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture 11,000 years ago and from agriculture to industry a few hundred years ago.

From Detroit, Michigan, where industrial jobs are gone forever, to points across the globe, there are exciting and moving stories of invention and reinvention.

In October 2011 in Detroit, a groundbreaking conference will gather thinkers and doers from the worlds of activism, community organizing, labor, crafts, media, entrepreneurship, the arts, academe, and ‘green’—in a 3-day collaborative discussion. You will come away inspired by people with whom you can collaborate in this profound economic and spiritual transformation." Isofractal - Social Software for Doing and Helping

A VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE Tuesday 1 PM EDT, 10 AM PDT

As many have no doubt noticed from our prior comments, several of us; Suresh Fernando, my friend Kenny, and I; are actively working on a startup company to build a new kind of social software.

Isofractal is part social discussion system like Facebook, part I.T. infrastructure for the open free-agent economy, and part map and navigator of the deeper social networks that really tie us together as human beings, Isofractal will be an open-source project and associated running infrastructure that will make it easier for everyone to figure out how best to fit into the wider global network of people who are working to make the world better. Isofractal's goal will be to help us strengthen our connections, connections between people and connections between groups of people.

The questions will be part of an art-object i will share with NE. NEdgers can share answers in this art-object. The answers will be shared to leaders and decision makers of the cosmetics industry in october 2011. 

Here are some questions to begin with:

"A human system attractor is a concept that is fuzzy, but defined enough to be understood sufficiently for people to go, hmm, that is a good idea - i'll head in that direction. It is a lighthouse. The trick is to make them evolutionary - so that they self modify based upon feedback - as people interact with them, they absorb the needs of those who are attracted to them, so it becomes a process of co-definition and co-creation."

What lighthouse are you steering by? In case you need any evidence of the ongoing "dumbing down" of America, today's column by widely read Conservative columnist David Brooks claims that the entire concept of "planning to improve the system" is, basically, a waste of time.  I urge you all to post comments on Twitter, etc to knock down Brooks' possibly unintended (or perhaps conscious) attempt to undermine the very idea of planning. STRATEGIC PROPOSAL: Invite funders (angels, social finance funders, foundations etc) to this conversation. 

The reason that I think that this is important is that in the traditional model, funders and projects stand in opposition each other. The process for raising funds requires, projects to define plans, draft proposal, build teams, develop models, find markets etc... IN ADVANCE of engaging with funding sources.

In my view, New Paradigm (Next Edge) models, need to be maximally co-creative. One of those important areas where co-creation needs to take place is in the relationship between funders and projects. We have now have the architecture to start the conversation about the new world, those with resources must be a part of the conversation. All stakeholder need to help to shape the new models that emerge.

One way to think about getting funders to be more comfortable with early stage investment risk is to make sure that they have a stake in shaping how early stage ventures unfold...

http://blog.opensourceecology.org/2011/09/recovery-plan/ The whole conversation about the power of questions and the idea that our life is answer to one has been a huge part of my Existential journey.

What question will your life answer?

(this is an excerpt from one of my favorite books Gregg Levoy's Callings).

Calls are essentially questions. They aren't questions you necessarily need to answer outright; they are questions to which you need to respond, expose yourself and kneel before. You don't want an answer you can put in a box or set on a shelf. You want a question that will become a chariot to carry you across the breadth of your life, a question that will offer you a lifetime of pondering, that will lead you to toward what you need to know for your integrity, draw to you what you need for your journey, and help you to understand what it means to burst at the seams. These questions will also lead you to others whose lives are propelled by the same questions, and from them you will receive "oh never an answer," as P.L. Travers says, "but a spark of instructive fire."

Because this can get a bit esoteric here is some humor to keep us and our curiosity in perspective.

My best to your quest . . .
Jennifer This sounds like a large scale Next Edge inspired project. I believe that some people within this group could assist in this endeavor. on motivation (rework of Dan Pinks classic) Nilofer Merchant: "We often invite people to have a seat at the table as if somehow we’re doing them a favor. But that’s not it. Inviting people to sit at the table holds in it an inherent demand, which is to say, participate, cause we need you." Next Edgers live on the fringes of the possible. Where uncertainty reigns. 

What does it mean to be resilient to risk and uncertainty? What do we do when we don't know what the future will bring? How do we manage in these times of great risk and uncertainty? How do we make decisions? What if we are wrong?

Lessons from the life of an E.R. doctor on managing risk. Power, hierarchy, decentralized systems, openness - what are your thoughts? 

http://discoverynetwork-tibi.blogspot.com/2011/09/hierarchy-vs-decentralization.html Why not enjoy the whole and seek not to break it down into parts? By plucking her petals, you do not gather the beauty of the flower! Tagore "People who work on social software are closer in spirit to economists and political scientists than they are to people making compilers. They both look like programming, but when you're dealing with groups of people as one of your run-time phenomena, that is an incredibly different practice. In the political realm, we would call these kinds of crises a constitutional crisis. It's what happens when the tension between the individual and the group, and the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups, gets so serious that something has to be done.

"And the worst crisis is the first crisis, because it's not just "We need to have some rules." It's also "We need to have some rules for making some rules." And this is what we see over and over again in large and long-lived social software systems. Constitutions are a necessary component of large, long-lived, heterogenous groups.

"Geoff Cohen has a great observation about this. He said "The likelihood that any unmoderated group will eventually get into a flame-war about whether or not to have a moderator approaches one as time increases." As a group commits to its existence as a group, and begins to think that the group is good or important, the chance that they will begin to call for additional structure, in order to defend themselves from themselves, gets very, very high."

Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul! John Muir I love when a natural alternative to something non-biodegradable (in this case foamed polystyrene) comes along... new idea: determining who has their finger on the pulse

Seems to me, that we all do. Everyone who is attracted to this group, been invited. We all know what's going on, more or less, and we all have solutions, and my guess is, most of them are complementary.

I have two contending notions in my head. That teams of people will  perform the greatest breakthroughs of the 21st century, as compared to "individual" geniuses like Newton or Einstein. And that certain individuals integrate as much of what's going on as to have a reasonably coherent diagnosis of what is going on and what is needed; as close to wise as we can get.

And this is the thought: I believe an algorithm can be derived that takes as input the "like" function of FB, that could determine who has the most accurate finger on the pulse. I like various comments, and my value of "like" is determined by those who like comments. It is like the linkability of pages and the algorithm of pagerank by google.

What do you think? Could it really be as simple as this? Of course, some people may start to play politically, strategically, say things to be "liked" rather than say things they think are important or true. Or rivals would not acknowledge each other's contributions. Would we be able to spot them? I am presuming, that if we are wise enough, we would. We'd spot genuine quality. And a like-map would also show incongruities: everyone likes A, everyone likes B, but only A likes B and B does not like A. So, the system would bias towards A.

Is anyone here actually playing around with this kind of algorithm already? I'm not sure if this counts as on / off topic, but I've just done the teaser launch for my new company at www.notasupermarket.co.uk and would be delighted if you could spread the word a little. It combines smart data systems with local food systems, hopefully leveraging network effects to nurture and support viable local production, processing, and distribution.

Rescuing Family Housing in the UK
In recent weeks, I found myself surprised by a repeated position in the readers’ comments of the UK newspaper The Guardian. The position is roughly this: “Women joining the labor force added to household income. They are therefore the enablers of very high rents and very high purchase prices for residential housing. If fewer women went to work,  thus not adding to average household income, this high cost of housing problem would not exist.”

Provocative and visionary statements– so I take time to comprehend:  In other words, the above position states, that the average household (in which a man/woman couple lives) has too much income. Therefore, the household income must be reduced to exact a downward pressure on housing prices.  Now, given that in most of the households which comprise a man/woman couple, the male makes the most  money , especially when they have children,  the answer is clear: The male can exert the biggest influence on this problem.  Hence, on Monday, right away, he will speak with his employer, asking – no, fervently demanding, that he have his working hours be reduced by no less than 30% and his salary cut by at least a corresponding percentage.
Fuelled by this break-through, strengthened by taking action towards addressing a troubling issue of national scale, he walks proud. In full confidence that the household income will soon be insufficient to cover the current housing expenses, he will go out and research a more modest dwelling, maybe in an area which is overall lower-priced. The extra available time will be well-used for this lofty goal.

As he embarks on this housing search, the situation transpires to be more dire than what  even he had anticipated.  Understanding the need for change ever more fully, he also starts a grassroots campaign “Men ‘s  Active Campaign for Housing” (MACHo).  The extra time he has on his hands since the recent complete termination from his employment is proving to be very valuable to the cause, indeed.

Meanwhile, his wife is admirably supportive in light of their new residence (which they finally found): “Dear, I really don’t mind commuting 3 hours to work every day, not one hour, as before. We need to see the bigger picture.  Yes, naturally,  I am a little concerned about the new school for our children – it seems that the percentage of students being accepted in university from there is under 10%. But it will all work out. I might just add some work hours to my day, to make the long commute worthwhile – but not so much that it will raise our household income significantly.”

That night, he dreams about the perfected future:  He can see it clearly. Men will have stopped being wage-slaves almost completely, pursuing the lofty goals of rescuing the nation instead. It will only be the women, driven by their century-long need to catch up in their development, who will continue to engage in family-feeding commerce. In this new society, which understands the reactionary nature of women’s economic activity and therefore does not overly reward it, household income is indeed so low that house prices have fallen for years.

It is brilliant, this vision, it is. If you want to put some next edge thinking to work in the world, join us in the revitalization effort of Central Market Street - http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Central-Market-Partnership-4084015. See upcoming social gamification days in September and October. How about we, the next edge, improve FB?

I like the next edge, because I have felt that I have been beyond the edge for too long. I also am fond of reflection, self-self-discipline, and this translates as improve the system you are in. I suspect a lot of NErs do this, not only with themselves personally but all the way up through organisations to the entire global system. So, why don't we put together a means which will improve FB? Instead of inventing this or that, or turning to other places, which seems to be filling our attention lately? If we can pull together a few suggestions, and then offer them to FB, zuckerberg, gratis, we fulfil a lot of our potential, both as members of this rather edgy group and the ecology in which we find ourselves, on FB.

For example, I have been posting a lot of videos from a new app I had found on my ipad. Problem is, all videos just appear on my stream, with equal weighting. I had just posted a powerful video about some dudes who save a whale and I thought, why doesn't fb put in a self-rating system for posts? I'd have marked this as 8 or 9 out of ten, whereas most of my posts are somewhere around 5 to 7. They could then do calculations, kind of like googlepage ranks, to see how valuable people's self-assessed links are found to be; eg, a person who always puts 10 for everything would eventually end up with a lower rank than a person who usually puts 5's say, and then uniquely puts a 10 -- their 10 would stand out. Hence, a more nuanced sense of subjective quality might appear.

This might be useful for our group discussions, when we write a post or a comment, and tag it with a score from 1 to 10. I am not sure about evaluating others, though I have felt sometimes I'd like to hit like a couple of times when someone has said something I'd like to applaud and not just like.; but there are problems about evaluation other's work. I just thought this might be useful for self-discipline.

What do you think? Apologies in advance for my fixation on collaboration ;-)... another question... What does it take to be a good collaborator? Wonderful to be here with so many of my favorite friends :-) "The idea that every nation, or even every continent, should have just one currency to serve everybody’s needs is a piece of eighteenth century Whig ideology that we have been stuck with unthinkingly ever since.

What do you think? Does this resonate with you?

History of the naming:

Recently there has been some discussions about the global movement that is emerging and whether or not it should be named. See:

http://www.opendemocracy.net/keith-kahn-harris/naming-movement
http://steelweaver.tumblr.com/post/9421190015/whatever-happened-to-interdependence-day-part-1 (see comments)

I've been of the firm opinion that a name is important. Not so much for us here in the Next edge but for the future and past-focused people who have a human need to belong to something bigger. And because if we don't name it, we can be sure that Frank Luntz or someone like him will. Then we'll be stuck with a name that an enemy of the movement has created.

In working through the issues several of from the Next Edge tossed out some names on Twitter and one seemed to resonate best: Generation Now

Thomas Beckett led the discussion onto a temporal focus (John Furey thought you might find this interesting):

"Everyone is wondering what will be next. Let's just be that: 'Next'. Next Edge is already working on it."

and

"We are Next. People are Next. The common needs, our planet's needs, are Next. #next No more waiting."

This solicited an almost immediate response by Bruce Waltuck, Sandy Maxey, and me:

Me: "'Next' just says to me: future never present. The next this or that. What brings future to present?"

and

"Next tells me we're still in line waiting for service from others."

Bruce: "We need not be 'next.' We can be, NOW."

Sandy: "'The No Patience For Mindless Incrementalism BS' generation. TRANSFORMATION NOW"

Me: "We are Now. People are Now. The common needs, our planet's needs, are Now. The present not the future."

After noticing that Bruce and Sandy both focused on Now not Next, I wrote:

"We went the same place: present. People will rally behind NOW. Sense of urgency."

and

"This is important. So many are losing patience with rates of non-progress. How about Generation Now?"

"In both senses of word generation. Verb and a noun. Doing and being. Bringing the future to the present." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Viflr8uas4A Hey all, we just kicked off a 20 post series about policies for a shareable city that will cover urban farming, carsharing, entrepreneurship, governance, and more.

I would like your help.  I am working on a section of a report with John Elkington of Volans in London.  The report is about our individual and organizational Future Quotient, our capacity to change the way we think and behave given the challenges ahead of us.  John would like to use a map of our Next Edge group to show how MindTime technology reveals an individual's or group's time perspective and thinking culture. This is fascinating stuff with very significant implications.

We have 60 Next Edge members now mapped in the MindTime map (see below).  Can you all participate by taking 3 minutes of your time and completing our GPS for the Mind? (link below)

Please encourage your friends and colleagues in Next Edge to participate.  I need our map for John Elkington by Wednesday 14th.  It is very significance that our group, given its name and its agenda is strongly Future thinking. Please will you help us? A bit of a jazz riff on what David Pinto wrote about this morning (his mindflow) and on what Suresh Fernando started yesterday:

I like helping people. I will help anyone in this group who thinks I can be of assistance and who asks me for specific help. No quid quo pro, just ask me. 

FB Message or email at curtis (followed by at) worldhouse (followed by.org). If I can't help directly, I'll try and help you find someone who can.

If you think several in the group might be able to help, just ask the group for help, and refer to me by name here in a cc: so I can know you want me to look at the specific question or issue. I had a mindflow early this morning, some deep currents of which relate directly to what is happening here on the Next Edge. I don't think my comments and posts have elicited enough interest to warent a dive into it, but I would be interested in your response. Chilly? Warm?

http://2020worldwalk.blogspot.com/2011/09/another-mindflow-and-another-end-in.html Further to David Pinto`s suggestion, I am going to offer 4 hours  a week of volunteer time to some NE project. The only condition is that you need to convince me that your project is aligned with my longer term objectives... Does anyone know of any surveys that look at "Trust in Government" in the US?

Matthew Abrams, nice to see you here.  Thanks for the question.  The fulcrum of my focus tends to be on the interior perspective (left in AQAL).  This relates to: culture, evolutionary/transpersonal psych, values, compassionate communication (NVC), & metrics on the subjective.  

I work at Barrett Values Centre.  We believe in realizing human potential.  We do this through measuring values in cultures.  We've done this with over 1,000 organizations in 60+ countries.   We've been measuring the values of nations in the last several years, with varying degrees of national government involvement....most recently South Africa.

I like to skim through the other edge happenings.  I love what Jordan Greenhall has proposed.  It would help me to get the most out of this group.  I could focus on particular areas of interest when my schedule is tight...and wander when my mind wants to stretch. Interesting visual map which clusters related topics together. TNE-style stuff is close to the center of the graph. 

Background: http://lanyrd.com/blog/2011/visualising/

Does that give anyone ideas? Proposed: build a new "social network" both around and for The Next Edge.  This should include the right infrastructure for solving the problems that we have here (tracking what is happening, finding the most useful and interesting conversations, participating where most useful, etc.) and leveraging what we have here to optimize our ability to contribute (e.g., using virtual and social currencies, launch projects, etc.). I like what's happening here with the upsurge of action and support for one another in this community. In order to foster this potential, I'm going to begin gathering and organizing info from members to clarify where folks could use help and offer it. Post 3 (at most) areas where you can be of service to other members and 3 (at most) areas where you would like support from community Edglings.

You do not need to post in both categories.  This info may become something larger, but we'll start here and see what comes of it. I have been following a project for a while that focuses on architecting a discourse on the future of humanity: the Human Project. A conversation I am looking forward to have and to weigh into.

"Economists always ask us to ‘imagine’ how things must have worked before the advent of money. What such examples bring home more than anything else is just how limited their imaginations really are. When one is dealing with a world unfamiliar with money and markets, even on those rare occasions when strangers did meet explicitly in order to exchange goods, they are rarely thinking exclusively about the value of the goods. This not only demonstrates that the Homo Oeconomicus which lies at the basis of all the theorems and equations that purports to render economics a science, is not only an almost impossibly boring person—basically, a monomaniacal sociopath who can wander through an orgy thinking only about marginal rates of return—but that what economists are basically doing in telling the myth of barter, is taking a kind of behavior that is only really possible after the invention of money and markets and then projecting it backwards as the purported reason for the invention of money and markets themselves. Logically, this makes about as much sense as saying that the game of chess was invented to allow people to fulfill a pre-existing desire to checkmate their opponent’s king. 

* * *
At this point, it’s easier to understand why economists feel so defensive about challenges to the Myth of Barter, and why they keep telling the same old story even though most of them know it isn’t true. If what they are really describing is not how we ‘naturally’ behave but rather how we are taught to behave by the market—well who, nowadays, is doing most of the actual teaching? Primarily, economists. The question of barter cuts to the heart of not only what an economy is—most economists still insist that an economy is essentially a vast barter system, with money a mere tool (a position all the more peculiar now that the majority of economic transactions in the world have come to consist of playing around with money in one form or another) [10]—but also, the very status of economics: is it a science that describes of how humans actually behave, or prescriptive, a way of informing them how they should? (Remember, sciences generate hypothesis about the world that can be tested against the evidence and changed or abandoned if they don’t prove to predict what’s empirically there.)

Or is economics instead a technique of operating within a world that economists themselves have largely created? Or is it, as it appears for so many of the Austrians, a kind of faith, a revealed Truth embodied in the words of great prophets (such as Von Mises) who must, by definition be correct, and whose theories must be defended whatever empirical reality throws at them—even to the extent of generating imaginary unknown periods of history where something like what was originally described ‘must have’ taken place?"

http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/david-graeber-on-the-invention-of-money-%E2%80%93-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics.html a question that arose for me whilst i was reflecting yesterday on the events of the last ten years (and which Kevin Warnock expressed most eloquently): does vengeance lead to healing (when viewed from the perspective of the collective human experience)? How important is it for NE members to agree on something?... anything! David Hodgson quoted Martin Luther Kink Jr. in a comment about vengeance:

"Perhaps we need MLK's ideas to catch on fire first 'I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a "thing-oriented" society to a "person-oriented" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.'"

What do you think? How do ideas catch on fire? Can one do anything to help spread them?

Is this even a good idea? 

Or should we just let ideas spread naturally? If so, what distinguishes "spreading naturally" from its alternatives? 9/11/2001: I was 22 and just had dropped out of grad school because I desperately wanted to travel the world, and because I felt like my own world was going to explode. My exact words. I left NYC and the country in July, thinking I'd never come back and that there was nothing more to life than living out my dream to travel the world. By September, I was way off the beaten path, on the Indo-Tibetan border on a raw trek through the Northern most part of the Himalaya. Two weeks in silence trekking through my own private shambala, and I found my raison d'etre. I arrived in Ladakh, and began machinating on how I"d actualize my next step. Somehow, I knew there was no more 'real world' to go back to. Riding on the very last bus of the season that took tourists down from the mountains, I reveled in my impenetrable freedom. A few hours into the two-day bus ride, we hit a traffic jam on a mountain peak and were evacuated from the bus. Just as I was gazing out at the most expansive mountain range my eyes had ever witnessed, a multi-kulti motley crew of passengers approached me and informed me of the attack on America. Deep in the Parvati Valley, the headlines were that all of lower Manhattan had been obliterated, that upwards of 500K people were killed, that Israel was involved, and that America was on its knees. For the rest of that day's bus ride, I sat in my seat and ate mealy bananas and said Kaddish as rode 30 km per hour around hair pin turns and several mountain passes. Miles and days away from phones or internet or a newspaper, I mourned for my own presumed personal loss. That night, we camped out on a river and over a dozen of us, from every religion, age group, nation, sexual orientation, all gathered as ONE in a yurt and huddled around a shortwave radio as we listened to each world leader offer their statement.

I will never forget the words of the Lebanese diplomat: 'The American cowboy has reaped what he has sown for the crime he has committed against all of humanity."

Together, our group of strangers listened and weeped, while we all embraced and envisioned a brave new world, of which this horrifying tragedy was the spark.

A decade later, and I am as rooted in New York City as the grand boulders in Central Park. I am now proud to be Jewish, proud to be American, beyond grateful to be a New Yorker, and am living out the very dream that was seeded on that trek exactly one decade ago. My dear country, my beautiful city, and this nation's unbelievable populace: we have reaped what we have sown, we have paid dearly, and the time has come for the pendulum to swing and for us to weave the brave new world that all humans on this planet deserve...as ONE... This daily roundup of worldchanging trends is one of my favorite sources of news, published by my good friend Stephan A. Schwartz. Enjoy! Not sure what to make of this...

Someone pinch me." Hello Folks, 
Which socially relevant thought, pertaining to USA, according to you is facing communication challenges in terms of its adoptability. To elaborate on what I am trying to say with an example - Do you think 'local produce' or the social movement around it requires a communication strategy to make it more successful? 
So what according to you is that one thing for which 10 most wonderful people of the world should sit and design a communication strategy? Over the past four weeks, a number of Next Edgers have come up with ideas on how we might create snapshots of proposed challenges and initiatives. 

I've just put up a chart with 10 alternative formats for profiling projects in a side-by-side comparison:  http://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/what-is-the-best-standard-format-for-next-edge-challenge-opportunity-pro-vvhx49r# . There's a voting button below each format for Next Edgers to indicate their preferences.

New formats can be added by clicking on the "+" button on top left corner of the table (after you've logged in). I hope originators of the existing formats will also jump in to polish the text of the profiles, which reflect cut-and-paste transfers from earlier Next Edge posts.

As and when Next Edge subgroups settle on their preferred profile formats, and fill out proposed initiatives, the overall community may be better able - as Kevin Jones has put it - to find promising parts of the Next Edge "Giving Tree"...

Where do you think we are, in the broader sweep of history? 

Together, let's discuss:

Where is the financial economy headed over the next decade? Why?
How do you describe the non-financial economy? What's its role?
What's the relationship between these two economies?

The future is not some place we are going to but one we are creating. The paths are not to be found, but made, and the activity of making them changes both the maker and the destination."

On Children
 Kahlil Gibran

Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, 
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, 
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, 
but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth.

One of the hardest things for me as a parent it to balance my own needs to carve out my own edges and my need to create stability for my children. It is very hard to be authentic and responsible. It is a razor thin line and one I pray for wisdom each day. Our innovation is often expensive for members of our family. Jennifer Im thinking a lot about challenges working w the networks of hubs. Nat geo, etc Has anyone gone to one of these courses?  Are they worth the time/money?  Would appreciate your advice. http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses I do not wish to start the most unproductive debate of recent times on this forum but this might be of interest to some. http://opinion.financialpost.com/2011/08/26/lawrence-solomon-science-now-settled/ Fascinating perspective from Jane McGonigal on how qualities developed through virtual game play (i.e., urgent optimism, social fabric, blissful productivity and epic meaning) might help solve many of the globe's most epic challenges.

Can we really leverage the "masters" of virtual gaming to solve real-world problems? I know of one such effort in the food space (see Kyra Kristof Pincheira's pollin8r vision). Are there others? Singularity University's School for Startups:  http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/singularity-university-peter-diamandis-2247/ So after 4 days at SOCAP Kevin Jones and David Hodgson say 'TNE is working'. Can you gentlemen expand on that thought? I suspect there are loads of interesting observations underneath that statement. You folks are certainly hitting all my buttons today. This is what I wish President George W. Bush said soon after the 9/11/01 events:

“The United States is profoundly sorry and embarrassed.

Without an invitation, the United States has been acting like the policeman of the world.

We recognize that  there are other valid points of view on how to live life. We don’t want to be attacked like this again, so I ask those of you who wish us harm to please share with us how we can avoid such attacks. We are willing to make big changes, and we’re willing to spend a lot of money to be a nicer world citizen. To demonstrate our resolve to change and see the point of view of others, the United States today is contributing USD $100,000,000,000 to get the ball rolling towards a more fair and sane planet. We will spend to improve the lot of the people that attacked us.

On behalf of the United States of America, I am sorry that this country has acted such that you believe you had to attack it. While this country may not agree with your points of view, it does recognize that you view your points of view as valid and worth advancing. Clearly, we need to talk, and we will talk. I personally will talk face to face with your representatives.

The United States feels so strongly that it will learn to play nice on the world stage that beyond the USD $100 billion I just spoke of, I am committed to working with the US House and Senate to gain approval to spend up to USD $3,000,000,000,000 over the next decade to fix what’s wrong with the world.

The United States is not a vindictive nation.

The United States could respond by starting wars and destroying entire countries, but we’re bigger than that, and we will show our attackers that the people of the United States are your friends, not your enemies. War is terrible. Peace is golden. The United States stands for peace, not war.

On behalf of everyone in the United States, including the families of those who lost loved ones today, I appologize for our actions, attitudes and positions that led others to believe that they had to attack the United States so violently to get our attention.

With hard work and determination, today will be the last time that any people of the world should feel that they have to attack us to get us to change our overstepping ways.

The United States in fact is ashamed that it has come to this, that we have upset other people so dramatically and profoundly that they have responded by flying airplanes into our landmarks, ending the lives of so many earnest people in the process.

Let us spend the following ten minutes in silence to reflect on the enormity of the events of today. Let us imagine a world filled with peace, happiness and enough to eat and drink. Let us cast aside our revengeful impulses so that we can come together at a meeting table to plan how the people of the world shall overcome the horror of today in favor of the brightness of a more promising future for all of humanity.

To the friends and family of those who lost their lives today, if you want to be upset with somebody, be upset with me and the past Presidents of The United States of America. What happened today was a reaction to this country overstepping its place in the world. It simply is not nice to tell other people how to live while we consume such a disproportionate percentage of the resources of the planet. In the decades ahead, we will need to learn to share our bounty with others more than we have done so far. Look on this redistribution of wealth as your insurance payment for the future safety of you, your property and your loved ones, not as a handout. The United States has been acting like a rich, spoiled kid on the playground eating the finest candy and laughing while others nearby starve and have little. We can remain a wealthy and prosperous and happy nation while at the same time leveling the playing field. We are a nation of thoughtful and ingenious innovators, and if we put forth our full effort, perhaps 100 times greater than what was required to place a man on the moon, we can solve the really big problems the world today faces.

Three trillion dollars is a lot of money. We can spend that amount building peace, love and goodwill. We can also spend three trillion dollars killing hundreds of thousands of people and destroying countries.

I am certain that three trillion dollars of peace, love and goodwill is more valuable than three trillion dollars of rubble, hate and death.

May September 11, 2001 be viewed by history as the first day of the most kind and peaceful period the world has yet known.

For those of you that worship a higher power, may that higher power give you comfort on this historic day of new beginnings. Let us rejoice in the saved lives of the hundreds of thousands of people this nation will not kill in response to the events of today. Let us rejoice in the new lives of the hundreds of thousands of babies by coincidence born this historic day. It is tragic that the United States lost thousands of its residents today, but keep in mind more babies were born in the United States today than lives were lost in these four plane crashes.

The United States is your friend, not your enemy. The United States wants peace, prosperity and fairness for all the people of the world.

Tomorrow will be better.

I love you.”

This is an excerpt from my blog post: http://kevinwarnock.com/2011/09/11/what-president-george-w-bush-should-have-said-soon-after-the-september-11-2001-events/

Hello to this group. I haven't contributed until today, even though I've been a member for some weeks now. I am honored to have been added to the group, and I hope I'm not violating some code of conduct with this piece. This is the first time I've written something online so intense.

My next post here will be quite a bit less intense... Great new documentary coming soon...

(See http://www.survivingprogress.com ) Excellent post on the adapability of networks compared with hiearchies by @MaxMckeown: Hiearchy is Fossil Fuel  http://bit.ly/p1zyH6 In recognition of those who perished on 9/11 and through all other acts of violence and warfare, and in the interests of linking this community to the global peace movements,  I would like to recommend the work of my friend and colleague Marc Pilisuk and his co--workers Mike Nagler and Jennifer Achord Rountree.  Marc has been a tireless worker in peace field for many years and so has Mike Nagler. The new books are: 
Who Benefits From Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System by Marc Pilisuk  with Jennifer Achord Rountree.  Westport, CT: Greenwood/Praeger 2008
Peace Movements World-wide (3 volumes) Marc Pilisuk and Michael Nagler (Eds) Praeger/ABC-clio. Santa Barbara, CA: to be published this month. 2011 This is the kinda political stuff I'm willing to put time into supporting: Principles, not rules... Feels like everyone in here lives by a lot of these already. On this day, while we hold the victims and their families of 9/11 attack in our thoughts and prayers, let us remember that there are many parts of the world where political violence is a daily occurrence and where thousands of innocent people are terrorized and killed every year. Let us remember that no violence will ever eliminate violence and that violence will never disappear until it disappears from our individual and collective consciousness. There's a great webinar coming up on Sept 29th on Modern Portfolio theory hosted by RSF Social Finance - lead by Don Shaffer and Leslie Christian. This webinar will cover a new fact-based framework for investment analysis, security selection and asset allocation. It will highlight the current flaws of Modern Portfolio Theory and will propose new foundational elements that challenge investors to expand their understanding of risk, growth and economic utility. 

I attended their session on this at SOCAP and it was great, in particular, the thought-paper that they shared to change the way we approach investment analysis. The link is: http://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/770910873 My partner Graham Leicester and I are working on a project tracking 21st century psychological changes We need some help and think this group could be a likely spot to find it. 

We would like to get your read on the current social world you (and we) are living in and what changes it might be creating in our “model” psychology. .  Reading the posts here I believe I see some common threads that speak of a shift in ways of thinking and understanding the world.  In particular, it looks like the Enlightenment world view that has been stressed through two hundred years of Western acculturation, with its emphasis on identity, self-hood, reason, progress, bounded individualism, heroic agency, scientific method, secularism and optimism, and its distrust of spirituality, intuition, emotion, and mysticism and “superstition”, that is expressed in the “modern psyche” is shifting to something different.  In particular the “post-modern psyche” is more fluid, hybridized, less individualistic  and expresses more “flow” than fixity.  But it is easy for me to notice signals that make sense to me and miss those that don't.  So I need other eyes and voices to stiffen up my view of what is going on at the “next edge”.  
 I would be happy if a conversation went on about this, here. But I would also like to have the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation about it. I would like, for instance, your sense of the cultural significance if you see one of events like Burning Man, Bioneers, SOCAL or others I may not be aware of. These seem like culture making events to me but I would like to hear directly from those of you who are producing them. Are people who go to these events different?  Is there a generation gap? Where’s the hope? Where’s the threat? Etc.   
 I would also like to hear what you think the profile of a 21st century person is shaping up to be.   If you would like to participate in this project I would love to hear from you. We could set up a SKYPE conversation or communicate via email.    My  email address is: maureen@internationalfuturesforum.com. And SKYPE is maureen.ohara72. Just being exposed to the term "effectuation" something beautiful in this paper. Funny how things written about a decade ago seem so current , relevant and real. Powerful retro view.
http://www.effectuation.org/sites/default/files/AMR01.pdf Yes. Zygmunt Bauman’ describes  a "liquid" modernity: a state of constantly changing circumstances and shifting priorities that make it difficult for individuals to have the time or frames of reference to organize their lives under conditions of extreme ambiguity. He refers to this as an "interregnum" The "north arrow" of my life (my personal mission statement) is making global peace and prosperity possible. 

What's your personal mission statement? Just discovered this excellent book...

http://www.amazon.com/Voices-Truth-Conversations-Scientists-Thinkers/dp/0914955829 DK Matai - just saw your latest ATCA Linked In group post about greek default and eurozone crisis. If that is all about to collapse (and i believe it may well be) - then - given the influential folks who are in your network - is there forward looking value to be created by bringing innovation ideas from this group into the discourse within yours? Is social capital what is needed given the failure of financial capital? How do we effectively plant the seeds of the new so the can emerge most effectively from the collapse of the old? I think next edge is working I am going to be offline for a few days. That has never before given me even a hint of anxiety - in 21 years. I just want you all to know - I already miss the discussion here. THANK YOU. Greek default? Never believe anything until it’s been officially denied! Greece has issued three denials this weekend that one can count... As one remembers the tragedy of 9/11 one has to also note that many people have been born today including our friends, confidants and Guide.

Some of them I know well and some are brand new. Plenty to read over the weekend and grist for the mill.  I am especially looking for 1st person experiential narratives. I would like to hear--I mean deeply hear--what is your experience of life at the edge is.  We did some interviews with peple in Brazil in the 1970s as Brazil went from dictatorship to democracy and those interviews changed my sense of the psychological tasks required in a change in world order. one important learning for me was that is was a complex and messy process.  My sense is that we may be going through something similar.  Thanks to those who have already agreed to be interviewed. I'll follow up. So it's not just us.

No. I think he is wise; It is the rest of the world that is foolish."

For those of you interested in collaborative bookmarking, a number of us (19 of us so far) are over on Diigo with a group set up specifically for The Next Edge bookmark sharing. 

It's invite-only to keep it just to the folks here. Just visit the site and ask to join. The leading poster of interesting stuff right now is Daniel Durrant - by a long shot. It's an interesting experiment in collaborative knowledge curation. And if you're like me and already a Del.icio.us bookmark user, there's a super easy way to import your bookmarks from Del.icio.us and even automatically continue posting there via Diigo. Suresh turned me onto it and I find I now like Diigo better. 

Here's the link: http://groups.diigo.com/group/the-next-edge My latest article... inspired by our Next Edge meet-up last week.  This is an intro to phase transitions in social systems.

Or was it like this always? Is there something to hide? What information about another project do you want to know that would help you, in as timely a manner as possible, decide whether it lines up with your project? - whether the two projects might fit together somehow and therefore be worth exploring more deeply. How should projects be REPRESENTED such that you easily understand what is important about them? Am I the only person that is finding it virtually impossible to track what is happening in this group? It's already scaled beyond my capacity to track new posts, let alone activity on old threads... not that there is even a good system to find old threads... To bad we can't tag threads or subscribe to particular discussions... Anyone interested in taking our interaction to a deeper level where we can both dig into the threads we want to AND maintain sufficient visibility into new threads? Back in August Flemming Funch posed a question about trying to create an organizing framework for this group and in one of the comments I mentioned an email list that I'm on that had a good set of guidelines around the culture of the list. I just finally found those guidelines and figured I'd post them here to see if any of it resonated. (I think in practice, it's what's just naturally occurred here with this bunch of grownups...). 

"X" List is a big tent space for:

Creative ideas and projects from all sectors

·      Report backs and lessons learned

·      Success stories –what’s working? (it’s OK to brag :)

·      Questions and brainstorms

·      Requests for advice and collaboration

·      Articles, videos, movies and books related to movement-building

·      Strategize rapid response to pivotal opportunities or crises

·      Diversity of approaches (unity without uniformity)

·      Forming spin-off working groups on particular projects

 

"X" List is NOT a space for:

·      One right answer (I’m right, you’re wrong)

·      Personal attacks, even subtle ones (I’m good, you suck)

·      Dissing progressive organizations, individuals or efforts

·      Drama (take it offline)

·      Fundraising appeals

·      Illegal coordination between party and non-party entities

·      “My friend is moving to Brooklyn and needs a sublet…”

·      Job descriptions, except in the context of major transitions.

·      Sharing other people’s emails unless they specify: “Please share” I was just being reminded of New Games, starting with Bernie DeKoven's article on Coliberation and New Games: http://www.deepfun.com/fun/2011/09/more-thoughts-on-coliberation-part-three-new-games/ I'm going to find my New Games books on the shelf and play more. This kind of game spirit frees up energies to come together and flow. An indigenous perspective on leadership... why a Bill of Rights and not a Bill of Responsibilities... there is much talk in the US about rights... what about responsibilities?... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqfvUA2vRAM&feature=related The Financial Times has launched a special series on the "Future of Banking". I wonder if any of their analysis will show that they understand the problem from a whole systems perspective? Future reading for me...

Wise words from a pioneer in Systems Thinking, particularly the Social Systems Sciences.

Who in this group, see themselves as FireStarters? - as Seb Paquet for clarification as to what this means ;-) Just a quick note to say thanks to everyone who participates here. Am learning a lot. Participation shapes the future. It makes more sense to access geothermal energy through water than rock: simple innit? My new role on Bruce Marshall's advisory board is to help bring the necessary global resources to bear.

Buddha Hi all, I've not been able to participate in this group as much as I would like recently, as the group I'm working with, Post Growth Institute, have been up to our necks organising Free Money Day >> a global stunt planned for next Thurs 15 September. You can find out more here: www.freemoneyday.org As part of the lead-in to this, it would be great to share with any examples this group's members may have about positive examples of alternatives to our current economic and monetary systems (we currently have 604 followers, and - subject to checking our server being able to handle it! - actor Stephen Fry's team are willing to Tweet our announcement to his 3,000,000 followers!). Due to some truly brilliant timing, I'm going to be departing o/s this Saturday, but can forward anything you'd like to share with this page to one of my colleagues.

traditionally, we attribute intellectual movements to specific authors, since they were the first to fix things into books, but as we know, this downplays the contributions of  unprofessional contemporaries... we wouldn't have heard of socrates if plato hadn't written about him... if we are to make moves from pundits and experts, we need to find ways of providing concrete evidence of forward-thinking individuals, even if the trace is as thin as a blog... have we had enough time on the net for this "evidence" to be mined...? if not, by eg 2020, will we have developed enough for us to ascertain who has their finger on their pulse as we read and write here?

i've been out in the wilderness for a year, after burning out attempting and failing to engage adults... although a few inspiration things happened, nothing like what was needed caught on... it is a delight to find so many switched on people here, and again i am indebted to Josef Davies-Coates for inviting me to join the group...

although all i really wanted to say was thank you, i would like to ask whether there is any possibility of us doing something together, other than writing? i developed a game that is best conducted in person, but that may be too much to ask for with this group, so diverse geographically as we are... i would just like to offer something that may get us to the point of manifesting something collectively, even if it is a small group of 5-9 people...

again, i only suggest this out of thankfulness. if collective action is not something that this group is designed for, and is more of a resource for interesting dialogue (which is valuable in itself of course), please forgive my enthusiasm. be well! Hi 
To answer your question ...

After doing quite of bit of personal and group work, I too have a strong desire to see heart added to the work. I have learned that its usually not the head nor the heart that kills an evolving process. Rather, its the gut, if not kept in check, as it's that visceral place that is too often reactive rather than responsive. In collaboration, each are held by the group who watch the emergence and evolution of their deign through these lenses. So when designing I look at 5 sets of 3 things, as per below. Each person in the collaborative design process has to hold these frames in the form of INQUIRIES. i.e. Question is the way of the watcher, which is the source of sustainable design … From these frames below, we must ask ourselves constantly: Which mode is another person speaking from? And what is the group as a whole emphasizing? 

Structure/Pattern/Process: 
3 ways to look at any object or subject that opens the view of what is being considered (example: a wine glass .. The glass is the structure, the way it was made is the process, and the way it rings when you run your wet finger around the rim reflects its pattern)

Principle/Practice/Policy: 
3 ways to consider what is being created. The principle guides the work, the practice is the action that reflects the work, and the policy is the governor that monitors the relationship between principles and practices (see image at https://skitch.com/virtualhelpsquad/fsy36/dscf1841-fuel-for-discovering-sustainable-innovation (brndt this will help us in our conversation later)

Head/Heart/Gut: 
head is the intelligence, heart is the desire, gut is the emotion … THIS PIECE IS CRITICAL TO EVOLVING RATHER THAN COLLAPSING COLLABORATIVE DESIGN
Reduce/Reuse/Recycle: For the design of ecosystems: metabolic closed loops are important to consider https://skitch.com/virtualhelpsquad/fsy3d/mozilla-firefox 

Inspiration/Innovation/Invention: 
Are we inspiring to bring in something totally new (watch for soulful emotions), are we describing how to put it together and formulate it (watch for mindful thinking), are we discussing how to put it together and build it (watch for physical tangible get-it-done action) 

Dialogue/Discussion/Debate: 
This article best describes how most of our group work resides within discussion and debate and rarely does dialogue (the source of new inspiration through collective mind) show up as we have been untaught this critical way. See https://skitch.com/virtualhelpsquad/fsbye/communication-differentiating-debate-discussion-and-dialogue-post-fuel-for-discovering-sustainable-innovation

cc Gunasekar C Rajaratnam Ralf Lippold Mark Frazier Really nice piece by the Next Edge's own Jennifer Sertl, The Individuation of Ideas (h/t John Hagel).

It makes me think of science and "intellectual property." Why do some scientists so hoard their work and ideas instead of sharing them more completely? How can we really "own" the product of a myriad links in a chain of unknown origins? Apologies if this is a repost ... reminded me of David Hodgson's post from his home in England a week or so ago... http://www.linkedin.com/news?actionBar=&articleID=742978414&ids=0QcjgUdPAOd3sIdz0VdzcRdjgTb38OdPsOc3cQdOMMdj4Nc3kOd3sId3sQcj4PdjgT&aag=true&freq=weekly&trk=eml-tod-b-ttle-68&ut=0W4JA4jMg_qAU1 Ode to the black swans in the house:

They are at the forefront of the Open Education Movement and their membership will be immensely valuable to Next Edu Can you take your idea for social change, turn it into a Hollywood story, and then cram it into a 25-word pitch? And why would you?

If you're trying to get people outside of Next Edge to buy into your idea, a 25-Word Hollywood pitch might just do the trick. The story adds emotional resonance. This something we talked about in last week in a G+ Hangout with Kate Michi Ettinger, Curtis Faith, Seb Pacquet and Suresh Fernando. I have written about the story mechanics that make it work (See: http://www.billiamjames.com/25-words/), but if you just want the 25-word template here it is:

A flawed hero [Your Customer]
Urgently needing change [Customer Needs]
Overcomes huge obstacles and powerful enemies [Established Limitations]
And learns how to open the door [Product Feature]
To a happy ending. [Product Benefit]

Adapt as needed, and change the world in 25 words or less... Please reach out to the group of young people who worked tirelessly for 10 weeks after being picked out of 2500 applicants to generate solutions for the future of humanity at Singularity University. One of them is Arturo Pelayo, a young man I have been mentoring for 4 years. This is their innovation project. Please could anyone with the connections connect them to VC's please.  http://matternet.net/ Climate change may offer humanity a healing crisis opportunity — Transition Voice http://bit.ly/q4MnEp by Daniel Pinchbeck WOW! ... The Next Edge conversations have BURST! It seems the dialogue enegry has shifted from 'despair' to 'design' ... what's happening here?! ... how wonderful! 

It would be interesting experiment to build on this effort by creating a design movement that takes us from: 

1- independent ideas and insights (seems we've all been working on this one for a long time) TO 
2- converging concepts and information (where i see things are at right now) TO 
3- interdependent knowledge and synthesis (this is where things usually die through challenged ego) TO 
4- applied integrated sustainable solutions (the outcome of real collaboration).

http://prezi.com is an example of a cool online medium for integrating and synthesizing all of this amazing passion, energy, and knowledge - with the goal of designing a plan that allows for multiple 'barns' to be raised. 

Here's my two cents on the community transformation: from inspiration to innovation to inventive action. http://discoveryfuel.com/collaborative-design/innovation-a-three-phase-transformation-process/ How true is that? Let me say at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love! Che Guevara Is anyone here building or using a platform that is designed for serious discussion between varied concerned individual members of the technical top tier (tech, science, wonks, buisness), but outside of what I'm terming 'the control class' (which would include big 6 media, FB, Google, Political parties)? I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here so feel free to rephrase the question. Curtis Faith  before today "stay" was the most lovely phrase I had ever heard. Now "NextEdge's own" - I got teary in feeling of belonging that your kindness expressed today w/Individuation of ideas. Inclusion and the need to belong are such vital aspects of trust & community.

In my #gratitude I'd like to express myself through poetry as that is where my soul shines through. I give to you and to NextEdge the poignant Mary Oliver's Wild Geese:

You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting --
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.
****

Repeat: whoever you are, no mater how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination . . .

Thank you all, NextEdge.
Love & Light,
Jennifer is anyone in Montreal going to this? (looking in Seb's direction..) Greetings, I was invited to this group due to a recent e-book published from a co-created thesis.

Dana ON ECOSYSTEMS: As we move into a more networked world where individuals are connected across organizational boundaries, it becomes increasingly more important (and reasonable!) to start thinking about things from a Systems perspective; to to think about groups of projects and people, and to think about structuring our processes, models, infrastructure and institutions from this perspective; with the realization that organizational boundaries are more permeable than ever before. 

With this in mind, and in the context of work that I was doing at the time I drafted the following provisional definition of an Ecosystem (<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/a//document/pub?id=1caHoCllfgIWN7-wx4R7NsfXMXT3rN2g4uWWEOH9z3pM&amp;embedded=true"></iframe>)

This has implications for those that are a part of the Trans Organizational Collaboration Group: Curtis Faith Lauren Higgins Kate Michi Ettinger Gunasekar C Rajaratnam Seb Paquet Mushin Schilling

This work was applied directly to a project within the Open Manufacturing Ecosystem (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AiJ9wl9qbZEzdGRYY2YzRlhHemVMT3ZFd1otSHp0anc&output=html), where I both worked on gathering specific project data from members of the OM Ecosystem (to facilitate matching between projects), as well as worked with four specific projects on figuring out how to bring them together collaboratively. Check out the various tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

This, therefore, constitutes a case study in Trans Org Collaboration amongst early stage projects within an ecosystem (as defined above)... Anyway, this is one input into the pending Trans Org Collaboration discussion... Capitalism's engulfed by constant crises: are we at the end of the road now?

I've started a bookshelf for books written by NextEdgers. Add yours if you've written one! http://www.goodreads.com/group/bookshelf/52885?order=d&per_page=20&shelf=books-by-nextedgers&sort=date_added&view=main Next Edgers Unite at SOCAP! Come mingle at the edge with us before we walk over to SOCAP registration Tuesday evening. Great opportunity to get some face-to-face coherence time. This presentation is such a standout in terms of elegance and refined simplicity. I don't think I'd experienced aesthetic pleasure from a PPT before... Which NextEdgers do you miss most from the earlier days of this group? Why do you think they're no longer participating? Is there anyone in this group that feels that they understand the unique characteristics of Local Foods Ecosystems?... what challenges the unique stakeholders in this space need to solve to operate more efficiently. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm1c3l_8zo8&feature=youtube_gdata
Spirituality in higher education. Join the #SXSW conversation about what it means to Design for Social Entrepreneurship: http://bit.ly/nK0EWf (and vote for our panel!) What is the difference between a 'group' and a gathering place... a 'water-cooler' that allows for interaction and the exchange of ideas. Is one preferable over the other? this is the first thing i'd like to share with this group, and mainly because it has had few views but someone came across it today serenditously... considering this was my methodology 6 years ago, i wonder if it makes sense to people here, especially regarding our enthusiasm for things that interest us personally...? and it might explain why my comments appear to ome from left-field...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s66khkBWWNE&sns=tw Am I the only person that is not getting all relevant notifications? At the outset I would be notified of all activity related to both posts I originated or commented on. This seems to be the case no more. Maybe the algorithm changes as the group grows... if so, all the more reason to start thinking of alternative ways of interacting since I seem to be missing relevant activity. Why being passionate can be like a madness? Love is not altogether a delirium, yet it has many points in common therewith! - Thomas Carlyle Does anyone here know Simon Sinek? 

I keep coming back to the attached presentation of his in my thinking of what holds this group together.

Why?

What do we believe?

What beliefs do we hold in common?

This is the place to start. Our story of why.

As a related aside:
Tiberius - This is what is missing from the Multitudes project, from my limited perspective. Heads up those attending SOCAP. It's just around the corner! Couple things: 

1) Those coming from Canada/want to know Canadians who are working in the impact investing space here, do come out to our informal dinner on Tuesday, Sept 6th or on the morning of the 9th. See link below: 

http://socialfinance.ca/blog/post/money-meaning-and-much-more-at-socal-capital-markets-2011

2) I will be providing media coverage via SocialEarth.org and will be providing daily updates and live microblogging aka. tweets (@j_ling) throughout the conference. My pre-conference pieces are published and feature some awesome members of the NextEdge crew Sarah B Brooks Jessica Margolin Follow the posts here: 
http://www.socialearth.org/author/jocelynl

Let me know in the comments if you are looking for specific coverage of sth, or to see someone interviewed. I'll do my best (and any intros would help too!) 

3) I know there was a google doc floating around somewhere on the people attending SOCAP from here and our availabilities...I'm looking at David Hodgson aka. super connector,  that you probably know what's up with that? Any updates? I propose an informal Wednesday dinner! =) 

Looking forward to being at SOCAP and meeting alot of you in person!

Kenneth Boulding PROPOSED NEW FACEBOOK GROUP: Trans Organizational Collaboration: Further to yesterday's Generating Coherence call, Kate Michi Ettinger, having participated in all three Generating Coherence calls, identified the theme of collaboration across organizational boundaries as a converging area of interest. Curtis Faith and myself are currently working directly in this area so I am very interested in connecting with and collaborating with others with this interest. Lauren Higgins and Bert-Ola Bergstrand also expressed an interest in this area.I propose that we set up a separate Facebook Group as Seb Paquet has done for those interested in the New Currency space in order to provide the group with maximum flexibility. I propose that this be set up as a 'secret' (like this group) working group that requires people be nominated and seconded before being added to the group. This is the same model that the New Currency group is using. The reason I suggest this is that I propose that it be a Working Group that, at the outset has the intention of defining specific goals, milestones, processes etc. I propose this because Converging on specific goals etc. is one of  the central challenges in the  Trans Organizational Collaboration space. This working group then, if it moves forward as proposed, would operate at two levels... 1) identifying, evaluating, researching tools, processes etc. related to Trans Org Collab...2) working together to find ways to converge on goals etc...3) meta level analysis of our own use of tools processes etc as well as what is working and what the challenges are.... We will be our own guinea pigs so to speak! Having tried this before, I strongly suggest that this not be a wide open group, but that it be limited to those that have demonstrated domain expertise in this area or are moving into this area... anyone in Next Edge that wants to participate please identify yourself... What do you think? Does anyone have an easel (or more than one) used to display art at SoCap next week? Please message me. in sf Here is an example of a shift in principle - i.e. a change in the way of thinking about ecosystems within urban areas: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/business/global/an-urban-jungle-for-the-21st-century.html How much of our society appreciates root problems of cascading global crises and the looming systemic risk of interlinked financial markets? I took three days unplugged. Amazing what the quiet will teach you. As I re-engage in the world and particularly at NextEdge I am struck by how much our conversation mirrors the dynamics of the DNA strand. I have been following and learning from Bruce Lipton http://www.brucelipton.com/ for the past five years. He discovered that Watson & Crick were partially correct in their discovery of DNA but that they under-estimated the value of the juice the strands swam in. The DNA strands hold the data--but the 'juice' provides switching information. Here on NextEdge we have real nuggets of wisdom, clear strands of brilliance. We also have poetry, recognition, celebrating accomplishments, unfulfilled dreams, ambition, and lonelines and pure joy. It is amazing how art imitates life or life imitates art. We are DNA. We are alive. We are the dance between raw data and raw emotion. May we continue to thrive and value how both contribute to discovery . . . Hidden within every facet arranged is a system smaller still until matter is resolved by the strangeness of quantum mechanics. We find hydrogen whole, and we observe how this atom does exert influence. But the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the center of a sports arena, and the electrons that orbit the parking lot disappear into a sort of fuzz. The proton is again largely nothing; the quark is some assembly of energy below. Ours is not an existence of permanence but of systems and relationships. I am a speck of conscious multiverse. I am wholes combined. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

It seems to me that for any new party to gain traction, there needs to be some impetus, some event, some emotional trigger. Do you agree?

If so, what do you envision as that impetus?

Steve Brant - You've mentioned wanting to run for president? Why? Why do you think you'd be a good candidate? What makes you believe that others here would support you? Why do you think U.S. politics is a useful process to engage in its current form? This might have been posted before, but in light of recent topics many of you will find this worth your time to listen to.
http://youtu.be/tyayCoYMCEY Porter has been quoted recently as saying capitalism needs to be redefined. This blog post on the topic was interesting enough to share. Thoughts? Hello everyone...so honored to be a part of this online community! A general model to consider: http://singularityhub.com/2011/08/29/a-video-game-that-teaches-you-to-make-video-games-code-hero-rocks-maker-faire-next-the-world/ I fail to understand people who say that we talk a lot and do nothing about it.
Trust me, my purpose of talking or reading posts and comments here is to act. 
I have quit short term rewarding consultancy work and will exhaust my lat bit of savings in a week. I do not have any other source of income nor do I have any debts yet. My needs are limited. My wife and kids have a roof over their head and a monthly income of less than $500/- that keeps the pot boiling . I will not however be pressured into accepting work that does not fit in with my own set of decisions I have been taking and have drawn a lot of inspiration from this group.

I'll be in SFO for a long weekend after SOCAP and would love to meet up with some edgers. My total stay will be the 5th-13th. I don't want to get into a habit of posting my own stuff up here, but I would be curious about people's thoughts on the ideas I'm exploring in this piece - that the current focus on maximizing wealth for shareholders might well one day lead us to corporations run entirely by software. Science fiction? Maybe, but I'm starting to wonder... Does anyone know of any open source global outcome simulation games?... would be cool to play one together! Today's map.

Hartzog Lauren Higgins Seb Paquet Mark Frazier Venessa Miemis Flemming Funch Jennifer Sertl Michel Bauwens and others (see comment) have self identified as attending Contact. From my perspective, one of the most important features of Contact is the ability to meet and deepen relationships. I also believe that if we connect in advance, the likelihood of this happening is increased.

If you are interested in arranging a Hangout, here are a few things we could collectively explore:
1. Intros and current projects
2. Accommodation sharing
3. Arranging 1 on 1 meetings before Contact
4. Topics we can jointly present on... since this is unconference format, the more people recruiting to single topic the better.
5. Fun stuff to do in NY!

And so on ;-) Does anyone here know Sasha Dichter, director of business development for the Acument fund?

I've been reading his blog for quite some time. It sure seems he'd be a good person to brainstorm with about the future of philanthropy and scaling both the input side (ala crowdsourcing) and the output side via some vetting and aggregation mechanisms that can efficiently mobilize and track the effectiveness of capital investments. Thanks for making me a member. An invitation to self-organize:  Just a quick loop back to the Next Edge community about themes emerging in the generating coherence calls... as there are many people on the track list who have also expressed interest in these areas.   

Curtis Faith and David Hodgson have enabled infrastructure for self-organization and if other resources emerge as preferable by all means - use them... this is what was here this morning.

Have fun! Some musings. Human endeavor follows four main divisions: Mind, Body, Heart and Soul. 

Mind is where sense making and knowledge meet in wisdom.

Body is where strength and flexibility meet in structure.

Heart is where inspiration and art meet in culture.

Soul is where history meets future in the in the present.

Is there any aspect of human endeavor outside of these four divisions?

Rootedness is complete balance in having been.

Consciousness is complete balance in being. 

Wisdom is complete balance in becoming.

Is there anything beyond the past, present and future? This is in response to Inma's post:

Ok, I know I'm being cynical. But here's my perspective:

I've been (and still am) involved in several think-tanks with similar types of goals. Everyone is energetic, inspiring, and has all of these lofty goals about how to create a better society. I want all of that. Really badly. 

But what I find is a lot of talking and philosophizing over coffee or cocktails, feeling enlightened... and then everyone goes back to their 9-5 jobs and life carries on as usual until the next little inspiring talk. 

I am impatient. I can't sit around talking any more, and doing so makes me increasingly frustrated with everything and everyone in the world. So I've realized that not everyone feels my same sense of urgency; not everyone is as passionate about my issues-of-interest as I am. And I realize that the biggest impact I can have is on a smaller scale, because in huge think tanks, it takes SO LONG for anything to come to fruition.

I received an email a few days ago, out of the blue, from the mother of my very first client, just to tell me how much I meant to them. I worked that little guy, one on one,  from the time he was 3 years old, until he was 11, and I moved away from Milwaukee—he was like a son to me, and I was part of his family, as far as he was concerned. (He is the child I wrote about in my Scientific American article on increasing intelligence) 

I had a profound impact on his life. I broke all the rules, I took chances with therapy, I paved a new road in that genre of teaching that other therapists picked up on and continued to use long after I moved away. I started out with the goal of helping one child. And I did. And I had other clients over the years that had similar stories. So maybe I directly taught several dozen kids with my intense treatment/teaching, but I influenced others to take similar initiatives, leading by example. 

I threw a pebble, and it created small ripples. Not huge waves, but ripples. But each ripple is a real child, who will now live a better life because I got out there, took one first step, and decided I was going to make a difference, no matter how small. So that’s how I go about things. Yes, I have big dreams, too. Oh, so big. But I also realize that if I were to sit around in a think tank and discuss the ideas I had for therapy instead of actually implementing them—I’d still be talking, and those children would be worse off. 

I do appreciate all of the enthusiasm of this group, and it is inspiring, but I need more action. Talking isn’t cutting it anymore; not when I’ve already seen the kind of direct impact I can have by taking those steps, not matter how small. 
So, I’m sorry if I am the “realist” here, but I am too impatient to sit around and talk for a few more years. I need to get shit done. Kids are waiting. As per the 'Next Edge' guidelines above: 

1. I've made the decision to re-act an old plan that I'd like to bring back to life called "CHANGING NORMAL". 
2. It has been started many years ago, but has been dormant. To advance the cause I will put it out there again to see what happens. 
3. I am asking for help now - to bury the seeds of passion and money in order that this project may grow and move into manifestation. 
4. Ask and yee shall receive.
5. I'm doin' it; I'm doin' it!

Many times we talk about our projects or what we want to do... but I miss to hear about... which are your goals, your big challenges? Could we make here a looooong list to know the goals - challenges - big problems we want to solve around the world? Thank you!! <3 Could the Next Edge be, or enable, the Living WE? What infrastructure could we help set up to create the conditions for the positive to emerge. What manifesto could we write to guide our journey? Greetings from Las Vegas. No time to respond to all the recent posts, but wanted to alert you all to how seriously the Nobel Prize winning Al Gore takes the anti-science Republican element in American politics today.  He has pushed back against their belief system Big Time... and I agree completely with his strategy: to Change The Story!

http://readersupportednews.org/off-site-opinion-section/60-60/7228-right-wing-livid-over-al-gores-climate-remarks Very interesting write-up:
http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs181/English Invited Rob Smart one of the biggest innovators in the sustainable food systems space I have had the pleasure to meet. He just posted on the hive mind....so I thought he might enjoy being invited to this hive. For more of what he does check out: http://www.thesnapvt.com/ What are the implications of openness? One important feature of the radically open world that we are moving towards are the more 'human' aspects of openness. I would argue that being highly open on a personal level is aligned with a greater ability to form trust and a greater level of personal courage, for example. Since openness is a feature of the Next Edge (world we are moving towards), this established a link between the personal, more human, level and the societal level... which, at the least, seems interesting to me... What is our story?

Why are we here? What do we hope to accomplish?

All around us the signs of a system that is breaking down, and our societies are like a nation-sized ice shelfs breaking loose from the shores of Antarctica drifting out to sea, no longer connected in the same way. No long anchored to the Earth.

We need stories to keep hope alive and to supply the context for our combined and individual action. What is our story for the future?

What will we tell our children? How does one add someone to this particular Edge? Which inconvenient truth will roil financial markets? IMF's Lagarde is right... the Eurozone banking crisis can't be swept under the carpet! http://www.truth-out.org/three-charts-email-your-right-wing-brother-law/1314626142 Since we're speaking about action here... (I copied/pasted this from G+)

Know of a science mentoring organization? Add it to the list! Last week's August Science Online NYC meeting was about how to reach underserved and niche groups with science communication, such as children. This prompted a discussion of the various science outreach and mentoring programs that target kids specifically. We'd love your help in adding to this list. 

From +Lou Woodley, organizer of the event:

In response to a suggestion made at the August Science Online NYC discussion, we’re starting a collection of organizations that will link young students with scientists who are willing to volunteer to act as mentors. Please add your suggestions below.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/08/28/ai-weiwei-on-beijing-s-nightmare-city.html @Mark Klein from the MIT Centre for Collective Intelligence, is working on an interesting project, the Deliberatorium, that might have implications for this group. He has submitted the project to the MIX Management competition and is looking for comments... I looked pretty closely at this project about a year ago. It is interesting and might have implications for this group... 

The Deliberatorium is a software tool designed to help organizations better harvest the knowledge and incorporate the perspectives of their members to identify solutions for complex problems, avoiding the dysfunctional behaviors (such as noise, disorganized content, and polarization) that other social media often produce when applied to challenging topics.

http://www.managementexchange.com/hack/deliberatorium-hack Mark, David, Helene: Hmm, individualism.
In year 10 of being a “participant observer” of and in US society, here is an attempt at articulation:
Yes, there is a form of “generative individualism” – which seems to exist, in its “traditional” form, when community is present through such notions as neighborliness or local self-organization.  For example, as the legacies of pioneering and remote distances here in the Mountain West.  Structures are perceived as small enough that an understanding of human commonality and engagement in them is viable.  There is still enough culturally common understanding of both self-help and community to make this work (my ranch-our church, my business-our town, my house-our community).

At the other end of the spectrum, in a “post-modern” (?) form, I see people who have themselves internally integrated fairly high levels of complexity, often left their original communities, and arrived at an understanding of themselves as having agency (high levels of self-directedness) and self-leadership, in combination with the insight that meaningful action is linked to contribution and creation, as well as generative interaction with others. Here, individuality eventually is re-connected to community , which is seen as an act of choice.

Now, to the other individualism, maybe “atavistic individualism” by name. In this, I see phenomena such as isolation, as well as a stance of obliviousness towards the impact of one’s actions on others, and/or distrust and very low or negative expectations regarding human relationships (and the nature of other people).

I don’t believe that individualism-collectivism is entirely helpful as a juxtaposition. For humans to thrive, a healthy balance between the individual and the group/collective needs to exist. There are many different ways this healthy balance can show up.
My critique of a society that expects “post-modern individualism” of most of its members is that it requires very significant resources, both intellectual and even more so in terms of emotional growth and personal development. For many people, this path of engaging a “world without rules” is not the one taken, leading instead either to “atavistic individualism”, psychological dysfunction or forms of new tribalism (reduce complexity, enhance belonging, just be safe).

 I might make a go of articulating my perspectives on collectivism (as used in cross-cultural terminology) in another post, based on life-experiences in Asia, as they ofter a very different way of framing our thinking. The new issue of The Evolving Daily Planet is out

http://www.americanprogress.org/pressroom/advisories/2011/08/nces_advisory.html While Irene's wet, deadly, expensive, with nature's mercy it wasn't a total monster. Key question: Are we prepared for climate chaos crises? What exactly is the problem with leadership? i'm in the UK at the moment, visiting family on the south coast who live in a somewhat rural, small, middle class town. And it feels much as it always has. No sense of imminent catastrophe, urgency or fear. If I didn't know any better I would think all was well with the world. No sense of any need to change, no sense that life will not just amble on in the same way forever... it is both disconcerting and oddly comforting. I just contributed to the Human Project on Kickstarter, but I'd also like to open a dialogue here about the direction of our species that doesn't sound like it's included in their plans.

It has to do with the rapid evolution we are undergoing which is creating a capacity shift for humanity that changes all the rules we currently take for granted in our industrial age economy and completes our shift into completely different information age dynamics.

We have an anthropocentric notion of intelligence. Consider, for a moment, the cells in our body. They communicate, collaborate, share scarce resources, work together to build, maintain and manage extremely complex systems, and each one carries a copy of the agreements (DNA) that they use to cooperate.  Cells do all those things better than we do, yet we don't recognize that as intelligence.  

But what would happen if humanity had a breakthrough in our capacities to do these kinds things together because of the advent of new kinds of "Social DNA?"  Social DNA which enables rapid self-organization, organizational adaptation, resource allocation, communication, decision-making and new patterns of collective governance...

What if these breakthroughs freed us from the inefficiencies of bureaucracy, the inequities of centralized financial instruments and computing architectures, and the ineffectiveness of representational hierarchies?

What would the Human Project look like then?  

This is actually happening. And it's a game changer. We're building it now.

What kind of futures do you see possible with this and other new capacities? Additional evidence that time is running short and that the EU may unravel.  Will a bold solution be offered in time? For all of you who are into digital curation, this is a must read. Great piece from Maria Popova. Are you safe and well? Great to note hurricane Irene hasn't been as destructive as originally envisaged by the US fed, state & city admins. I wrote a post about the development of an internet enabled gift economy tool a few months ago, but didn't have the right place to post it for feedback. I just realized Next Edge may be just the place! Here is the meat of the post: 
"In order to empower the qualiitative economy, we will need a tool which unifies the single points of reputational currency in various forms scattered across the digital landscape. This aggregate of currencies shares what we give and take within our associated communities. This qualitative currency wall would portray a more complete picture of who we are (what we do) in digital form and could provide a basis for facilitating both quantitative and qualitative as well as online and offline transactions."

Excerpts from A Simpler Way
a book by Margaret J. Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers
.
There is a simpler way to organize human endeavor.
It requires a new way of being in the world.
It requires being in the world without fear.
Being in the world with play and creativity.
Seeking after what's possible.
Being willing to learn and be surprised.

This simpler way to organize human endeavor
requires a belief that the world is inherently orderly.
The world seeks organization.
It does not need us humans to organize it.

This simpler way summons forth what is best about us.
It asks us to understand human nature differently,
more optimistically. It identifies us as creative.
It acknowledges that we seek after meaning.
It does not separate play from the nature of being.

The world of a simpler way is a world we already know. We may not have seen it clearly,
but we have been living in it all our lives.
It is a world that is more welcoming,
more hospitable to our humanness.
Who we are and what is best about us
can more easily flourish.

The world of a simpler way has a natural
and spontaneous tendency toward organization.
It seeks order. Whatever chaos is present at the start,
when elements combine, systems of organization appear.

Life is attracted to order--
order gained through wandering explorations
into new relationships and new possibilities.
Life is creative. As it tinkers with discovery,
it creates more and more possibilities.

With so much freedom for discovery,
how can life be anything but playful?

Life is about invention, not survival.
We are here to create, not to defend.
Out beyond the shadows of darwinistic thought,
a wholly different world appears.
A world that delights in explorations.
A world that makes it up as it goes along.
A world that welcomes us into the exploration
as good partners.

Everything is in a constant process
of discovery and creating.
Everything is changing all the time:
individuals, systems, the environment,
the rules, the processes of evolution.
Even change changes.

Tinkering opens us up to what’s possible in the moment.
Analytic plans drive us only toward what we already know.

We believe that answers already exist
out there, independent of us.
We don’t need to experiment to find out what
works; we just need to find out the answer.
So we look to other organizations,
or to experts, or to reports.
We are dedicated detectives, tracking down solutions,
attempting to pin them on ourselves and our organizations.

What if we invested more time and
attention in our own experimentation?
We could focus our efforts on discovering
solutions that worked uniquely for us.
We could focus on what’s viable, rather than what’s right.

Playful and creative enterprises are messy and redundant.
Parallel systems are dedicated to finding what works,
not by careful stepwise analysis in the hands
of a few experts, but by large numbers of a population
messing about in the task of solution-creation.

Fuzzy, messy, continuously exploring systems
bent on discovering what works are far more
practical than our attempts at efficiency.
The system succeeds because it involves
many tinkerers focusing on figuring out what’s possible.
The solution is discovered through the doing,
by noticing “the shape things will take to come forth in.”

The more present we are as individuals and
organizations, the more choices we create.
As awareness increases, we can
engage with more possibilities.
We are no longer held prisoner by habits, unexamined
thoughts, or information we refuse to look at.

Yet we often tend to limit our expectations
of what’s possible by surrounding ourselves
with large amounts of information that tell us nothing new.
They don’t ask us to question
why we’re doing what we’re doing.
They don’t ask us to notice what learning is
available from all those things we decided not to measure.

In a creative organization, everyone in the
organization feels compelled to be alert,
seeking out new measures, new events to observe.
Our consciousness expands as we become willing
to question even our processes of observation.
Consciousness and creativity are inextricably
linked in this always discovering world.

Our first task is to see the world differently.
We need to observe processes that
we either ignored or cannot see.
To support natural processes of organization,
we must first change our beliefs.
We give up believing that we design the world into existence
and instead take up roles in support of its flourishing.

We work with what is available and
encourage forms to come forth.
We foster tinkering and discovery.
We help create connections.
We nourish with information.
We stay clear about what we want to accomplish.
We remember that people self-organize
and trust them to do so.
We work with organizing-as-process
rather than organizations-as-object.
We reframe our thinking about responsibilities.

In self-organizing systems structure emerges,
it’s not imposed. 
They spring from the process of doing the work.
The structures will be useful but temporary.
They can be expected to emerge and recede as needed.
It’s not the design that requires our attention
but rather the conditions that support
the emergence of necessary structures.

Organizations keep searching for ties that bind them
--new incentives, rewards, punishments.
But organizations could accomplish
so much more if they relied on the passion
evoked when we connect to others, purpose to purpose.

Until the system forms, we have very limited
knowledge of what might emerge.
The only way to know a system is to play with it.
Instead of defining what’s right for a system
and then struggling to impose it,
we learn to say, “Let’s see.” Is anyone here actively involved in fourth sector initiatives in the US? A year and a month ago I wrote this essay about objects. Hope y'all enjoy. On Scale and the problems we pick.... I find it interesting...thinking about the scope of what some of you are trying to address...as compared to the scope of what I am trying to address. For me one HUGE disconnect, at least in US culture - is the lack of contact between neighbors. I lived in the Bay Area most of my life and recall speaking to neighbors on either side less than 3 times. THAT is the rift I am aiming to heal. Sure there are vegetables involved but what I am really about is revivifying the concept of the neighborhood where it has died. So I mention this because HOW we choose to intervene here is interesting to me. I see so many proposals for more software systems...having worked in software for more years than I would like to mention (as it's ironically likely to make me unemployable) I find myself more and more bemused by the idea that the problem is a software problem...and not a wetware one. I am finding software a clumsy tool....but perhaps I just need a decent ruby developer. What I believe is fundamental in any civilization that is going to work for most of its participants, or in any heterogeneous group for that matter, is some kind of meta-agreement that makes it possible to disagree with each other, without it being a problem. Something quite a bit like the Open Space principles. If some people want to do A and others want to do B, no problem, the A group finds a good corner where they can work on it, and the B group meets under the oak tree in the garden. If anybody changes their mind, they can at any time choose to go somewhere else, start a group C, or just hang around and do nothing. None of it is any problem, unless the sentiment arises that there's supposed to be one right thing to do, or one right way to look at it, and that this somehow needs to be fought out and settled in the public square, and everybody needs to feel the same way about it.

This is particularly likely to become a problem in a group that has one main gathering place. Like here. We're 500 people who're posting into the same shared space. At the same time we're also gathering in corners for specialized projects. But we share this space here, and it is somewhat scarce. We have somewhat limited time and attention. What if there were 10 times as many members? What if somebody started hogging the space? What if some members had viewpoints you seriously don't agree with? So far there has been little conflict, just some slight hints that we don't all agree on everything. Then again, we maybe haven't yet gotten into the nitty-gritty of doing very much yet. What when we do? What if some of us are extremely passionate about something really controversial?

I'm looking for maybe forming a more explicit meta-agreement of some kind. The most simple and general of agreements. Not an ambitious manifesto or a grand action plan or anything like that. Just a few simple rules. The rules for Open Space could work, if we don't have a better idea. Just so that when the hint of disagreement shows up we can say "Ah, no problem! We're just working on different things, from different perspectives." Instead of getting into an argument about whether Back To Nature or Orbiting Mega Arcologies is the right way to go, or whether we're Socialists or Libertarians, we can recognize that we don't have to agree. It is maybe different things that make us tick, and it is maybe different worlds that we're creating. But we can still share a framework. The framework is the only thing we'd have to agree on.

Is this feasible? Lest you should think that there are no Present and Past thinkers in the world, here is a private community we mapped. A bit different from ours. Hi David, here is some musing about the degree fear does and does not serve us. Amped-up nervous systems (an imbalance which is "chronic disease" in most of the US population) lead to all kinds of fatigue and physical illness symptoms. Without relaxation and calming capacities, people are not at their most resourceful, let alone resilient, in times of change. I strongly believe that weaning people off their states over-excitation is a significant part of strengthening the ability to think and act in a more centered and impactful manner - especially when there are "objective" reasons for concern about the state of things.  

A German proverb says "In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft" (In calm, there is strength). Maybe an insight derived from a long history of surviving calamities?

Sabine Had a long long back and forth discussion with Vinay Gupta over the last few days on Twitter that highlighted some differences in perspective on the relative value of collective versus individual action and planning.

I had been thinking that we, everyone working to make the worldbetter, needed a common plan which, I envisioned not as some top-down imposed plan, but rather the collection of each of our respective individual plans. If it was made visible in one place, it seemed to me that this would make it easier for anyone to understand what else was going on, and where they might be able to do the most to forward their particular best work.

Vinay made me realize that the very idea of a plan is anathema to many, and especially to many whose work is making an important difference for our prospects as a human species. So I peppered him with probes and questions in an effort to understand this view better.

At the end, the discussion, and after reading the discussion on leadership here: http://atlumschema.com/atlumschema/be-a-leader-follow-the-crowd/, I realized that plan was the wrong word.

What we really need is a living map of the territory which stands between where we are and where we hope to get. A constantly updated view of the mountains we wish to climb, and some hints as to the best ways found so far to climb them and to get around the various obstacles along the way.

We don't need leaders, leading is a loaded word that hints at power relationships that harm more than help. We don't need leaders, because then someone will have to follow. We don't need leaders, we need fellow travelers.

We need scouts like Vinay to forge ahead and tell us what is out there, and mapmakers to chart our knowledge of the terrain and paths, and bridge builders to help others cross streams, and demolition experts to dig tunnels where necessary, and... Back to independence? Anna Hazare, anti-corruption Gandhian, ends his 12-day fast before thousands of cheering supporters in Delhi, India...

http://www.facebook.com/note.php?saved&&note_id=355178658865 Based on the latest, Hurricane Irene is on a path to become possibly the most destructive and disruptive storm most have seen in a lifetime. Hurricane Irene has left 1+ million homes and businesses without power. As power stations shut, it takes time to bring them back up again... This is pretty revolutionary. I see the next iteration of the Web as 'subject-oriented' and people-centric, and this new UK approach to personal control of data is an illustration. Horrifying to watch burnt out bodies and skeletons of Libyans killed by pro-Gaddafi forces during siege of Tripoli. We pray for world peace. We are sorry to learn of the deaths caused by hurricane Irene. We pray for all the millions in her path & hope that nature will show mercy. The latest issue of The Evolving Daily Planet is out. (Is anyone else using paper.li?  Are you all okay if I post each day's edition here? Thanks for letting me know.)

http://paper.li/SteveBrant/1309745607 Well, we are up to 42 members of this group now mapped in the world of thinking. And, so far. It's still looking like a very Future thinking group. The issues with this is one of breadth of world view, or the lack thereof, that provides for a well-balanced and multi-perspective discussion. Not that there is anything wrong with our possibility perceiving group (as curious as it is when imbued with the Past thinkers we have).

It would be nice to have more of the Next Edge represented, I suspect we have a broader perceptual style than is being shown. Would anyone like to tally the mapped members (just log into our mindtime map and see the list of mapped members below the group map), with the group's conversation participants (what percentage of people in the conversations are represented in the map?) We know that we do not have 560 people posting and responding.

217167764329204376830.0004aaf122993f46df304 Working on a definition for "Social Entrepreneurship", i found a quote from Geof Cox: 

"The key point here is that the ‘official’ social enterprise sector is based on the dated model of ‘the firm’, rather than the new reality of the network, on mitigating market failure rather than developing a whole new way of organising human affairs, and on conventional business growth models rather than the now rather more pressing issue of the limits to growth. We have to shift to a new paradigm. This means shifting focus from the relatively small number of social enterprises that happen to fit an official definition"

- Anyone have any thoughts on this? A Climate Change Collective Intelligence Project... this is pretty cool... http://climateinteractive.org/ Glad to welcome Larry White and Warren Coats to Next Edge! Look forward to their insights on alt-currencies re the New Currency and other tracks cc John Hagel Jim Rutt Jordan Greenhall Chris Cook Gregory Rader Arthur Brock Hello fellow Edglings. Grateful for the chance to dive in catch up on all the good stuff that's been happening in here the last week. :) 

Also wanted to let you all know, hoping it will be of interest, that I've submitted a concept for an OpenIDEO challenge, to help them increase the social impact of their open online platform. The concept is based on one I'm currently prototyping in Melbourne (Australia), based out of Hub Melbourne (part of the global Hub Network).

It will serve as a social enterprise incubator and provide events and programs to support and develop networks of change-makers. It will complement the OpenIDEO online offering and partner with the global Hub network (or similar communities) for online and face-to-face collaboration. I'm hoping that if IDEO pick it up as a project to develop, it will facilitate and accelerate successful implementation, replication and scaling.

Would love to hear your thoughts and advice on how we can help make this happen (with our without OpenIDEO) and if you know of any similar groups or organisations doing something similar. 

And if you're so inclined, please applaud (vote).

Application deadline: September 16 What is the relationship between gaming and emergent open environments... like Next Edge? @Dave Pollard mentioned stopping the tar sands from flowing. I can think of some other worthy targets like this as well: stopping the building for more coal power plants, converting at least half of all power using entities to distributed solar/wind net-metered grid. So, how do we seriously apply our collective intelligence, and collective energies towards these kinds of problems? I am going to echo Dave's sentiment and ask if people here are interested in taking on these issues, which are arguably the most important we face now as a species? This is a VERY interesting article on the depletion of willpower through choices we make throughout the day. I am working with a dear friend on launching a brand called "Being Human" which will be curating content like this, and pointing people back to reflecting on what different scientific research like this feel's like in our experience. I think this stands to be a very needed resource in our highly conceptual world. Thoughts? Sorry for proliferating further posts, but in the spirit of a conversation that began on Dave Pollard's post, I would like to do something aimed at uncovering everyone's implicit theory of how change on a meaningful scale could happen. So here it is, a bit artificial but still useful I think: 
"If someone gave you $100MM to fund a single large-scale initiative, relating to the broad goals you share with others on this group and which you would work on, what would you choose to fund and why? The rule is that you can only fund one initiative (artificial constraint recognized) but it can scale any way you want and you are allowed a pilot period after which the design is more or less set." Have at it! We must not cease from exploration. The end of our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time! Eliot Tony Lai, I've been diving into Chris Cook's gamechanging ideas on how debt-burdened property markets can revive.  Would a LawGives/Next Edge global toolkit for this be possible? http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisJCook/community-partnerships-23-05-09?src=related_normal&rel=7829187 (value also for Kevin Lyons project on Law Clubs & Free Cities, I think) cc Sam Rose Kate Michi Ettinger Landon Synnestvedt Jim Rutt Are there any funders in the Next Edge Group other than Kevin Jones?

I really like this call to action by NextEdger Ross Dawson. Regardless of if you see yourself as a futurist on NextEdge or not, it WE cannot transcend boundaries at the edge--where is hope? Fascinating comparison of Steve Jobs and Tim Cook... using Word Clouds from the two commencement speeches they gave... welcome, Marc Canter. now with almost 550 people in the group, many are keen to find better ways to express their needs/wants/desires/offerings and discovering ways to align around similar projects/goals/initiatives, and generally just be collectively smarter together. i had suggested that perhaps the platform you're developing would be a more appropriate place for such a thing to happen instead of facebook. Interesting article about the future of collective thinking - suggests the limitations of words and language.  I disagree in that most people tend not to be telepathically endowed - the next step I think is story and metaphorical language which helps to transcend so much of the layered complexity, and which will also take it to a much deeper, richer and more playful level, as well as help others relate and engage. http://www.fastcompany.com/1775687/leadership-lessons-from-burning-man It seems the documents list is getting out of control. Suggest we consider deprecating all the documents except one and moving them all to the wiki.

The order in the documents list seems to be based on last update time and not order of importance. This must be confusing to new people as they won't know where to start to figure out how to best work within the existing context and conventions.

If we have one document: "Welcome to the Next Edge" in the docs list, it will always be at the top. That document can tell people about the wiki, and anything else which we think is useful for everyone coming in.

What do you think? This is truly a lovely echo chamber. But if its purpose is to give us hope then I'm worried. I think the real Next Edge is Beyond Hope (to steal a phrase from Derrick Jensen), the realization that our civilization is crashing fast, and that the attempts of the majority to hold on to it a bit longer are going to lead to some mighty ugly stuff (e.g. nukes and coal and razing forests) in the next few decades, before the inevitability of collapse and awareness of the true extent of the current great extinction become too obvious to keep ignoring. What I would like to see (here, or somewhere) are some ideas and discussion on how we can mitigate the worst effects of industrial civilization as descent escalates, and how we can come to grips emotionally with the incredible grief and sorrow we feel, and are going to feel a lot more, because of the staggering amount of suffering and desolation we have inflicted on our poor planet, and the realization that, now, the only way out is through, and through, especially for our children and grandchildren, is going to be harrowing and sometimes ghastly. Is that too much of a 'downer, doomer' message for this forum? Getting serious? Governor Cuomo just declared a state of emergency in New York in preparation for the potential impact of Hurricane Irene... A couple days ago I suggested people look at the Boston Innovation Hub as an example tool for organizing around shared goals. This article includes the hub and shows how I've been trying to connect people around a goal of helping youth in inner city poverty. http://tutormentor.blogspot.com  

Is there a way that members of groups like this could identify what cause they are working within and what country/city they focus on. It could be more than one. The goal is to try to create sub groups where people are looking at long-term collective efforts that put resources on the ground and apply the ideas we're all sharing in a constant process of innovation, action, evaluation, reflection and new innovation.  Maybe this is already available? If we wanted to start thinking about future scenarios as per Curtis Faith's Atlas of the Future idea from a long lost thread ;-)... what would the domain elements be? How would we describe the terrain? What would be analogous to trees, mountains, lakes and roads? The element set should be large enough that we can all represent the world we want to create... Not sure how to even start thinking about this problem... If Warren Buffett's intention was to put a floor under the share price of BoA at $7.14 via the warrants, isn’t this an awfully low floor? I get confused when people talk about Collective Intelligence. Do they mean in Tom Atlee fashion (http://www.co-intelligence.org/)? Or MIT Collective Intelligence (http://cci.mit.edu/)? John Francious Noubel's group in France (www.thetransitioner.org/)? Even Kevin Jones has http://www.collectiveintelligence.net/ - They all have that flavor of many people make greater wisdom... but they have quite different flavors/stories.

Each of us could offer up a dream of a possible future. Something concrete we believe we could accomplish as a group by the end of the year, December 31, 2011.

People are no longer subject to the control of the state. People can move faster than the state, people can out-think the state, people can be everywhere the state is not. 2011 is the year that we figured this out, and even if you took every mobile in Britain and threw them into the English Channel, this would not change."

http://www.startupamericapartnership.org/ Spent the day looking at toilets in slums - yuck I'm sure some of you will say, and that's my point. I've not worked on sanitation much; but   2.5 billion have no sanitation compared to "only" 1bn missing water or power.  Is that because of the Ick factor, how do we get people to look deeply at world problems with a serious ick factor (such as sanitation); or which are inconvenient/politicaly tough (e.g. getting people out of cars; overconsumption) This group needs a different forum.  After trying to follow on and off for a few weeks I think I can say conclusively that facebook groups are not well suited to a loosely organized group of 500+ people sharing at the rate people are here.  Comment threads from just yesterday now require multiple pages of scrolling to locate.  Conversations are fizzling too quickly because if no one comments for 60 minutes that thread might be pushed to the bottom of the page.  

Can anyone suggest a better technological alternative?  Perhaps this forum could remain as a holding container for initial invites and shallow conversation that then funnels people somewhere else for deeper conversation?

How likely do you think it is that we've ramped up the process of bootstrapping things together here after emergent percolation in the wider nets and Twitter?

It seems we have the critical social tools to make progress and keep improving those tools until we get exactly what we need over time. What do you think?

This group combined with a judicious use of other technologies, tied together more tightly over time and integrated into custom systems more tailored to our collective needs, it could do far more than we realize. How to fathom the wisdom of another? We judge of man's wisdom by his hope! - Ralph Waldo Emerson I've added a track for The Meta-Next Edge - for going deeper on understanding what TNE is and where it might be going. (Wiki login instructions are on the TNE Elsewhere doc.) i wasn't able to attend the meeting about a pooled investment experiment with next edgers via crewfund. are there any notes of the outcomes, Jay Standish? Are the 1-in-100 yr Virginia & Colorado earthquakes connected as is the Earth's magnetic pole shift? Why are volcanoes also more active? Y/N Another 100 year event? Largest natural earthquake in Colorado in 100 yrs struck on Monday night. Last comparable natural event was in 1882! http://www.driversofchange.com/ Anyone here familiar with Dowser? http://dowser.org/ A brutally honest little wake-up call. Is this group going through a process analogous to the Circle of the Heart Mushin Schilling documents here? 100 year event? 5.9 earthquake on Eastcoast was the strongest to strike Virginia since 1897 according to the USGS. Aftershocks are expected. 5.8 earthquake just hit Washington DC, New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Cleveland. More to follow. Are you in the region? Let us know... I am interested in hearing from group members who have been a part of the discussions in the field of Noetic Science the last ten years or so (anyone know Lynne McTaggard?) The phase transition I am interested in understanding, and why I prompted the phase transition discussion string, is the one happening in our individual and collective consciousness. Can we measure it? Can we track it? Can we show evidence of its arrival and likely outcome? just found this via Jason Silva - "Autocatalysis – Early life had to be an autocatalytic set. A series of chemical compounds in which molecule A catalyzed B, and B catalyzed C, and so on… until eventually Y catalyzed Z, that in turn catalyzed A, in a complete circle. Suddenly the self-perpetuating loop snaps into place. Suddenly, the loop creates itself. Suddenly something new is in the world. This strange loop is present wherever and whenever we find new levels of being. " Insightful, interesting, and realistic look at how we can build a new economy by The Next Edge's own Flemming Funch on Quora. Let us not be fooled: For all the calm in the markets what's going on with Bank of America could well spill into a Lehman or AIG type event? How can we truly influence others? Setting an example is not the main means of influencing others; it is the only means! -- Albert Einstein Proposed by Olivier Schulbaum and the Platoniq group: Recently endorsed by George Monbiot in the Guardian as 'plan B': I am currently thinking about invitations to http://www.gsbs2011.com/ and http://www.planetworkshops.org/en/index.html - will anyone from this group be attending either of these, or any other European sustainability events this Fall? Just learned about Margaret Wheatley's most recent work. Made me wonder what a collective book about all the participants of The Next Edge would look like--curated stories, quotes, life lesson? i know this is a little mundane, but can you all advise the best project management system for our new startup, green breakfast club? i love better means as a general collab tool, but need a robust project management tool. i have used basecamp, zoho, cohuman and many others - can you all kindly weigh on the best option, if basecamp is worth the price now or if there is a better, free alternative? thanks sooo much for your two cents on this... I am meeting with the curator of this site tomorrow. Interesting work.. he is trying to create a Continuum Development Index (CDI) to replace the current GDP - love any insights from those in the group that are tracking this terrain? In response to John Furey's question...

My formal graduate training focused on phase transitions in nonlinear systems.  So I've got expertise on this topic.  Is it worth exploring a focused discussion about phase transitions in social systems?  Would others in this list be interested?  It's an area I know quite a lot about. This is a very courageous piece by Samantha Miller. Most of us here are more focused on building "what's next" than on trying to fight against "what is" - but both efforts are important. Here is a woman with the courage to say something that lots of people are going to find irritating and disrespectful. It needs to be said, however.

Sometimes I too wonder whether the force of social change - at least in the U.S. - has been "captured" or institutionalized to such a degree that it is afraid of its own shadow. That is to say, that the institutions of social change have become so focused on financial and organizational stability that they have lost their punch. 

Is anybody else feeling the same way? I'd love to know what you all think about this... how can we use online gaming technologies and immersive reality approaches to shift the global power dynamics in the coming decades?

It's a thought stream I'm playing with right now. Welcome Brian Fey. Friends, Brian is one of those who actually took a big leap and went out and DID something - he founded Bosque Village, an ecological retreat / permaculture forest / intentional community. Here's what his bio says:  

"I live in a remote Mexican forest overlooking a lake with my friends.

I moved down from Seattle in 2004.

We spend a lot of time building, making art, trying to start businesses and hosting people from all over the world.
We welcome visitors who have similar ecological, cultural, or artistic goals.

We live a rustic life. No city water or power so we use rain catchment for water and have solar panels and satellite connection for internet." This is what I mean by "socially conscious enterprises."  Coke shoudl be creating jobs in Atlanta and everywhere there's a Coke bottling plant. If anyone will be at Burning Man this year I would love to have a gathering at Port11.org. We have a gathering of many social entrepreneurs there already. I am also doing a GER Talk at Ashram Galactica on Tuesday of Burn Week at 4:15. Topic: Creative Cities 

Suresh's post on open projects compelled me to share the new non-profit Burning Man Project with you all. It's being designed as a system for collaborative manifestation, though very young in the world. just found this blog post this weekend, seemed relevant to the group :) Bank of America has fallen to near its 52 week low today in NY. This is worth watching as it could possibly become a Lehman-type event? Any of you fine folks familiar with the old movie if H. G. Wells' story "Things to Come?" decades of endless war destroy knowledge & technology on both sides. One day an airplane is heard- unheard for years. Seems a band of people had gone off to preserve knowledge/tech. They come back to restore order and peace. I keep asking for Spielberg to remake it starring Tom Hanks.  Time to gather what Meg Wheatley has called "tellers of the New Story." We ARE the people we've been waiting for,  after all. Is it possible that Libyan rebels may be disunited? Vision without action is daydream. Action without vision is nightmare! Japanese Proverb How many of us are on Quora? Open forums with such frequent, surprisingly thoughtful discussions are few and far between. Here's an example. Why not help others and make their day? We can get everything in life we want, if we'll just help enough other people to get what they want! Full details of the NASA/DARPA 100 Year Startship Project symposium are now out. A lot of fascinating talk about "inventing the future" (not just science but sociology) will take place there...

http://www.100yss.org/pdf/100YSSAgenda_Aug162011.pdf Quick idea: Next Edge Crowd Fund: $10/mo each equals ~$50k/yr. We vote and fund one project each quarter. And of course shower it with the collective genius (scenius?) of the group. just had a fun afternoon hanging out in sonoma with Kathia Laszlo Alexander Laszlo Jeff Barnum Gail Taylor Marti Spiegelman Melissa Schwartz and Aftab Omer... - thanks for your wonderful hospitality Marti! http://futurepredictions.com/2011/01/24/3796-mega-list-of-future-predictions/ Good news! Oil prices should start falling if Libyan rebels succeed in toppling Gadhafi's regime, though full effect won't be felt for mths? thanks David Hodgson Hi everyone - Pls join me in welcoming Bob Stilger to our community.  Bob was the co-founder, with Meg Wheatley, of the @Berkana Institute and is currently helping Japan recover and re-build based on his resilient communities expertise.  You can read more on his blog at www.resilientjapan.org. He also teaches the Art of Hosting, Leadership, Systems and how/why to bike for miles and miles!  Bob, great to have you here! This kind of essay - by the highly respected and quoted Nouriel Roubini - is a heck of an opening for those of us who know a new, redesigned form of Capitalism needs to replace the current, obsolete version... What should we do with the various Tracks that are emerging? Since there are no real leaders (and some of us find 'leadership' in this context troubling), a simple way to move this forward would be to set up an Open Research Process on a Next Edge Wiki with the Tracks representing the initial pages. People could then add info and modify the wiki as they see fit. I don't think we need to look much further than this... Dinesh Tantri is this something you might want to take on further to your musings about how to effectively use wiki's in this context? Hi, and cheers to the group. Feeling greeted by the welcome and rules and being known outside of facebook as CoCreatr, let me share a first impression of the rules. At the edge there is supposed to be creative chaos. So for the Next Edge we follow Next Rules and embrace the Next Chaos.  Yes, no, maybe, or any value in between? I'm re-reading Gatto's teacher of the year acceptance speech - http://www.home-ed.vic.edu.au/2002/02/26/john-gatto-teacher-of-the-year-acceptance-speech/and found few items that may be of interest to the Next Edu track - Gatto says : "*The children I teach have a poor sense of the future, of how tomorrow is inextricably linked to today. As I said before, they have a continuous present, the exact moment they are at is the boundary of their consciousness.
*The children I teach are ahistorical, they have no sense of how past has predestined their own present, limiting their choices, shaping their values and lives.
*The children I teach are cruel to each other, they lack compassion for misfortune, they laugh at weakness, they have contempt for people whose need for help shows too plainly.                                                            *The children I teach are materialistic, following the lead of school teachers who materialistically “grade” everything — and television mentors who offer everything in the world for free.
*The children I teach are dependent, passive, and timid in the presence of new challenges. This is frequently masked by surface bravado, or by anger or aggressiveness but underneath is a vacuum without fortitude." Some of his worries around children having a poor sense of the future, being ahistorical and materialistic seems to be the mushy interface between Next Edge thinking and Next Edu - What do you think are the best ways to trickle some of the thinking happening in this group to kids? I think this interface can generate a creative collision of ideas. Sustainable energy technology just past the edge? I'd buy one. So much for offline action. 'Can China Save The World?' is our next briefing. Despite the $3 trillion cash pile all the evidence points to the contrary! Advance copy? howdy everybody

indeed we have an open source social networking platform - called PeopleAggregator - ready for any of you to:
- download
- set it up, configure
- propagate with those human things
- and get all social and such

:-)

Its on GitHub - ready to go Yes, it is an excellent piece of work -- gives of view of seven different communities. For those of you tracking Paul Gilding's The Great Disruption, I believe Derrick Jensen's Endgame a great compliment. Both support our ability to change trajectory and truly re-write history. Regardless of your beliefs remember survival has always been about adaptability. These resources support great mental challenges to support our conditioning and adaptability. I recently showed David Hodgson and Jessica Margolin our video of the Deliberative Corporation based on Deliberative Polling & Reframe It and it came out very well-- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiCB0iI37U0  --it shows how a deliberative process can be used to get the informed consent of a population and can create political capital for corporate or political leaders to make the right decision.  It was created for the reinventing management competition I mentioned to yall last week (we are seeking constructive comments there for two more weeks, please feel free to share on of yours there at http://www.managementexchange.com/hack/deliberative-corporation) Terri: here is a lot of work going on in this area, some of it supported at very high levels left and right and both. The Nation May 2100 had two articles by Martha C. Nussbaum, and Eyal Press. Press' article is titled "Beyond GNP" and Nussabaum's "What makes life good" reviews the Steiglitz, Sen , Fatoussi report "Mismeasuring our lives: Why GDP doesn't add up." Also check our Nussbaum and Sen's Capabilities work and the Subjective Wellbeing research, and check out the website afternow.com. -these are all attempts in this direction. None is perfect. I am working with a group in the UK and Finland looking for a more holistic index and includes a transformative dimension indicators.   The Eyal Press article in the Nation gives a pretty good overview as to why these initiatives usually end up on sone department's shelf.  A grass roots effort might have better luck. I would love to know what yur colleague is up to. plenty of space for real innovation here. I wonder if anyone knows any online platform specialized on the collaboration between corporations & social enterprises & NGOs ? (or governments and citizens). (What I have done myself over the last years, however without online platform) Thanks Venessa Miemis for introducing this resource on Worker Owned Co-Ops... It would be good to also start developing a Track and associated resource on governance models - http://www.geo.coop/node/627 look how these indigenous communities do it right with less complication.  http://permaculture-media-download.blogspot.com/2011/08/indigenous-community-resilience-short.html Anyone not following the Next Edge Diigo group is missing out on some excellent curation. In particular, Daniel Durrant has been resurfacing some foundational discussions that show the evolving history of this group that would be valuable for anyone to revisit or read for the first time. The inventor of Gmail & Friendfeed on self-definition. i had a very interesting meeting this morning with Cesar Castro, CEO of Discovery Cast, an innovation platform - it could be interesting to have the Next Edge plug into this platform ... The Campaign for Commons Literacy needs your help!

Commons and commoning provide an integrative framework for the profound social and civilizational transformation ahead of us. If you are not familiar with those distinctions, here’s a “nano-primer”:

“The Commons is the social and political space where things get done and where people have a sense of belonging and have an element of control over their lives, providing sustenance, security and independence. Commons are organised around resources that are collectively owned or shared between or among populations. It gives voice to civil society and helps us to learn new social practices, imagine a political, economic and social system beyond capitalism or communism. It is beyond party politics or other sectarian beliefs and practices.” (Wikipedia)

We, at the London-based School of Commoning, launched a crowdfunding Campaign for Commons Literacy, to realize the potential of the Commons in the UK. We have a specific project plan outlined on the Campaign’s site. Please visit it at http://www.indiegogo.com/CommonsCampaign and if what you read there resonates, make a contribution. Even small donations help. So does if you would blog or tweet about our initiative, like our Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/SchoolOfCommoning and spread the word about it in your networks.

The School is also open to collaborate and partner with like-hearted individuals and groups on projects that strengthen the commons everywhere. I hope to connect with you and explore how we can support each other.

george Excellent sounding new documentary. Does anyone know Hillman Curtis and/or Stefan Sagmeister?

This is their first case study: http://nexus.som.yale.edu/design-selco/ When Ideas Become Powerful - Seth Godin

http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/08/when-ideas-become-powerfu.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Fsethsmainblog+%28Seth%27s+Blog%29 jumping in here: Lately my primary edge thinking I am engaged in is in relation to "1493" and the dramatic effects of the "Columbian Exchange". Here in far Northern California the commonly held mythos of scattered bands of indigenous people living off of the meager holding capacity of the mythic untouched pristine wilderness remains.

Being also adopted Yurok and part of a tribe of dance makers I have held a contrary view that the Yurok and others shaped the landscape through fire and other methods and practiced a form of agriculture that was so effective as to almost be unseen by first contact. The practice of burning has even been restored over the last twenty years to the local woodlands areas including the avenue of the giants near my house.

Mann suggests in his book that there may have been vastly many more Indians inhabiting the land which they shaped anthropogenically into a basically sustainable form.

This has turned my head around: what if we have vastly underestimated the carrying capacity of the land here in California? Small Pox could have so dramatically altered the landscape a hundred years before we even got here that we may only have meagre ideas of how people lived previously and what their methods and intentions were for the land.

Somehow this idea gives me a curious stubborn hope. The Yurok are infamously network oriented so much so that they had to struggle to be recognized as a tribe and are considered :matriarchal" (not really correct just non-hierarchical).

It just seems more within reach to shape the land for diversity, resource replenishment and foodshed maintenance in light of some of these ideas. As soon as I started poking around the group I wondered what you would think of this shift in my thinking. The absurdity of our system. There are solutions.

Why do we not levy a tax (The Arms & Legs Tax) on all arms manufacturers that pays for the lost arms (and legs and lives) of our returning heros? How can any American, in good conscience, receive a dividend from a company that makes things that are designed to kill and maim, when there are young soldiers who return home hopelessly broken having paid an awful price for the protection of this profit?

The apportionment of cost on those who's profits come from any form of destruction, human or environmental, should be a basic principle of modern Civilization. Stumbled upon this interesting piece here - http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201108/is-real-educational-reform-possible-if-so-how :"evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, uses the phrase "You can't get there from here" to refer to a basic principle of evolution that applies to cultural evolution as well as biological evolution.  Organisms, whether they are biological organisms like dinosaurs or cultural organisms like our compulsory schooling system, are capable of gradual evolutionary change, but they are not infinitely capable of such change.  Sometimes you just can't get there from here.  The existing structure is built in such a way that it cannot be modified in ways necessary to produce a desirable, adaptive outcome.  Dinosaurs reached a point where they couldn't change to meet the new conditions of life, so they died out and their niches were replenished with new, highly adaptable little creatures called mammals.  Our system of compulsory schooling--which arose originally for purposes of indoctrination and obedience training (see A Brief History of Education)--cannot be modified to serve effectively the function of real education."  Does anyone else have anecdotal evidence from other areas for the ""You can't get there from here" pattern ? I would be interested in a visual map of where we are all located. I wonder how many UN countries are represented in NextEdge. Might we consider our #practice of finding ways to create value among our diverse talents & perspectives at the micro-level to be a test case for the possibility of it thriving in the macro? #justsayin As Curtis Faith pointed to http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2010/12/the-big-shift-challenge-and-opportunity-for-women.html... where John writes eloquently from a position I strongly share with him, I want to point out the masculine and feminine presence here. And the men and women... balance? In right relation? What containers or behaviors might open space for masculine conversations? What containers or behaviors might open space for feminine conversations? And what will invite more women to shift from lurking to speaking? Those of you interested in concrete projects, if in Europe coordinate through the Blue Economy Design Center. Those in the US - we have a solid group trained over the years but rather dispersed in location and content. If in Japan, India, South Africa or Latin America, we have operational teams in many locations. Thank you. Have a look at the video on The Blue Economy at YouTube first to explain the basics with three cases and then the one applied to Germany where we contributed to the exit of nuclear power by 2022 moving the argument away from "for or against" to "what is better and cheaper". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1af08PSlaIs and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLNuF0CoYO4
Let us make more projects happen on the ground. Based on those concepts (and others) Masayoshi Son founder of Softbank and Yahoo Japan is spearheading innovations in Japan. With Germany and Japan on track - and thousands of initiatives at small scale we can turn this around and generate the jobs. What are the stages in the evolution of an Open Project? One thing that it would be prudent to do is to aware, at a meta level, of the dynamics of this group and to see if we can identify stages of evolution... My experience in newly formed open spaces is that stage 1 consists of lots of energy and dialogue as people attempt to connect with each other, process new ideas, identify kindred spirits and so on... At some point it becomes clearer to whom you are more closely aligned. This is natural. This results in sub-groups and side projects and so on. Is there a next stage? Should this be something that we form intentions about? What is the relationship between said intentions (or their absence) and the nature of how things will emerge?.... wish I had some clarity ;-) An thought experiment? Or a really dumb idea. Assume we are playing and not serious. Could we arrive at a party platform? Let's pretend we are a political party. Please assume I am NOT serious about becoming a party. I see this as different from other ways of framing it...because of course being a party means a decided need to get elected. Could we come up with a 20 plank platform that had any hope of getting us into office? (Again this is a GAME) Minor Memetic Project: Spreading the Genuine Progress Indicator or Genuine Wealth (Econ of Happiness) idea - in contrast to GDP. Do you propagate these ideas in your circles or perhaps other new national metrics schemas? I've seen references to "The Next Edge group on Facebook" elsewhere. So the knowledge of this group's existence is leaking out. Don't know whether that's a good or bad thing, but it might cause problems of perceived exclusion. What do you think we should do about that? so maybe another way to view this, is as The Next Edge think tank. we are a collective intelligence Is it theoretically possible to live in a world where we all have the same amount of power? I ask this without qualification, so please feel free to qualify! i was wondering whether people in this group have changed behavior in response to information such as this? Is human consciousness capable of sufficient embodied understanding of the collective situation we are facing?  

"Currently, the Ocean is in a critical state of health. If it continues to decline, it will reach a point where it can no longer function effectively and our planet will be unable to sustain the ecosystems that support humankind." How do you know when you've made a difference? i think we hit some kind of inflection point in group interactivity today - so i'd just like to remind folks that they can stop group email, if they so wish, by clicking the 'edit settings' button at the top of the page :) Where "green" technology was expensive, the next edge - blue economy - is profitable. What makes you want to be the First Follower in someone else's project? There is some sense in which, if the objective is to develop an infrastructure that would make it possible for millions of people to connect and coordinate activity, two problems need to be solved... 1) Project Matching (identification): we need to be able to find each other... 2) Open Project Infrastructure: the infrastructure that enables us to work together after we find each other. The latter is what I just posted. The former was something that I worked in with Timothy Rayner and the Coalition of the Willing project a few months ago. Within that context and with the help of others, we used the 'dating site' analogy to outline some ideas as to how this matching process might work. These ideas were captured in the following presentation...http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/pro-m-draftreview0308111 Jennifer asked me to help set up a goole map for the group - here it is - Just add a pin for you The Dow is down again. Emotional responses? Good? Bad? 
Personally, I get a little giddy waiting for the shift and wanting it to be sudden and irreversible so we can get moving on rolling out the new economy at scale. A dragged out collapse seems like it will result in more suffering during the slide. Thriving is more likely when we clear the debris. Foresight question - Who can you recommend as the best political analyst of Europe?  Want to update my models on how the political situation in Europe will evolve, particularly the EU.  Will Germany accept a Eurobond?  Will Greece exit?  etc. Perhaps some members of this list would like to help make this project a success?  I'm doing a crowdfunding campaign to create a Design Manual for Large-Scale Change... Smart Dust Surveillance - Is it possible to settle ethical issues using foresight? I would love to see this group help evolve and innovate this platform: americanselect.org the questions are very lame - but the developers are open to hear what folks have to say. I assume you will have many of the same problems I do with the questions. So perhaps you would be willing to provide input for the beta of a promising platform.... Do you really know what you are after? Many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after! - Thoreau Isn't it just ONE Being? We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience! - Chardin Gibran on organisms and ecosystems and the need for an ecosystem for movement: http://interactioninstitute.org/blog/2011/08/16/an-ecosystem-for-movement/ Let's see if we might fight. Monogamy, Polygamy, Polyandry - Discuss. Anyone want to throw down on this?  I've been approached on a number of fronts to participate. Shereef Bishay just open sourced hgi democratic project management platform @Bettermeans.  I'd be interested in joining a deployment for NextEdgers and see if that toolset can help us organize, create action items and move forward. The Next Edge moves way faster than I can track it. Allen Butcher is a really interesting scholar on communal economics, see also http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Community_Economics I don't know why but when I saw Peter Fechter's photos [ 29 and 30 ] here - http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/08/remembering_the_divide.html  - I felt an irresistible urge to see Carl Sagan's "Pale Blue Dot" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g - Timeless ! So relevant to many discussions we are having here. Handy reference for non-historians amongst us who anyway need to understand history - Timeline of systematic data and computable knowledge from Wolfram Alpha - http://www.wolframalpha.com /docs/timeline/ Facebook map by way of comparison. Only 330 members in this, but a quite different picture. What was interesting was watching the FB map grow over the first two months (we know have an animation of this). How information moves between minds. Fascinating. For those of you who have no idea what the heck we're on about here. Take a look at this. Where are you in this world of thought? Kevin Clark asked, "What do people on The Next Edge think the phrase “…the new economy…” means?"

My understanding of the economic transition we're going through is largely captured in Arthur Brock's now-classic Prezi. Take the time to watch it if you haven't already. Highly recommended. Big aside - I'm creating a gifted and talented program for my kid's elementary school.  Anyone with special sauce, please contact me. Why does it feel so? This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning! - Churchill The full program for the Democracy Convention I'm attending next week in Madison WI has been posted.  l welcome any comments / suggestions you might care to offer for how this effort to counter the rise of the Tea Party in America might succeed...

http://democracyconvention.org/expanded_view_full_program Thank you David Hodgson and Jean Russell for nudging me to pay attention here. Some of what I have been reading in this group has inspired me to write this recent post at the Evolutionize It blog. Please feel free to comment/share as you feel moved to do so. The crowd here in New Mexico are cheering for the appearance of Maturana in our midst...Carry on Alive Being largely out of the news stream this month - in India where my limited internet time is devoted to important things (like trying to catch up here!), I'm wondering about a different question.

Are we seeing the death of some long-held illusions:
     * Market crash: that the stock markets have any relationship to reality, rather than a collective gambling. 
     * London riots: that growth will benefit the poor as well as the rich if they are patient long enough
     * Middle East: that nothing can be done about undemocratic governments
     * Washington: that the US has a government capable of running a country. 

I'm sure you could pick your own crisis/myth pairs (Global Financial Crash; Spain/Italy; etc) 

I'm interested in three things around this
1: what other myths are going to shatter in the next year or so
2: will there be a synergistic effect e.g. Middle East, then Spain/italy crash leads to middle-east style revolution in Spain?  
3: if old myths are disappearing, what new myths/realities will take their place, and by who (war against terror / Tea party etc).

and most importantly….

What new story (true or false) would it be good to see adopted, and how might that story gain widespread belief. Curtis Faith, great articles on human flourishing (in the John Hagel welcome thread)!

I think there's a way we can start overturning the scarcity-driven, win/lose premises of present economies.

Next Edge, P2P Foundation, and kindred tribes, for example, can create potentially transformative bundles of digital opportunities of value for communities now suffering from scarcities.

MicroSD cards for cell phones can hold a wealth of eLearning, eHealthcare, microgrants, eGov innovations, telework microtasks, and alternatives for dispute resolution.

These resources could be shared with local allies to help in spreading digital abundance. As they shared local successes via Flickr and Youtube, increasing levels of digital giving could go to vanguard communities.

Such an approach would help grassroots P2P initiatives achieve early wins in skills formation and job opportunities for the new era, and encourage other communities to jump in too.

What do you think? Anne Caspari is now my closest thought companion now. The map groweth, the shape of thoughts changeth not allot. I'll post the map of Facebook (330 people so far). See next post. Given the latest market crash, what are the plunging bond yields - including 10 year US Treasuries going below 2% - telling us..? Recession? I developed this graphic in 1996. Now seems like an appropriate time to introduce it to this group.  A HUGE opportunity exists is we add global collaboration into the active conversations going on here (most of which seem to me to be about process). Please welcome John Hagel - a passionate lover of the edge, a collector of edge-riders, and a deeply playful soul. I like this flyer. You can print out the PDF and pin hardcopies anywhere you like.

will have noticed the bias in the group as mapped so far. This picture might change dramatically if more of us were mapped. Or, it might not. Either way, there is a lot this map can potentially reveal about the workings of this group and how we might move towards achieving any objectives. Including how this group might create an impact on people outside of this group with all of the wonderful discussion and insight it is engaged in. Care to share how you see the world and contribute?

And I wondered if anyone else grew up with a commons? By which I mean: my family had about 100 acres. We sold 3 acre lots other people, and buying a "lot" gave you access to use the shared 60 "commons" together. I have never found people of a tribe that thought that this was normal/shared this experience. I would like to. Who's friends with John Hagel? I think he would be good to have here.

We evolved with them in a symbiotic relationship, which raises the question of just who is occupying whom.

“We are massively outnumbered,” said Jeremy K. Nicholson, chairman of biological chemistry and head of the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London. Altogether, he said, 99 percent of the functional genes in the body are microbial. " http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/health/16cancer.html?hpw 

I know that I've spoken of an individual person as figuratively a city of multiple people, but now it appears that this is true in a much more literal sense than I imagined. Human beings it seems are made up of multiple forms of life of which the DNA, our part that we thought of as the thing that made us unique in popular culture and science-- if all pf that which made us unique is really only  1 percent of what we are, then we have some dark matter of human life's multi-species co-dependence that is humanity if this is what it appears to reveal. Could become a fascinating rewriting of the meta-story of human evolution. How sholud this change our narrative? Was this the original relationship economy Jerry Michalski? True? All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark!

What I said on August 5 in Europe throws in the towel will become accepted reality in a manner of weeks. Europe will -have to- admit that it can't save a country the size of Italy, at least not one with debts the size of Italy's. 

What happens after that is, for now, anybody's guess. We can be sure that there are contingency plans being set up, and likely even discussed at today's meeting, but it doesn't look at all like Berlin and Paris have any more grip on the issues than anyone else has. 

Germany and Holland may decide to leave the EU, but that would leave France in a type of isolation that Sarkozy deems unacceptable. Greece, Ireland and Portugal could be thrown out, but that wouldn't solve the Italian and Spanish problems. They could aim for a two-tier Euro system, with "northern" euros more highly valued than "southern" ones, but that would still leave France very unhappily hanging by its fingernails. So http://TheFutureWeDeserve.com is my in-over-my-head nightmare project. It was such a simple idea: 100 essays about the future from 100 people, 500 words ea, a nice simple Wikibook. 

I was so naive. What came back were a bit over a hundred "Future Haikus" of which probably *60* or *80* took my model of the future, and broke it. By the time I was done, my strong, sophisticated futurist's understanding of the future was gone, and I was left with no idea what was going to come next.

I was supposed to be writing a big long introduction, copy-editing and putting together the book, and instead I've been staring at the pieces trying to come to terms with how little I know, and how much insight people have into the places where the future touches their lives.

Does that answer your question, Phil? Does it? <grin> an interest piece from Geof Cox at the RSA. "if they had access to the right support about one in three people would like to be social entrepreneurs" cc Kevin Jones .. sorry about my last update- put it in here inadvertently  - my bad! "The Elusive Big Idea" is a big idea itself: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-elusive-big-idea.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&emc=eta1 “Come to the edge, he said. They said: We are afraid. Come to the edge, he said. They came. He pushed them and they flew.” ~ Guillaume Apollinaire
It has inspired me for many years now. That and "Go out on a limb. That is where the fruit is" (which gets attributed to lots of people). "The Elusive Big Idea" from the NYT Sunday Review is a big idea itself; I commend it and offer it as my first posting gift to The Next Edge virtual gathering: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-elusive-big-idea.html?pagewanted=3&_r=2&emc=eta1 How do we think about the values that define the New Paradigm... here are a few thoughts...http://www.facebook.com/notes/suresh-fernando/the-path-of-the-sacred-heart-values-for-a-new-cultural-paradigm/10150183399842168 I wrote one of the most intense essays I've ever created this morning. It's amazing how much more willing people are to engage with ideas about radical change than they were two months ago... Are we the ONE we have been waiting for? What if we have no ONE to blame or to complain about? If we are all ONE, isn't separation illusion? I was so honored to be invited by David Hodgson here at NextEdge. Honestly my first response was one of pride. Yes, sorry to admit but the acknowledgement felt wonderful. However, now that I am here and really understand a bit more about being here, I was stuck by Seb Paquet use of the term "Edgelet" yesterday in a post. It reminded me of an a baby bird perhaps even a baby eagle. I was then overhwelmed with the image of a young bird being pushed out of the next and the beautiful metaphor of bravery & courage that "new flight" requires. I am not longer in pride, I am clearly in the air with all of you in hopes that my wings will open and that where I land is a better place. Truly humbled. Who uses Del.icio.us? Would it be worthwhile using the networks function there to set up a shared bookmarking service for us?

I am hoping that you might be able to help us. We need examples of large scale industry change--how our collective efforts have changed business practices tangibly? Not case studies, but the metrics of change, at the national and international levels. Hoping for LOTS of examples! Curious if this group is aware of Innocentive.

Why it matters:  http://reason.com/archives/2007/08/03/our-intangible-riches What is unity consciousness? Oneness is not an attribute of ourselves as individuals. Oneness is our relationships to others and the Divine! In awe of the talent in this space:
Great souls are not those who have fewer passions and more virtues than others, but only those who have greater designs. 
Francois de La Rochefoucauld All good stuff.  Confucian/Taoist atlas?  Yes, I think its a discipline and a practice. As I understand it--which I confess is far too little indeed--western rationalist/scientist that I am--this cannot be objectified but can be encountered through the consciousness practices derived from from the wu wei way of experiencing Being. That would include any of the taoist consciousness arts.  

Lucie: Yes open heart. Especially when lost, I think. 
Elva: Yes, "a person, team, group, or whole system is being pulled from the future. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called this The Omega Point". 
My beloved friend and teacher Carl Rogers who spent time in China in the 1920s, was much influenced by Kurt Goldstein and more importanly spent countless hours in empathic relationships with others,  concieved of an actualizing tendency in the universe that we can attune to and align with. That is how I think of human processes. Can't prove it but I do sense it, so I guess this is my 'faith.'  
Elva: Yes.  I think (as I think you are saying) the universe may be experienced by us but doubt it will be "understood" in the sense that the Western Enlightenment project imagined. But experience can sometimes be a more reliable starting point for creative next steps. Hi folks! Just added to the group, I guess Venessa thought the http://ResilienceDesigner.com site I just put up was relevant to the scene here. Hello, all :-) V> (aka "hexayurt guy") Curtis: I appreciate this you bringing into the conversation the epistemic differences encountered in your Twitter exchange with Vinay.   Let me add a couple of other elements to the thread. The idea of a "living map of the territory which stands between where we are and where we hope to get" is an instrumentalist and Western frame.   Nothing wrong with that, but it is not a universal fame. The notion of change as linear—from unacceptable “here” to and already chosen more desirable  “there” is embedded in the Western  metaphysics of causality inherited via the Greeks.  This is different from the Confucian/Taoist  metaphysics that considers causality to be an  emergent property of pre-existing essential or virtual forms The idea of a "map" presupposes the territory is knowable—perhaps reflecting a faith in our capacity to know and to control. But as the future remains open and therefore unknowable.  In unknown territory one needs a compass--some lodestone attuned to the deeper essence of the emerging flow--wu wei in resonance with te--the point of discovery of “this place” before we are moved to take the next step to the “next place”. As Don Michael says in "In Search of a Missing Elephant" we are unavoidably blind, confronted with the never-before emergent patterns. This means I think that  we certainly need scout and followers, and we need  prophets, risk takers, consolidators, preservationists, innovators,  followers, healers, and criticizers.  But above all, we need humility in any of these roles and be willing to be learners who will to tune into and align ourselves to what is becoming necessary. Is It 1937 All Over Again?

A horse doesn't care how much you know, until he knows how much you care! - Pat Parelli I was struck by this article in the Guardian today. It would seem like one of the greatest sources of opportunity to make a major difference in development to support preservation while that is still a possibility in Yasuni: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/14/ecuador-oil-yasuni-national-park "Five years ago the state oil company Petroecuador found a massive new oil field containing nearly a billion barrels of oil in Block 31 of the Yasuní national park close to the Brazilian border. The find was equivalent to 20% of all the nation's reserves, worth a minimum $7-10bn.

The dilemma is that the oil in the Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini (ITT) field is below one of the most biodiverse areas of the world and to extract it would devastate one of the last great wildernesses...Because of its location right on the equator at the junction of the forest and the mountains, Yasuní is one of the last places on earth which is truly undisturbed. As well being home to the the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, two of the world's last uncontacted tribes, the park is thought to have more species of plants, animals and insects per hectare than anywhere else on earth.

One six-square-kilometre patch of Yasuní – chosen by scientists almost at random – was found to have 47 amphibian and reptile species, 550 bird and 200 mammal species living there. Another patch of land in the park breaks all the world records for bats and insects. More tree species grow in a single hectare of rainforest in Yasuní than in all of north America. A single hectare of rainforest there may contain as many as 100,000 insect species and most of the 2,000 species of fish known to live in the rivers of the Amazon region are believed to be there.

There have been more species of frogs and toads recorded in the park than are native to the United States and Canada combined; more insect species have been found living on one tree than in all of the United States; more birds seen there than in all Europe....Ecuador: four months to save the world's last great wilderness from 'oil curse'

When large reserves of oil were discovered under Yasuní national park, Ecuador offered the world a choice: give us money and we will not allow drilling. Now $60m must be found by December How about we create a Next Edge group in GoodReads? We could all see what the must-read books are in this tribe. My background includes 25 years in the regulation and development of markets and enterprises, and related instruments – much at the highest level.

Here in Scotland where I am now based, we have – uniquely, I believe – three verdicts in a criminal trial.  The conventional black and white absolutes of Guilty and Not Guilty; and the indeterminate (quantum?) verdict of 'Not Proven'.

For the last few hundred years we have gone down a legal and financial path based upon  Newtonian subject/object absolute conflicting legal claims of infinite (divine right of capital) ownership and temporary (finite) use.  But there is in fact a synthesis, which is indeterminate use, or use for an indefinite period, and this I have come to think of as 'Open' Capital, as distinct from the existing closed and conflicting forms which are engrained in our consciousness.

We have come to think of Property and Money as objects, when in fact they are the relationship between the subject (individual) owner/user and the object (that which is owned/used).

I believe that there is an emerging generation of simple consensual and associative agreements which will enable us to refine the property and money relationships. I see no future for institutions as Organisations, but rather I see institutions as associative agreements as farmeworks for self organisation to a common purpose.

Moreover, I believe that we have now reached the point where simple but radical instruments have become the 'adjacent possible' as the process of 'napsterisation' extends from where it began in the music industry to embrace all other fields of human endeavour.

Interestingly, my experience is that the US combines both the greatest mental rigidity in resisting understanding of this emerging paradigm, with the greatest potential for good once the paradigm shift to a networked, decentralised, dis-intermediated, adaptive and above all Reslient society takes place.

Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality is key: or Metaphysics of Value in the economic space, where I view Economics as the Physics of Value.

Quality and Value are two aspects of the same Reality, and are both definable only in relative terms: as J A Wheeler put it:  'Reality is defined by the questions you put to it”.

I believe we are currently experiencing the turbulence to be expected during any Phase Transition: but even this time next year, I hoep and expect, the world will look very different, and in a magnificently positive way. I noticed one thing with "The Next Edge FB" Its might be close to become a self learning platform - Emergence (at least soem properties are there to se)!

New Buckminster Fuller "one man show" DVD I just found out about...

https://www.createspace.com/308142 i was interviewed for an anarchist, collapse is imminent permaculture kind of usually psychedellic podcast today. kmo. we were both surprised at our overlaps and how much sense we made to each other. biodiversity, agroecology, linked to a new way of thinking about value. he asked how he would explain me to his marxist friend who thinks markets are evil. i said i don't spend much time trying to explain myself to fundamentalists; they'e got their minds made up. What conversations must we have, to (re)build government that works well? Government that not only achieves the needs and wants of its citizens, but strives to do so in the most time- and cost-effective ways, while also making its customers, and employees more satisfied. How can already-strained government employees and leaders find the time to come together, listen, try, and learn? How can they do anything other than investing in their own better outcomes - for all of us?  This is the core of my work, and I need your help. There is a community of futurist and foresight folks – Shaping Tomorrow - I would like to have Bruce Lloyd to be here, since he has broad insights in future trends. Opinions? Suggestion - Create an "Info" or Welcome page that let's folks know what this is all about? i just switched on twitter and found this quote from Dorai about the shift from connected to hyperconnected - while i was taking a break from writing a blog about an emerging macro shift towards hypersociality. This is an example of the flow i think many of us find ourselves immersed in when online. We are points of curatorial synthesis immersed in the evolving flow of consciousness. Part of a social, group flow... flow at the level of emergent community which is, i think, a description of scenius - scenius emerges from creative hypersociality The next edge is the first edge: basic human survival. All of our technologies, new paradigms, theories, etc. are missing the component related to how they will help people meet food, energy, fabrication and access needs without existing 20th century industrial era infrastructure. We are rapidly approaching the time where it will become obvious as to what is useful towards the new survival ends however. i know there are several musicians and people who love music in the group - i play ukelele, guitar, percussion, piano, electronic stuff - and anything else i can make some kind of noise out of that happens to be laying around.. i would really like to know what we love listening to - setting up a social radio station using turntable.fm, or something, might be fun.. as well as revisiting the idea from much earlier about setting up a way to co-curate videos.. this is a very interesting video - this rioting in the uk sounds like working class youth nihilism - a violent eruption of the cultural shadow of british society One of the thoughts that keeps popping up is the idea of what we would do, both collectively, and individually if resources and interoperability with existing systems were not a constraint.

Let's just take a simple example from the tech space. Mesh wireless internet, such as we might want to deploy in countries without any existing infrastructure, or when a disaster takes down existing infrastructure.

At any given point in time, there are only two or three ways of doing this that make sense. If we put all of our respective wants into a basket we might get it down to a set of criteria:

1) Inexpensive
2) Easy to support
3) Resilient
4) Open Source
5) Expandable
6) Modular
7) High-bandwidth
8) Energy efficient

Now, there are many people, and some in this group, who are working on or with groups implementing these technologies.

I suspect that each of the groups are operating under some set of suboptimal constraints because of resource restrictions, not enough money or access to equipment, not enough political connections, limited understanding of the entire system, etc. And people want to get things done, so they're going to do it in anyway they can see a clear path from problem to solution. They will conceive of their constraints as the reality within which they need to operate to be successful. People who get things done don't fight big fights unless they need to. They go around obstacles or over them, they don't have time to remove them.

Well, what if we could step back and say: how would we design a system for African villages, from scratch, assuming we had control of all the variables. What would that look like? In other words, what would the clean-slate world look like?

It is likely that it would be different in some ways from what people are considering because of the current very real existence of those obstacles.

It seems to me, that with our collective talents and resources, we could help make it possible for clearly superior ideas to get traction and the resources necessary for their implementation and rollout. Perhaps we can clear some of the obstacles so the good people doing hard work don't have to work around them so much.

This concept applies more broadly to many types of projects, economics, sustainability, transportation, architecture, social structures, politics even.

So, perhaps we should start spelling out somewhere what we'd really like to see in the world, to give opportunity to the architects and designers and makers to deliver those things.

Does anyone else plan on posting their personal story here? I thought after the conference call, that we were going to work to connect at a heart level more.  But now, I can't even find where I posted my story. It seems to have fallen many levels down... which we all continue to post "head" rather than heart stuff.

How about it? Some potentially useful findings: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110725190044.htm You can find on P2P Foundation blog where I've discussed in the past that it may only take as much as 20% of population to adopt a way of thinking in order to see it cascade to the majority of the rest. I think we're seeing the possibility for this now with the commons, open source, and distributed p2p systems. Yet, we are also seeing the same phenomenon with the "Tea Party", racial tensions in Europe, and small minorities igniting anger and fear around the world. Results of being interviewed by William Shatner (For my fellow Star Trek fans)... we now have 3 interesting software platforms (that I know of) represented here on the next edge, that might be fun for us to play with as a collaborative.. Why fear problems? In a day, when you don't come across problems - you can be sure that you are travelling in a wrong path! Vivekananda just hanging out at the Hub with Katie Johnson and she wanted to ask the group - how is this emerging social economy impacting your life, and how do you envision it impacting your life in 5 years? Our group bookshelf has begun being filled with great books. Click the "view »" link to see what members think of each book. Everything is getting broken because almost nobody can figure out how to align self-interest with collective interest anymore. I wrote this a while back, and it may be of interest to people in this group: http://forwardfound.org/blog/?q=comparing-business-development-paradigms Sometimes a picture says it all.

There is something interesting, unique and exciting happening in this Next Edge Group... I truly believe that whatever it is, is providing us all with a sense of both what is possible as well as what is needed. That said, I can`t quite put my finger on what is unique about this environment... thoughts? Thrilled to see John Furey here. If you don't know him, he is doing some provacative work with the concept of Mindtime. His premise is that we are hardwired to a certain time orientation and that orientation impacts our world view and word choices http://www.mindtime.com/ I wonder what a macro-map of this group's collective mindtime orientation would look like? I suspect we could learn a lot for that exercize. Not an expectation, merely an invitation . . . Get to know John, he's pretty cool! This grant is restricted to the Commonwealth countries but it could be of interest to some of us who want to find easier ways of collaboration. 
I am particularly interested in working with people on self sufficient communities in India and would like to identify people who would like to collaborate on this. This grant could make the travel easier.

http://www.mindtimemaps.com/start/thenextedge Hello all Next Edge people.... would those that are in the UK and in London on August 30th please let me know here...I'd like to invite you to some drinks that we are arranging whilst David will be in the UK... thanks. Hello all!  I am helping to start a MFA in Design for Social Innovation in NY at the School of Visual Arts and I am on the hunt for the perfect 25 students for our inaugural class (they could be designers, business professionals, architects, engineer, technology fanatics)

 I would love to hear from this brilliant group where you think these people might be hiding and how I can reach them.  Thanks! I wonder if a well-organized open effort could win this. I'm off to a meeting at Oxford University with Human Futures Institute. Any comments, questions, thoughts welcome to take with me Hopeful thoughts on poverty and global human development from Vinay Gupta (@leashless on Twitter, is he part of this group?) from 2009.

It is precisely the kind of social-media enabled collaboration and collective intelligence possibilities Vinay outlines here that drives my personal quest. We can work together to build a better world. It is not that far off.

And the types of solutions we collectively build (with many, perhaps most of the creativity and ideas coming from the poor with limited resources), are also the types of tools and technologies we need to deal with State breakdown, peak oil, and environmental catastrophe. Any body going to the Creative Commons Global Summit? If so please teach us what we can learn for our GlobalNextEdgeEvent. Thank you all for a rich & robust week of learning & meeting amazing people. great coherence call this morning with Suresh Fernando Lauren Higgins Steve Brant Sean Culman Bruce Waltuck Kate Michi Ettinger Maureen Kelsey Jean Russell Alexander Laszlo Avary Kent Are crises opportunities?

I find it amazing how this group can constructively discuss challenging ideas with so little friction or resistance. David Hodgson mate, cannot tell you enough how grateful I am you've set up this Next Edge fb group. awesome space to continue the exploration and discovery that came with Gathering '11. thank you. :) BTW for anyone interested in coming to Melbourne (Australia) for Gathering '12, we're looking at holding it the last weekend in March and likely to expand in to a festival of events with the second weekend being the Easter long weekend. more details out in a few weeks. :) "Banish the word 'struggle' from your attitude and your vocabulary. All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration. We are the ones we have been waiting for." — Hopi elders This article seems right up our alley. The Age of Paradox by Charles Handy was a very relevant and interesting read for me some years ago. I keep thinking back to it and realizing more and more how 'au point' it really was/is. I've just returned from three weeks in Europe on business and visiting family and friends. London, Paris, Milan, Geneva and Belizona (Ticino, CH). It was a vivid first hand impression of the state of mind of Europe (at least an important part of it). The riots in London are significant in that they are showing a flash point (regardless of the original raison d'etre). As with the Arab Spring, fed mostly by the energy of disenfranchised and out of work youth, Europe is at a flash point of unrest in its youth (and therefore easily led). I was there (in London) during the riots of the late 70's and 80's. Strangely reminiscent, even to the very location it all started (and is now continuing-the poorest part). Financial desperation, anger at the wealthy and hopelessness for a fair future has been the spark that has ignited Europe's youth and populace throughout the ages. And, the results were revolutionary, literally.

Two questions: Is the USA facing a similar vent (given the new reality of a tarnished rating and its impacts, and a desperately poor economic outlook, at least for many millions)? What can we do - TODAY? Why is it that the frenzy in financial markets echoes in the frenzy on the streets, quickening momentum echoes in the pulse of the universe? i'll host another coherence call next wednesday morning (pacific), use G+ hangout, and try to record it! Why do we always need "The Next"? Why don't we simply get the current stuff right?
There is a lot to do RIGHT NOW - in order to get the NEXT right! Compulsive facebook posting / commenting?

Great 2.5 min video of John Jay (W+K) on creativity - listening, empathy, and honoring the uniqueness of each person's creative process. http://www.theinspiration.com/2011/08/john-jay-wk-on-creativity/ An idea: We've been estranged from the nature of true value for a long, long time. Many current trends seem to make people come in closer contact with what real value is. Down the line this will make it easier for everyone to produce it, recognize it and exchange it. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14472567 Wondering if others have thoughts on this, so I want it to kick off a new thread.

And my sense, having worked near philanthropy for 8 years, is that the digital divide is a significant issue. Older philanthropists are doing philanthropy as they have always done it...through their social network and via applications. And young leaders/innovators are online instead of pursuing the channels our predecessors did. So we aren't meeting up. I could be mistaken... Thoughts? Personal stories (phone call follow-up). Please post below. (I will start with mine.) i like the idea, the impulse and the initial format i like the idea, the impulse and the initial format Hat tip to Liz McLellan for this:  How many in this group are Star Trek fans? (My hand is way up!) This is interesting research. It makes the link between wealth and a very specific type of sociopathy that helps maintain that wealth. Are there paths to changing these attitudes among the wealthy? Or is wealth simply doomed to periodically overreach and overshoot, leading to corrective paths via other means (i.e. the kind of mass rioting we're seeing in the U.K. right now)? Folks this is the soft singularity we have spoken about – Jose would love this one.

This is happening well before 2020 – and already our everyday Nokia offers ‘augmented’ reality.  Don’t you love it augmented – as in improved increased and enlarged.  In many ways the Amish are right so were the Luddites in their social justice aspects.

Few folk give a stuff about this Tsunami though.  Thx for the air time Inara. Ciao paul I nominate this article (http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/the-harlem-project.html) as the best article on social innovations gathered into an operating system that has ever been written. Any other nominations? Jean Russell something wasn't working with my post to you under your question, so I am posting a response here regarding philanthropy. I really like the framework here Acting Bigger, Adapting Better in a Networked World. While this report is a bit dated-it is still robust &  relevant. Perhaps it may provide some clues to your questions. . . Here's to you and the Prime Directive Steve. I am thinking how appreciative I am to be born and “awake” at this particular moment in time.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss." 

I know everyone here in The Next Edge are learners.
Let’s really capture what is going on in this "spot of time" so we can articulate and learn these lessons for our children.

Remember the poignant movie The Red Violin? 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhqgV4flGdE
The violin took on the character and absorbed the personality of each of the owners across history. 

I think ideas are the same way. They don’t belong to any one of us in particular. If we are lucky an idea or inspiration may “land” on us and allow our articulation to introduce the concept to the world. But voicing the idea does not mean ownership. After all, ideas build based on all of our exposures, conversations, reading and listening. 

I think Virginia Woolf said it best:
Masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.

I am sure most, if not all of you, have also heard of Rupert Sheldrake and his term “morphic resonance.” We are all in the field of shared experiences and many of the concepts bounce from genius in the past to contemporary voices. Two or more in completely different communities will all of a sudden have the same “epiphany” due to a “cloud of wisdom.”

Morphic Resonace Wikipedia

In a “sharing economy” the hardest part is having trust that you will get the acknowledgement you need and most of all will not be left out as your ideas trade hands, improve and take on a life of their own. Like a child grows independently, so do ideas, and the same psychological individuation is required.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation

Perhaps this is why I think we need to continually  support, acknowledge and affirming one another. If more people feel “safer” in sharing their ideas I think we will get a lot more brilliance from everyone around us.

Cheers to our personal edges here at the precipice of The Next Edge,
Jennifer "As the experience of the 1930s testified, a prolonged global downturn can have profound political and geopolitical repercussions. In the U.S. and Europe, the downturn has already inspired unsavory, right-wing populist movements. It could also bring about trade wars and intense competition over natural resources, and the eventual breakdown of important institutions like European Union and the World Trade Organization. Even a shooting war is possible."

https://twitter.com/#!/gideonro/the-next-edge Can anyone help me figure out how in the world to keep up with this secret and wonderful group? To much juiciness to keep track of! Who knows Joe Edelman? He should be here. Anyone interested in digital epistemology (study of knowledge creation in the digital age)? That 'Brooms Up' pic is neat! I would love Ross to be a part of our community. Here are slides to his recent Gartner keynote. He is brilliant & generous.  The theme I like to dig into is the integration between business strategy & interpersonal awareness. I call it Strategy Leadership & Soul. Any resources & convos regarding these themes please send my way. Thank you. Jenn Got this via Steve Brant on Twitter. If this group were able to influence some of the content of this series, it could have tremendous impact on lots of people.... Do other folks have any issues with tons of expensive conferences and air travel? I have trouble justifying going to all of these events....There are so many! Beyond the Edge lies Possibility Space. The domain of knowns and unknowns, knowable and not. Where we recall the past, in the present, to act into the emergent future. We'll need the capacities of agility, adaptability, and resilience as we Explore, Try, Learn, and Achieve. 

We can make our way, thinking and doing, together.

How will we journey beyond the Edge? We've been developing our concepts for more than 3 years. We've been thoroughly experimenting with these concepts for more than one year. We can confidently say that we possess the knowledge, the experience, and the social capital to catalyze a focused effort by the multitude to build a sound infrastructure for a truly commons-based peer production system, for an open, decentralized, and self-organizing value network. Do you agree? Do you think we can make it happen? Do you want to get involved? Would love your thoughts- Assuming climate change is an indicator and result of an unsustainable system (fundamentally flawed systems design), but only a result/symptom (and not the root of the problem), and business and governments are focusing on "combatting climate change" (rather than taking a whole-systems approach), can they still somehow get to the root of the problem? 

Can climate focused initiatives fixed a fundamentally flawed system?? Many climate initiatives focus on carbon reductions, however, more advanced ones also focus on other critical issues such as sustainable buildings, renewable energy, etc. So, if the initiative is focused on a symptom, but still addresses other problems (especially within man-made systems), can it ultimately fix the system? I am a soldier of love standing with the people of the world I'd read this to all of my clients... I'm inclined to agree with implications of http://www.gamesforchange.org/learn/the-civic-potential-of-video-games/ that playing Sim City or Civilization are ritual acts of civic engagement that can have powerful implications for real life outside of games. I wonder if the path to ubiquity in that industry of ritual play with positive implications is through creating independent games, or through the socially responsible equivalent of product placement in games. I'm reminded of Edward Bernays who for a non-socially responsible cause (getting people to smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes), organized a sea change in opinion. The cigarettes were in green packaging and he figured out that was what was preventing them from selling. So he asked to change the color but the manufacturer said no. So he organized balls across the country "sponsored by the color green" for the elites in each community and was able to create a radical shift in public opinion with regards to the color green (it became massively more popular, and his business objectives were likewise successfully met). Could civics be integrated into the fabric of ritual - whether tv, film, gaming, real-life interaction in a way that increases the salience of socially responsible behavior through such rituals with a 21st century socially responsible emulation of what was tried for the color green? Is James Vasile from Freedombox.org here? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biJgILxGK0o If you are planning on attending CONTACT and also have a project that you want to fund, please see the document that I just created entitled Contact Projects Seeking Funding. 

Since I am working on supporting Contact from a funding perspective, I will explore creative strategies with funders that align projects, funders and CONTACT.

We all need to be creative and collaborative! One of the oft overlooked challenges of self-organizing systems are history--what happened before this, and moral intentionality, what should guide actions into the future.  We appear to have created an awesome capacity to organize briefly in the present that has outstripped our capacity to reflect on how we got here and the common purpose of our colelctive actio. Should we be talking about the potential for a global "Lucifer Effect" and what the antidote might be? If you are planning on attending the CONTACT Summit in NY in October (http://contactcon.com/), please see the new document I created to track attendees as well as discussion topics. Since CONTACT is an unconference, you can propose topics on the day of the event. Furthermore, since we all need to start thinking of Developing Sustained Change Processes that consist of events like CONTACT as well as infrastructure such as thi Facebook Group as a part of a larger Change Process, documenting what we want to talk about and engaging people in advance of the event will help us to get to know each other and to build relationships etc... thanks to Napier Collyns for pointing me at this
This, then, is the third crisis that can emerge: that the elites become delegitimized and all that there is to replace them is a deeply divided and hostile force, united in hostility to the elites but without any coherent ideology of its own. In the United States this would lead to paralysis. In Europe it would lead to a devolution to the nation-state. In China it would lead to regional fragmentation and conflict. http://www.guardian.co.uk/social-enterprise-network/2011/aug/09/shared-value-csr-social-enterprise Are many of the Transition Town people here?

When the soul lies down in that grass
the world is too full to talk about. For those interested in making sustainable living choices - legal - some of us have started a group https://www.facebook.com/groups/wguhr/   - So many people trying to do this run into zoning, idiotic HOA restrictions and prejudice in the areas which most need a long term vision.... I am working on a range of policies for a San Francisco mayoral campaign for a top candidate, including social enterprise. So, my question for y'all: If the City could do one thing to better support the work of social entrepreneurs and the organizations (like the Hub and SOCAP), what would it be? I think of this in two different ways -- 1, the city working directly with social enterprises to solve city problems, and 2, just making it easier for social entrepreneurs to get their businesses going, no matter the benefit population.

Ideas? Examples from other cities/countries? Thanks in advance for the help, friends! Thank you Willi Schroll and hi to everyone else! Excited to be here! Anyone know of any good research on levels of public awareness for "social enterprises" and "social entrepreneurs" in the U.S.? Dear People - Just a big thank you for the invite. I haven't had a lot of time until this morning to read the group. It's wonderful to be with people who do see positive potential in this moment...a stance and perspective not always so easy to maintain! THANK YOU.

Am honored to join this group of emergent curators of social transformation. Will follow the conversation with much interest and would appreciate any thoughts on our own efforts around transforming access to the law:

On going back to school at Stanford last year, I was drawn to the communities of socially and entrepreneurially minded change makers here. Myself and some lawyer/coder friends have started LawGives, a legal technology project which is piloting at Stanford Law School, focusing on the evolution of access to justice and legal education. People in need of legal help need to find legal information and help through less expensive and more intuitive ways. Law students need to gain more practical experience, particularly in potentially less lucrative, but more socially rewarding fields. Socially conscious lawyers need to find more ways to engage their legal skills for good. LawGives is building a platform to connect students with mentoring lawyers who work together to provide pro bono legal advice on cases that match their interests and abilities. On posting their legal issue on LawGives, their problems are classified and people then receive relevant free legal information and resources, as well as exposure to legal professionals who can help, either individually or in collaboration.

We're relentlessly optimistic about the prospect of helping people collaborate around real issues where the law plays a pivotal role, whether in working for individuals or larger movements and organizations on real cases, or in building up a shared knowledge base that is open to access and contribution by all. Though we're starting in California, we've international backgrounds, see what we're tackling as a global issue and would welcome any offers of connection and potential synergy, as well as the full spectrum of cynical and supportive feedback :) Thanks!

@MelanieCheng - re your post about incubation of Next Edge-style ideas, we've been asking similar questions and have come across some interesting "philanthrocapitalist funds", like Omidyar Networks, who are focussing on the double-bottom line approach. I also work for a Stanford University affiliated accelerator called StartX, which takes no equity, and has been helping several "social enterprises", like Carbon Lighthouse and 6dot innovations. Like them, we're looking to raise initial seed capital from angels who believe in our social mission, but also see a commercially sustainable model and returns on their investment, both socially and economically. Keen to see what other options are out there and also happy to discuss more about the hybrid non-profit / for profit model we're setting up.

@MarkFrazier - We also believe alternative currencies / value systems will play a huge role. We're looking to bring recognition and metrics to pro bono contributions, whether free legal advice to those in need, or contributions to a shared knowledge base. In our model, pro bono contributions - the number of "LawGives" a lawyer has - would serve as an additional way for the public to compare between individual lawyers when deciding who they want to engage. Curious to consider how this might fit into broader schemes you're exploring. Sorry to note ongoing riots in London organised via Twitter per ATCA's Self Assembling Dynamic Networks forecast for 2011 http://ow.ly/5XZ2b The slide deck for Contact, a gathering in New York on Oct. 20th that will bring together change agents, revolutionaries, technologists, academics, social innovators in a collaborative fashion to explore how we can take advantage of the new technological paradigm to bring about a better world!

Look Well to This Day
Anonymous, 50 B.C.

Look well to this day, 
For it and it alone is life. 
In its brief course 
Lie all the essence of your existence:

The Glory of Growth 
The Satisfaction of Achievement 
The Splendor of Beauty

For yesterday is but a dream,
And tomorrow is but a vision. 
But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, 
And every tomorrow a vision of hope.

My hope is that in some fractal design this practice might also contribute to your awareness & energy.

Love & light,
Jenn Wow- no bored kids when this kind of interface meets "next edge" learning! http://bit.ly/cSJHnF Thanks Willi Schroll #newplanetschool I know there's a discussion going on regarding whether we should (my way of saying it) inspire each other with our separate actions or collaborate on something(s) big.  Well, NASA and DARPA have organized a project to get people to collaborate on something Really Big: Plan how society needs to organize itself (scientifically and sociologically) so that 100 years from now we have BUILT A STARSHIP!

Jennifer There are two features that make conversations in this space much more interesting than on a traditional email list... 1. the Like feature and 2. the ability to reference specific people who are then personally notified... duly noted from standpoint of understanding conversation tools. Willi:  Your long post has a great deal in it. I am not a fast feeder of deep ideas.   I will get back to you but wanted you to know I support your idea of pulling together the critical/transformative intiatives. This has been my life's work, working with Carl Rogers and Paulo Freire as well as a multitude of alternative education practitioners from across the world. There is a deep and accomplished community of folks who have been building alternative praxis for many years. I will have more to say after I think through what I might add. Giday folks I met Vanessa when she was in Australia a few months ago and she invited me onto (y)our page.  I am involved, with my wife, in our business on Kids and Adults Learning http://www.kal.net.au/portal/  and i do the adult learning component please see http://biocharproject.org/news/  for my latest effort.  I strongly believe 'we are what we teach' (mental food) like 'we are what we eat' (physical food).  So in seeking to establish a learning enrichment foundation we strongly believe that adult learning comes from kids learning thus the name of our business and the layout of the website (from kids to adults learning - top menu bar on LHS - 'adult learning'.  
Anyway can say heaps more if relevant.

As Maureen says below we need to 'reinvent management' well if i may extend this I believe we have to 'reinvent education' - to a place between higher education and vocational training that is kids and adults learning 'because learning can be fun'.

Thx for the invite to an Aussie - Vanessa - and i hope i can contribute. ciao paul Just posted... how "personal currencies"  in the form of time gifts may help struggling nonprofits: http://is.gd/help4nonprofits . Can this converge in some way with upcoming ContactCon or SoCap currency pilots? Who's friends with Jean-François Noubel? I think he should be here. What is the larger objective of this Facebook Group? Is it just another forum for random ideas and chatting or is there a collective intention? Should there be a collective intention?

I ask this because I am a part of many listservs and I am trying to focus on spaces that are collaborative... where there is an intention and effort to do something together!

I find most email list environments are a forum for people to post their own ideas and info but there is little in the way of coordination...

I am pretty flexible as to what we do together as long as it serves the greater good in some way... It`s interesting how much the Like feature adds to a discussion thread... It`s the most simple form of meta-tagging (period). If we wanted to make meta-tagging of a discussion space a little more useful what other tags could we add? Too much of a good thing.... and in the email settings of the group there's no option to receive weekly digest instead the continuous daily avalanche. Any solution if am overwhelmed ANd do not want to completely turn off the notifications? tip for all these emails: i hear a lot of folks musing on all of signal/noise - just filter. create a folder in Gmail, use a filter to have all messages go directly past your inbox and into this folder, and you are set. customize notifications for your third party networks, then filter them all into folders that you can read on your own time. you can then download these entire folders, upload them all into google docs, upload individual threads, etc. it becomes very easy to manage, curate, and integrate without it being another inbox burden. How great are we? The chief proof of man's greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness! - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes Pretty good summary of the Rob Hopkins' book on the Transition movement. i find it quite wild observing how this scenius is operant across multiple platforms, google+, twitter, linked in, listservs and irl - a fluid many headed social consciousness with fuzzy boundaries that for some reason can manifest most coherently here on facebook (in the virtual realm) at this moment in time, from my perspective. it does feel that something magickal is sparking... that will persist until it doesn't and then will resurface in some other location :) 

each one of us is on our individual quests... what is the next step on your journey that perhaps this group might help you overcome?

http://www.SpaceUpLA.org an interesting cultural observation: HeeJung Lee did a quick analysis of this group a few days back and found that we were split roughly 50:50 on gender lines. However looking down the current stream participation is not reflective of that...  why might that be? Is it meaningless or is there something to be learned? http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-the-world-failed-haiti-20110804 What if cities and towns started investing in their own local food systems?

It is surely brimming with intelligent discussion. Meanwhile I felt like sharing this news item from India...and would like to put a question - How can this college be made successful and more quality oriented?

They are currently proposing BIG spending cuts to reduce their spending to $72,000 a year. These are the actual proportions of the federal budget & debt, reduced to a level that we can understand." - Dave Ramsey So, this should probably be connected with the "thought leader" "activities leader" discussion, but here you go: 

What ever happened to the concept of Praxis, wherein thought is informed by experience, which leads to more thought, and better action, and so on? 

I interviewed for a number of positions last year (when i thought i should have a job!! :) , and can't tell you how many times folks said, "oh, but you are a vision/thought guy--not really a manager!"--- and this to someone with 2 masters in administration and a successful NP start-up record over the past 20 years. How is it folks think those who manage can't think and those who think can't manage? 

As you say, DK, "...thoughts are arising and actions are occurring spontaneously..."

no wonder we're in such trouble around the world if thoughtful people can't lead organizations and those who are leading aren't expected to think! How do we measure results here? Do we?

I love 'curated emergence'. My question to all of us who are emerging is always - What if we learned how full consciousness really works, and then allowed our full consciousness to pull new organizational models, measures, and meaning over the horizons of our currently limited awareness? I've started a new project to transmit the original organizing principles of consciousness to people who are naturally 'waking up' and on the move to create change in the world. I've been running a pilot program with entrepreneurs, business and sustainability consultants, artists, and even a few scientists, and so far we've been able to create new ways of connecting, measuring, and re-emerging the inextricable value of the awakened individual to the collective. The other aspect that is emerging is the need to create new meaning and value, because these are the ultimate drivers of choice and definers of economies and all other social systems. I'd love to hear from people who are interested in learning more, and perhaps assisting with the development of the program. in another thread we talked about doing a few simple things to flex our ability to collectively do.

Contact me at jaspal@jobsforgood.com #9810996966 My thoughts on why, even for those who have moved past denial that our civilization is killing the world and that our way of life is unsustainable, it's so hard to get past denial that there is no hope of preventing our civilization from collapsing (only making collapse a little less awful). Some readers may find my position on this arrogant or negative, but it's really not intended to be. start a momvement to ban the use of the term "thought leader"?  I don't know about you all but I find the idea a bit scary. What surprises you the most? "Man... because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then he dies having never really lived." - Dalai Lama Is there a way for us to visually scan what's evolving at Next Edge?

The 2011 State of the Future is a concise, readable overview of the global situation, problems, solutions, and prospects for the future.  It covers the global landscape with two-page overviews with regional considerations of 15 global challenges such as energy, food, science & technology, ethics, development, water, organized crime, health, decisionmaking, gender relations, demographics, war & peace, and others. These together with the executive summary are ideal for busy executives, thought leaders, corporate strategic planners, public policy experts, policy advisors, non-profit issues organizations, teachers and professors of world issues, and anyone interested in a global overview of our prospects for the future – with discussions of problems and potential solutions.

It discusses a broad range of future-oriented policy initiatives such as shifting from fresh water-based agriculture to saltwater-based agriculture; making environmental security the focus of US-China strategic trust; a global strategy to counter organized crime; and collective intelligence as one of the next big things.

There are also special chapters on an Egyptian assessment of its post-revolution 34 priorities; 32 elements shaping future of the arts, media, and entertainment industries by 2020; four scenarios for the future of Latin America by 2030; international issues of environmental security, and the State of the Future Index.

It is produced by the Millennium Project with its 40 Nodes (groups of futurists and organizations) around the world, which collects, feeds back, and assesses insights from creative and knowledgeable people on emerging crises, opportunities, strategic priorities, and the feasibility of actions.

Let's create an entity to award that certificate. Let's market the hell out of the webinars, individually collectively, and see what kind of traction we have. Let's allow membership in the entity, which gives discounts on further webinars and certification programs. Thoughts? Why is the Euro so strong despite renewed crisis?

I find it very interesting that Deloitte are taking such a strong leadership position.. Is life less about what happens to us, and much more about how we react to it? Interesting to be tracking two related conversations occurring in different online spaces. For those of you not familiar with the Nat'l Coalition on Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD) they have a lively listserv - usually too lively for me to track it all, but I do dip in now and again.

Some members of TNE may find it of use: http://ncdd.org/rc/item/4067 Related to the post about the dream $100MM, where are the visionary investors/grantors who also have the diversification in their portfolio to take the risk on incubating early-stage Next Edge-style ideas?  I don't mean a handful of investments, but a whole fund or several funds that have Next Edge-minded managers AND the collective cash to put a lot more of these models into motion.  Do they exist?  Tied to that, are there any examples of major world-bettering businesses where the staff are paid market rates? In this group, I know of several folks who are living off savings and/or making less than they made in the corporate world, or who have taken a blah corporate job to pay the bills. What will it take for all of us contributing our brain/business power to doing good to get compensated "fairly"?  Goes back to first question: where are the funders and where is the capital for all of our work?  Really, I'd love to know...! our friend Bobby Fishkin is a finalist in the HUB / McKinsey Management 2.0 Challenge - he has been "encouraged by the organizers of the competition to seek constructive comments on our innovation from people we know as part of the final stage of competition. I thought that you might possibly be willing to add a constructive comment on it. I think this could add to shared understanding. We have been encouraged to  to respond to constructive criticism with further iterations / revisions / enhancements / analysis / planning this month."

(This was written as a response to an Invitation to respond to “Global MegaCrisis: Four Scenarios on the Future of Progress”, for a Special Issue, Journal of Futures Studies, Dec 2011, upon request of Jose Ramos.)

“The world today is confronting not one crisis, but possibly several at the same time. Each crisis has different temporal aspects, but all are involved in different subphases of development." Anyone remember Popular Science magazIne? It's web presence ("The Future Now") is here...

http://inside.flipboard.com/2011/07/23/enter-the-future-with-popsci-and-these-featured-feeds/ I keep chewing on the idea of opening an Environmental Therapy Office in San Francisco. 

We go there if it's to scary to think of the future, if we get paralyzed by the stuff that  Dave Pollard notes, the "incredible grief and sorrow we feel, and are going to feel a lot more, because of the staggering amount of suffering and desolation we have inflicted on our poor planet, and the realization that, now, the only way out is through, and through, especially for our children and grandchildren, is going to be harrowing and sometimes ghastly."   It's like a storefront.  But it sells hope in action form, not hope in consumer product form. And inside are humans, and when you leave, after one of those humans has listened to your pain and fear and hope, you have a thing that you can do, that's special for you, and it's an action that gives you hope. You go there like you go to therapy. And it keeps us going.  It's staffed with all flavors of action creators, ones who help us call attention to the present, in reference to our future.  And the action creators, they talk to each other, and they're transparent about where the whole thing is going, but respect the confidentiality of the clients.

And in addition to buying the organic peach, and riding the bus to work, we do more in the right directions.

Could that exist? Is it the right scale?  Does it already exist? Part of my healing practice and one I put into use with my clients is the art of moving forward with intention at all levels.  This year, I set my primary intention as listening (to elephants, people and the wind, etc.) It has been powerful.

Rachel: I love your idea of an alternative Therapy practice.  For those of us drawn to creating containers for healing I thank you for putting it out as an intention.  I give a fun workshop that includes creativity, sound and setting intention!  Looking for more venues to co-create!

David: Thanks for the invite! Here's an abstract of my paper at APA Rachel . 

The Humanistic Psychologist 

Volume 38, Issue 2, 2010 

Another Inconvenient Truth and the Developmental Role for Psychology in a Threatened World
Maureen O'Hara. 

Abstract
There is a reciprocal relationship between the external lifeworlds that human individuals and communities inhabit (psychospheres) and the inner psychological landscape of conceptual coherence, cognitive strategies, identity, and meaning. In times of cultural turbulence, when basic assumptions about reality are challenged, there is often a corresponding challenge to psychological coherence on a cultural scale. The 21st century global context is increasingly incoherent, disrupting previously coherent psychospheres and provoking a global conceptual emergency with widespread mental distress. At the same time, climate change, the most dangerous of a cluster of global threats, requires urgent and coordinated action. It is likely that a more mature psychology will be required for this than is currently the global norm. The key to making the changes to necessary avoid global catastrophe humanely and effectively will be more psychological than technical. In the mid-20th century, humanistic psychology founders hoped humanistic psychology would provide theory and praxis for an emancipatory social movement that would avoid the catastrophe of nuclear holocaust. In the face of today's threats, the need for such a project is now more urgent than ever. In light of this, the author proposes the best and highest goals of psychological practice and training should be to address the challenge of creating a new culture or psychosphere that both cultivates and sustains a psychologically healthy humanity long enough to address the potential planetary catastrophe that looms at the same time that it addresses the pain of the inevitable psychological disruptions and the opportunity for transformative growth What is your quest? Get to know Deborah Frieze: Consciousness is going mainstream . . . well, at least it is being talked about--that is progresss. Do you like the term serial entrepreneur? Interesting new book out, move over Darwin. The Destination of the Species: The Riddle of Human Experience . . . This group feels like the opening circle in an Open Space meeting with 200+ awesome people. I sense excitement, lots of sparks, tremendous potential. However the plenary format prevents us from going on extended riffs on any one topic for fear of boring the others.

I wonder if it might be a good idea to start theme-specific 'subtracks'? We could use a Doc to keep a list of such tracks and who's interested. For instance, I'd be keen on going deep on new currency with whoever is interested *cough* Jordan Greenhall  Charles Eisenstein Devin Balkind *cough*.

What do y'all think? I've never been good at following rules that I didn't have a say in creating... Still, I appreciate the invite. Perhaps this will get me to spend more time on FB - a place I rarely visit. So many wonderful people here. Tis good to see y'all! http://www.unelected.org/audit-of-the-federal-reserve-reveals-16-trillion-in-secret-bailouts A small census of tools developed between 1860 and the present for participatory control over land and water:

- the documentation of indigenous/collective property law, c. 1860 
- the state-mandated buying out of large chunks of land in favor of downward, sustainable redistribution of landed property, c. 1870
- the application of land taxes towards the downward redistribution of property, c. 1890
- collaborative resource mapping, c. 1920
- community land trusts, c. 1930
- marches of the landless to protest land policy on the national level, c. 1930
- public trust doctrine, 1972
- low tech, including seed-sharing programs, c 1975
- microcredit, c 1980
- a legal and economic database of common pool resources, demonstrating how and when their rules become effective, c 1983 
- creative-commons copyleft, extension of intellectual property rights to communities, c. 1990

Open questions:

-  What kind of infrastructure exists for coordinating, sharing information about, and coordinating these diverse tendrils into an economic system?

- What kind of valuation/rating system would accredit the long-term political stability that the above systems have achieved over the course of their evolution (some of them over a century old at this point)?  Is it possible to 

- Can we understand these tools in a spectrum from those appropriate for the village to those appropriate to the nation, rather than a competition between decentralized and government action?

- Some of these tools are more appropriate to different types of community, individuals, than others.  For instance, community mapping makes a lot of sense if you're a woman in an Indian village, but public trust doctrine is more useful if you're a law school student.  What sort of a vision or economic system encourages individuals to promulgate the type of tools appropriate to their own situation, with an understanding of similar tools applicable in nearby settings?

- Surveyors belong to the rich. Because only the few can afford to pay surveyors, deal with lawyers, and negotiate with government, breaking up traditional commons in places like Mali means destroying tribes, creating new local elites. So what kind of property rights protect the poor? (this can be answered by looking at India)
- Does the growing power of agrobusiness and vertical interests leave any room for continuing grassroots organization in land, or will they be crushed? 
- Tribal rights, pre-existing commons, and new forms of commons have been around for up to 700 years in some cases, and upwards of thirty in the cases of many back-to-the-land movements. As we build forward-looking markets, is there a way of acknowledging in terms of credit the human and political infrastructure of these strong community organizations, in such a way that they would stand up to the rearrangement of property rights through economic pressure? 
- Land redistribution was looked to in Ireland, Scotland, India, and parts of Latin America to break up the power of gigantic landlords, early in the twentieth century. There, the state bought out landlords at market prices, redistributed them, and so laid the groundwork for millions of smallholders, each responsible for their own land and livelihood. This was seen as an alternative to the state investing in education, outside investors, or other forms of infrastructure. In parts of India, this form of redistribution seems to have paid off as small landholders became mini-industrialists, investing the small production from their plots of land into new inventions. What role has the state in creating a culture of smallholders? Under what conditions are private investors incentivized to invest in smallholders? 
- What is the role of alternative market valuation, including the rating of environmental contributions, in microcredit and microlending? 
- How long is the expected return on investment in microlending schemes? 
- Land ceilings were looked to in large parts of India to create a diverse small-holder economy. Small farms are shown to be more productive per hectare, better for the environment. What sort of a credit scheme would recognize environmental contributions? In my work with MG Taylor and, now, Tomorrow Makers, Zwicky Boxes have been wonderful design tools. Legend even has it that the M & G of MG Taylor even used a Zwicky Box to create their wedding ceremony! Hi all,

Based on an earlier post to the group by Seb Paquet and follow up suggestions from David Hodgson and Jay Standish, join a conference call on "new currencies" happening next week.

We’re down and we’ll be alright There are currently 182 members of this "Secret Group", and I know very few of you. That's my primary motivation for inviting you all to answer the following three questions. But I'm also asking to see if there are some common threads that can help pull this group together into a "community of constructive, transformational action", and that's because a transformation in the world view of humanity is so desperately needed.

The three questions:

What is the core contribution you are making to the world with your existing work?
What contribution do you wish you were making that you're not yet making?
Who or what influenced you the most in choosing the path you are on in your life today... and what is that you learned from that person or thing? had lovely meeting this morning with Sylvia Ventura Barahona Garazi Konde Untzilla Mariah Howard Maura Dilley Rebecca Petzel Jordan Grader and came to an interesting insight - co working is a step on a continuum of trans organizational coherence - it is a working in the same space, but the organizational boundaries are still limiting in interaction possibilities - the next step is interoperation - where if purpose and directionality are shared, then organizational boundaries become transparent - it is not co-being, it is inter-being The bad news: there is no key to the universe. The good news: it was never locked. Swami Beyondananda Welcome Robert Paterson.

Topics as have been discussed here over that last weeks. Local currencies and more! from Sheri Herndon "GLOBAL SYNCHRONIZED MOMENT OF LOVE
Ten Years and Ten Hours after the first plane strike on 9/11, we are inviting at least 3,000,000 people send a wave of love around the planet to help us all collectively shift from a fear consciousness into love consciousness on this powerful day." An article by physicist Marc Buchanan in Bloomberg gives a layperson’s summary of an important paper by Yale economist John Geanakoplos, and Doyne Farmer, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute. It shows that the conventional use of discounted cash flow models over long time periods, as is often the case when discussing environmental impacts, is fatally flawed. And this finding comes after the publication of a paper by Andrew Haldane and Richard Davies of the Bank of England, which proves what many have long surmised: that businesses use overly high discount rates, which is how you build short-termism into financial models. Needless to say, that assures underinvestment, particularly in infrastructure. Projects with paybacks beyond the 30 to 35 year time frame are treated as having no value at all. 'creating a transnational mythic structure for the global civilization that is emerging' Directionally, what would you/we like to do with this space?

The lyrics are touching me each time, I hear it. They adress in an excellent way the question of responsibility for our problems. I believe, this question is a key to the needed change. What do you think and feel about the songs message?

Have you heard the news that's going 'round here
The man in charge has got to go
Cause he dances 'round the problem, boy
And the problem is the man in charge you know
Now, the young knows what I'm talking 'bout
It's a con in the old man's game
The man in charge, he don't know what he's doing
He don't know the world has changed
Power seems to be so far up
The man on the street ain't got a clue
The high top cats running your life
Think the problem is me and you
Born in a time that has gone by
The old tell the young what to do
Have you heard the news that's going 'round here
The problem is the man in charge of you
The problem is the man in charge of you

Which led me to ask what is a Social Venture?  Someone suggested "any business that generates social & community value as part of its mission & operations.  Which leads me to ask:  what is social and community value? What is it to you?  What does this mean to you? Imagine that-promises as currency? Good thing we keep ours :)!

This is really good!!! 25 years of experience and data! Wonderful musings .... enjoyed Jerry Michalski video, thx. My recent FB post:  "Our task is to live in touch with the flow of nature. Recognizing our innate sufficiency, fullness, abundance, intimacy with all things intimacy with all life. An intimacy which enables us to focus on maximizing relationships, and build an economy of reciprocal blessing built on beauty, art, kindness and symbiosis." I love it!

Please print this & put it in your wallet or somewhere where you can read it once a day. 

Like a vitamin goes through your system. We need inspiration daily:

Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. (anonymous).

Be well, be courageous.
Jenn I've been pondering for the few days I have been on this group why I feel like asking if we can set a daily limit on the use of the words honor, compassion, integrity, system, sacred and deep? It's not that those words don't have uses, its just they lose meaning through overuse. Their overuse is also potentially alienating by coming across as an attempt to appropriate them as the jargon of an exclusive group - in this case those wise (another candidate for rationing in my book) few who understand the sustainability imperative. Just a thought. I met Paul Gilding this May in San Francisco w/ Napier Collyns & David Hodgson. I think TheNextEdge is a great place to practice the behaviors & communication skills that will carry across this great disruption. Communication, collaboration, and compassion are the tools I think we need to sharpen across the board. Believe me, I am looking in the mirror. how do you wire up the nervous system of the empathic civilization? This is some of the juiciest stuff in all my socialnets, and is where I'm spending the least time. Hmmm. in this created context is it too early to ask what is signal and what is noise? (a systems thinking compliant post laden w a subtle soupcon of humble integrity). Humility in the midst of opulence . . . Passion has sharp edges; that is why compassion is so vital. Some answers can be give! Great!! 1) My core contribution at the moment is that I bring people, various actors togheter around the world (hopefully they dont know eachother!!), with somewhat similar interests, and thereafter i support the initiatives the come out of the encounters. Often great things develop out of these processes. 2) Next step would be to invest in these ideas. I cannot do that now, but its a question of time. 3) Cant see someting 100 % in this case. Many people and things have inspired!! Next Edge meet Better Block FOR LOVERS OF THE BIG PICTURE:                                                                    
"Millions of women, men, and youth, around the world are investing their talents and passion into weaving the fabric of transformation to a sustainable world, through their everyday actions and engagement in projects that make a difference.                                                                                                 

Yet, without a global-scale of collective intelligence, wisdom, capacities and a meta-narrative of patterns that connect, it is unlikely that we’ll make it to the other shore of the turbulent waters of our species existence.

What can be a meta-story big enough to cover and support the epic transformation that we are going through?

Where to look for the signs worth monitoring to discover that meta-story?

I will post the ideas/images as they emerge from holding that question.

Would you do the same?"                                                                                 

That quote is from my blog entry of "Co-evolving with you" http://coevolvingwithyou.wordpress.com/2011/01/01/hello-world/ posted the first day of this year, where you will also find some related stories. If any of my fellow next-edgers was keenly interested to discover the meta-story, I'd offer to co-host with her/him a collaborative learning journey into it, as a rigorous, focused inquiry, using the co-blogging space of "Co-evolving with you." 

I imagine, we would then bring back the summaries from the log of our learning expedition, here, to the larger Next Edge community. If you're interested drop me a line. "The power of the few individuals at the top counterbalances the weakness of the masses." I was deeply impact by David Hawking's "Power vs. Force" in that he shows us how simple word choices carry incredible power.  Perhaps the greatest way we can support "the commons & collective" is simply to be more mindful of our word choices and "intent." I'm reminded of forms of art like yarn bombing which build on multi-generational traditions of yarn knitting and graffiti in order to  communicate ideas that can only be told as a hybrid of these forms.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/fashion/creating-graffiti-with-yarn.html. I think that Yes Men (http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?trkid=921407&movieid=70112470) similarly tell narratives that can only be told by merging traditions of impersonation, satire,and  hacking in a context of insanely fast dissemination of media stories. I think multi-disciplinary art is really important when thinking about multi-disciplinary innovation because such projects depend on this  diagonal manner of thinking.  There are many core innovations which are sufficiently meta in aspiration that they will need to tell stories of there existence through an explanation of their implications across multiple disciplines. Global Innovation Commons (patents that are reusable - http://www.globalinnovationcommons.org/content/about) or likeminded.org/ (a library of many thousand creative commons social innovations for neighborhoods  or one of any number of social innovation acceleration initiatives- http://www.youngfoundation.org/our-work/international-ii/the-global-innovation-academy/the-global-innovation-academy ) are all reflective of such an inter-disciplinary kind of approach. It will be interesting what art forms will need to be created to tell those stories. Delighted to be included and ready to get my Edge on! Thanks, David Hodgson! found via @Anni Roolf All teams operate as independent cooperative companies. Students have to do real-life projects, which they have to find themselves, to cover all the expenses of the company. Projects function both as learning environments (for studies and developing the individual’s competence) and as ways of doing business (for team companies). Learning is a process that is not divided into modules or subjects like marketing or leadership.

Team Academy has no control over its team companies; it only provides the coaching for the learning process. The main methods are learning by doing and team learning. Projects offer opportunities to apply studied theory directly into practise and also provide a platform for students to reflect on theory in light of their own experiences while studying.

Teams use dialogue as a tool to share knowledge and think together. The purpose of dialogue is to go beyond one individual’s understanding – the whole organizes the parts, rather than trying to pull the parts into a whole. In dialogue, people become observers of their own thinking. Dear Bees from the Hive of Humanity,
While you are doing some amazing things to change the trajectory of the globe, sustainability, ecosystems etc--please, please, please take care of your physical life and your primary relationships. Our ability to make impact relies on our ability to model from the inside-out. You are more than your blogs, your projects, your achievments, your ambitions. Please keep perspective between "the ideas" & "the source." In deep practice, Jenn if we want to heal the Earth, we need to start with the soil... Manifesto: Life is Short. Live your dream and share your passion.

After all, wisdom is wisdom. Reading a paper Ostrom delivered post her Nobel on handling pooled resources, here are the design principles she discovered in healthy systems, from police forces in small cities and big, to watersheds managed by government or by ranchers:
This is what works, she says:

Boundaries of users and resource are clear

Congruence between benefits and costs

Users had procedures for making own rules

Regular monitoring of users and resource conditions

Graduated sanctions

Conflict-resolution mechanisms

Minimal recognition of rights by government http://www.pvpulse.com/en/news/world-news/bolivia-set-to-pass-historic-law-of-mother-earth-which-will-grant-nature-equal-rights-to-humans http://www.cccb.org/lab/en/generes-mutants/el-crowdfunding-com-cavall-de-troia-del-procomu/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo5Unn3AkVY http://www.social-capital.net/resources.php

Colin Campbell who founded "Assist Social Capital" has collected a lot of good info around resilience, community building, networking and such stuff under link above! You might find it useful if you work in this field!

Best from sunny Sweden, Bert-Ola I'm starting an MBA in whole-systems sustainability this fall at bgi.edu If any of you pass through Seattle, it would be great to see if we can have you as a guest at BGI- there are frequently folks like Hunter Lovins who come as visiting faculty. I'd love to help some of these next edge conversations pollinate into BGI. Ping me if a trip to Seattle might be in your future. What activates us? What gets us moving? Welcome everyone. The Next Edge was a phrase Venessa Miemis coined in conversation at my house a couple of months back as a container for those of us creating and embodying the transformative emergent new paradigms of being & doing as a response to the profound challenges we face at this moment of the 21st century. This group was started as an experiment in curated emergence to see what value might be co-created. I have had some success fostering "corporate consciousness" with some key practices & messags with our book Strategy Leadership & the Soul. People really need to see themselves differently to understand how much their micro-choices impact the macro. I am in "awe" when I think of how much wisdom was available in 325 BC.
We don't need more information to become more ethical. We simply need to hold ourselves to a higher standard. Let me say that a different way: I need to hold myself to a higher standard. I believe behavior is learned by peers--and the only way to make impact is to have more and more individuals model behaviors at higher levels.  We have enough power to create a tipping point-join me? The visible & invisible working together to create the miraculous.

House Speaker Boehner Pulls Out of Debt Ceiling Talks

The Republican House speaker, John A. Boehner, said Friday that he had broken off talks with President Obama on getting a budget deal to avert a government default.

Mr. Boehner said that Mr. Obama wanted to raise taxes too high and won’t make “fundamental changes” to benefit programs such as Medicare.

Top Republican aides said Mr. Boehner would now work with Senate leaders on an alternative aimed at averting a market-rattling, first-ever federal default. Change occurs through vibrations. Here is one of my favorites when I need calm, quiet, rest . . . May tomorrow be filled with more grace, beauty, and kindness. . . I wonder what assets lie within/at The Next Edge?  ... We could build an Next Edge asset map by thinking of a couple of specific, concrete assets: Head (what do you know?), Heart (what are you passionate about?), Hands (what can you do?) ... Maybe one would be something that we would share freely w/ ease and another might be more precious please contact only when really needed... Is anyone interested in building on this idea or jumping into the stream? ... on the topic of the commons .. The collapse of fisheries worldwide endangers the livelihoods and food security of tens of millions of people. These fisheries are often small and ill-suited to top-down regulatory intervention. In many cases, a “tragedy of the commons” scenario—in which each individual fisherman seeks only to maximize his own catch—leads to overfishing and collapse. But a recent article in Nature describes a different, far more promising trend. It analyzes the surprisingly successful preservation of small fisheries through devolved systems of comanagement. Call to Change “pilot program” solution includes the "business model"—simpler for customers and more accessible to customers—and the “management model”—back to productivity. Through an eco-system approach that integrates the private, public and government sectors working together, an educational program for the 21st Century combined with practice by action learning, we can create an innovative system that brings economic growth, increased stability and quality of life for your community—a strategy that cares about culture, has social responsibility, protects the environment and has economic sustainability with diversity as a core value. Hello to you all, here for you something about my work. Have a good weekend! Feeling a little existential trance this morning. May you influse energy into all that you do today! WOW i would not have expressed these with such clarity but I guess these are what all of us share. Sounds as the rules I follow in daily life so I will be glad to be active in this group!! Also I would like to thank you David Hodgson for all the very interesting and in many ways  useful info you have spread over the last months I have been active at FB! It has certainly resulted in many concrete activities I can tell!! Best from sunny Sweden, Bert-ola Thank you David and hello everyone else. Lovely to be amongst you! Jocelyn-I was thinking something similar to what the Open Source Myth guys did- way cool and way collective :) a tribute to the nascent birth of The Next Edge and the beautiful souls riding it: 

Quietness by Rumi

Inside this new love, die.
Your way begins on the other side.
Become the sky.
Take an axe to the prison wall.
Escape.
Walk out like someone
suddenly born into color.
Do it now.
You're covered with thick cloud.
Slide out the side. Die,
and be quiet. Quietness is the surest sign
that you have died.
Your old life was a frantic running
from silence.

The speechless full moon
comes out now. is there also a next edge group migrating to google+ ? wondering pros/cons of each space. Ever wonder what "collective intelligence" in action or "the next edge" sound like? Ferry Costen gets us pretty close! May your day be energized! David, 
Honored to be here with all you other bees from the hive of humanity.
Cheers to connectivity & progress! I've been working in a related area on deliberative governance of organizations: http://www.managementexchange.com/hack/deliberative-corporation We recognize that SENSORICA is a living system. Viewed from this perspective, our job as architects of this new type of organization is to put in place the proper constraints in order to make the system evolve towards a specific attractor, a dynamically stable pattern that exhibits a set of desired characteristics. oh. if one believes that transnational corporations are a better global political system than nations, then one no longer sees a point to things like income tax, and wants to privatize ALL services and infrastructure, and declares martial law to remove pesky irrelevant organizations like ineffectual school boards rather than running for office, and in fact wants pliable, insane chief executives who distract the "nation" with circus. google+ is a fun place to play - i would love to connect with you all there - so please connect, if we aren't: http://gplus.to/davidhodgson - and if you would like an invite please add a comment on this post.. Edge play, all-time favorite. TEDx talk from one of our group... i'm pretty sure David McConville & Jessica Margolin also have tedx talks.. if you do please post them to group :) Here was my TEDx from last year. Looking forward to getting to know each other's shared visions. so i've just had an idea.. hangouts in google+ are a very interesting experience - and we can assemble a very diverse, creative group of thinkers in a very spontaneous way (the next edge) - that strikes me as an experience other people, from large organizations, would like to engage with - spontaneous, creative, group mind - ideal for thinking about tricky situations.. science itself starting to get smart by reflecting, quantitatively, on the nature of discovery.

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/146.summary You are allowed to:

1.     Make the decision you think is the right decision to make

2.     Start something that needs to be started to help advance the cause

3.     Ask for help whenever you want it

4.     Help others whenever you can (even if they don’t ask for it)

5.     Take time off to do something that inspires, excites and energizes you

Everyone is expected to follow these rules and everyone is expected to hold the others accountable to them. Afterall, if we didn't follow the rules...there'd be chaos. Interesting... there is now a group chat box on FB ... competition makes better products options for users :) http://www.managementexchange.com/hack/%22quests%22-organizing-principles I'll note also that today Google opened Google+ to some peeps, and will be rolling more soon. Should we be over there? i kind of like that it says Secret Group at the top of the page... Thanks for the invite, David. I like it. what do you need help with? i love edges.
