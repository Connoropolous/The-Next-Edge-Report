Central planning works for organizations, which have hierarchical network structure. However, those central plans become increasingly vague the larger the organization. Plan specificity necessarily decreases as the knowledge available and needed necessarily increases. Thus, the information becomes less and less clear and specific. But, again, this is for an organization with hierarchical network structure. The larger the corporation, though, the more and more it begins to resemble a scale-free network, even though it can never really achieve that kind of organization, precisely because there is \\\"someone\\\" in charge. \\n\\nSocial systems like economies, however, are scale-free, self-organizing network processes. There is and can never be anyone in charge, and there is and can never be a telos to such a process.

One can build a system piece by piece, adjusting where appropriate to make sure the pieces all fit, and have something that works fairly well, yet one nevertheless cannot take that system and impose it elsewhere.

And you proceed to act as if you've been friends since childhood?\\n\\nChudi Igboemeka is one of those friends for me.\\n\\nWe met at the height of the Internet boom in a bar in Palo Alto, CA a couple blocks from my place. We used to smoke weed, and hang out with smart and beautiful women, and go to work the next day and our work was better for it. Chudi and I didn't hang out with women because we were chasing them, we just liked them better. We appreciated women for the wonderful creatures they were. I never would have found my wonderful wife Jen if not for the high standards one gets after hanging out with strong, powerful, playful and delightfully unpredictable women as friends. Chudi helped me learn how to do this effortlessly. To drop the male apprehension.\\n\\nChudi had a smile so big, and love energy so kind, that women\u2014who notice these things\u2014would come up to him and introduce themselves. I'm sure its even better know that's its wise too. One of my favorite memories of my whole life was a wild weekend in Vegas sponsored by one of the bright flaming stars of the first Internet boom, I brought Chudi along.\\n\\nWhat I remember most about that weekend was the laughter.\\n\\nMany of my favorite memories of my life involve Chudi, sitting listening to chill music, discussing the world and what it was like, and what it might be.\\n\\nI haven't been in the same place as Chudi in years. But I always said to myself, when I finally figure out exactly what I'm going to do, my place, and I need a partner in adventure, Chudi will have a place by my side, if he wants, when he wants, doing whatever he wants.\\n\\nSon of a Nigerian father and a mother from St. Kitts, and raised in the Kitchener\/Waterloo\/Toronto area:\\n\\nWelcome the finest gentleman I have ever known.\\n\\nChudi, this place is special to me. We are here working on ways to change the world together. Check out the discussions for a bit and then lets talk about what you'd most like to do in the whole world.

One of the obstacles for many of the ideas is that they live rather far away from the \\\"point of consumption\\\", the place in people's lives where they will gain tangible benefit from the outcomes of applying ideas. So, the projects tend to seek either the free time of software developers with a possibility of future reward, or donation-based funding (kickstarter, etc), or some kind of philanthropic grants\/donations from larger institutions. Many times this donating of time or funds fails to gain momentum or materialize. Projects stall, people become frustrated, etc. The cycle repeats around a new idea. (this is leaving aside interpersonal dynamics, and quests for power, that also play a big role in sabotaging goodwill that could make these projects actually work once in a while, but I digress...)\\n\\nI've personally come to the conclusion personally that investing in commons requires building commons (open source software, hardware, education resources, access to space, land, time, energy, etc) around rather boring but productive commercial activity around producing food, energy, and physical goods. The economics are quite simple: there is a massive demand for certain variants all three that far outstrips supply (fresh local organic food, renewable energy, modular and adaptable physical goods and technologies). It also turns out that using commons as a foundation for these market activities actually can give you competitive advantage against those who are averse to commons, and cooperative connection to those who participate (even when they otherwise seem like competitors). Fulfilling these needs also focuses the more general ideas around things like alternative economies, social media technologies, etc into practical supportive directions, with economies that can sustain funding for a long time. It's my opinion that if done right, the revenue from food, energy and physical production can fund the kinds of work people are trying to do here. This is what I am engaged in now, and it's already paying off. \\n\\nMy purpose in writing this is to simply share it, for whatever it is worth.

Perhaps, as a result, when we need to walk away from particular online communities or just the internet as a time suck, we feel we can't leave something of ourselves there- we can't stop owning our words (even if they may be out of date or not where we are any more).

which would be 11:45pm tonight - I can't figure anywhere in the world that would even be close to 10:30pm !\\n\\nWhatever you think of the power of globally synchronised symbolic events (rather than concrete lasting actions) - they aren't going to work if people don't know when they happen.\\n\\nHopefully they'll get it fixed in the 10-31 hours between now and then :-)\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267900413297720\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267900413297720\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-30T20:17:21+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-30T20:46:18+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"595040919\",\"name\":\"Cameron Burgess\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NTk1MDQwOTE5\",\"before\":\"NTk1MDQwOTE5\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"267915796629515\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Cameron Burgess\",\"id\":\"595040919\"},\"message\":\"hilarious ... and points to the fact that while the technology may exist, and the willingness to use it, perhaps we haven't quite wrapped our heads around the necessary functional intelligence to make it work ...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-30T20:46:18+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MjY3OTE1Nzk2NjI5NTE1\",\"before\":\"MjY3OTE1Nzk2NjI5NTE1\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_267885596632535\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Myra Occupy Graham\",\"id\":\"1219320591\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"I choose Paradise....\\nhttp:\/\/www.paradiseoroblivion.com\/watch.html\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQAipsByD_FdZDzy&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paradiseoroblivion.com%2Fparadise-or-oblivion-poster.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.paradiseoroblivion.com\/watch.html\",\"name\":\"PARADISE or OBLIVION | official page\",\"caption\":\"www.paradiseoroblivion.com\",\"description\":\"PARADISE or OBLIVION | a documentary by The Venus Project | the official website.\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267885596632535\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267885596632535\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-30T19:49:45+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-30T19:49:45+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_267881036632991\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Hildy Gottlieb\",\"id\":\"648098840\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"caption\":\"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267881036632991\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/267881036632991\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-30T19:40:57+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-30T19:40:57+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_267266520027776\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"I like Chris Blattman for perusing development economics and for being a great blogger.

I pause partly because of Pritchett's professional history and partly because of the handling of ending the fule subsidy in Nigeria for which Okonjo-Iweala is accountable.

We have cross-cultural communication tools today that enable us to be with and see each other - and to work together on our collective challenges and opportunities - in marvelous new ways. Unfortunately our cultures have conditioned us to see the world through the lens of pending doom. \\n\\nWhat if the challenge of our lifetime is not just to be the change, but to move ourselves and societies around us beyond the crisis conditioned mindset. To believe that change is possible, people need to be able to SEE change.

The vast majority of us are not attention seeking folk, by nature, but we need to figure out ways for more people to see and believe in the positive kinds of changes that are both happening and possible now. Perhaps the continuing convergence of dramatic change on so many levels - moral, economic, environmental, gender rebalancing, technological - offers people like us some very unique opportunities... if only we could figure out how to get the visibility piece right.  \\n\\nI have a tremendous amount of faith in the world's extended army of living angels today.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-29T16:56:30+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"267171650037263\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Elle D'Coda\",\"id\":\"1460015104\"},\"message\":\"\\\"Doing it\\\" here too with an alternative for health care at the Herbal Coaching Community (serious game)...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-29T16:57:38+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"267172383370523\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Christina Jordan\",\"id\":\"504778241\"},\"message\":\"and meant to still add, that when I think of the world I want to live in, it's the one where we can see change happening and not be terrified of it, but welcoming.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-29T16:58:52+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"267184510035977\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"id\":\"736739458\"},\"message\":\"Yeah Elle D'Coda.

Here is one measure of the problem: if we continue to do exactly what we are doing, with no growth in the human population or the world economy, the world in the latter part of this century will be unfit to live in. Of course human activities are not holding at current levels\u2014they are accelerating, dramatically\u2014and so, too, is the pace of climate disruption, biotic impoverishment, and toxification. In this book Gus Speth, author of Red Sky at Morning and a widely respected environmentalist, begins with the observation that the environmental community has grown in strength and sophistication, but the environment has continued to decline, to the point that we are now at the edge of catastrophe.\\n \\nSpeth contends that this situation is a severe indictment of the economic and political system we call modern capitalism. Our vital task is now to change the operating instructions for today\u2019s destructive world economy before it is too late.

It can takes hours...and perhaps even just minutes to start a complex system, because anything humans do together is already a complex system.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-28T15:44:59+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"266548226766272\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bill Seitz\",\"id\":\"608431239\"},\"message\":\"Taleb's prologue is online at http:\/\/www.fooledbyrandomness.com\/prologue.pdf (I haven't read it yet)\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-28T16:12:00+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"266721010082327\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\",\"id\":\"516134310\"},\"message\":\"A (long and somewhat tedious) speech by Taleb explaining anti-fragility is here: http:\/\/www.sas.upenn.edu\/ppe\/Events\/Goldstone\/Goldstone2011.htm\\n\\nJean Russell thanks for keeping me honest. I agree that we work with complex systems, and that \\\"anything humans do together is a complex system\\\", but that doesn't mean we can _create_ or _design_ complex systems. A permaculture forest garden is a massive series of relatively knowledgeable complicated interventions in a complex system designed to modify an altered environment in hopefully helpful ways to restore its natural fertility and diversity. Once that's done, the 'creator' of that complex system (whatever you choose to call her) will look after it from there, in varying, exploratory, complexity-increasing, restorative and unpredictable ways. That's the best we can do.\\n\\nThe Internet has some interesting complex aspects that evolved -- they were not deliberately designed (in fact a consortium of large corporations in the early 1980s tried to create an alternative non-complex complicated \\\"Internet 2\\\" under their management and control because they thought the Internet would fall apart for lack of rigorous human \\\"design\\\"). Ultimately because it is built on a corporatist infrastructure it is only partially complex -- and the complicated aspects (privately owned and closely controlled servers, hardware and networks) will likely, with the advent of Peak Oil, economic collapse, and ecological turmoil, spell the end of the Internet as we know it. Unless we're able to somehow smash the corporatist concentration of power over its critical elements and let it become, like a true social system, more complex and hence, more adaptive.

Gore & Associates in 1958. At that time the whole organization of this company was futuristic and science fiction in the eyes of commoners. Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore who founded it together with his wife Vieve had been additionally proclaimed anti-manager. The organization resided on principles like complete decentralization, self-organizing teams, flat hierarchy and organizational chaos. The concept of the amoeba is a biocybernetic metaphor since its original ancient Greek meaning implies change or changeability. Especially a known subform of the  Amoeba Proteus the so called Amoeba Chaos Chaos underlines the connection between chaos theory and this kind of organization. The amoeba organization relies on two simple but strong principles: (1) the organization is a process,  not a structure, and (2) the organization is a complex (chaotic) system.\\\"\",\"message_tags\":{\"27\":[{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":27,\"length\":12}]},\"link\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"name\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"caption\":\"indecs.eu\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-24T14:07:46+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-28T19:42:59+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"579781763\",\"name\":\"Paul Mock\"},{\"id\":\"635786642\",\"name\":\"David Hood\"},{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\"},{\"id\":\"1422975257\",\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\"},{\"id\":\"225017\",\"name\":\"Thomas Maiorana\"},{\"id\":\"696561163\",\"name\":\"Kathia Laszlo\"},{\"id\":\"1045338394\",\"name\":\"Lucie Newcomb\"},{\"id\":\"19301400\",\"name\":\"Milicent Johnson\"},{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\"},{\"id\":\"664888262\",\"name\":\"Flora Moon\"},{\"id\":\"4200992\",\"name\":\"Jenny Ryan\"},{\"id\":\"317775\",\"name\":\"Bal\u00e1zs Lazlo Karafi\u00e1th\"},{\"id\":\"1314985753\",\"name\":\"Jennifer Sertl\"},{\"id\":\"704660253\",\"name\":\"Bruce Randolph Tizes\"},{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\"},{\"id\":\"702645559\",\"name\":\"Warren Te Brugge\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzAyNjQ1NTU5\",\"before\":\"NjgyMzE1OTQ3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"264094120345016\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\",\"id\":\"1482404646\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson Excellent, I like the idea to continue our thinking in new social organizations.

My primary caution would be to remember that to draw on the 'best in nature' should include HUMAN nature. Bee colonies, invasive plants, the mating habits of bonobos or music-making elephants notwithstanding, the nonhuman living world doesn't offer great models for how we better design businesses to account for, celebrate, honor and encourage culture (aesthetics, creative expression, morals, spirituality), meaning, experience, the quest for knowledge and so on.

Hear first-hand from \\nKate Bunney, of Tamera community in Portugal, and Paxus of Twin Oaks in Virginia. Discover how alternative approaches to green living and sharing can change how we relate to one another, in so many ways. Together, we can learn from these unique models and deepen our connection to peaceful, sustainable community in our cohousing neighborhoods and group houses.\\n\\nPotluck dinner at 6, followed by talks\/slide shows (roughly 7 pm start) with long-time members of two of the world's foremost innovative intentional communities.\\nTamera Healing Biotope-1 is a \\ndeep ecology and \\nspiritually oriented community, an offshoot of the German ZEGG movement founders, now reviving a desert area of Portugal through \\n\\npermaculture design. The 200 residents work together to model a non-violent existence of people and between people and nature. Its main missions are education, creating a self-sufficient \\n\\nSolar Village, and global networking under the name of GRACE.\\n\\nKate will present a 'talk-shop' on \\nCreating Peace Models for a New Culture. She will cover an overview of Tamera as a research and demonstration site.. emphasizing the \\nglobal campus educational aspect of the project.\\nTwin Oaks Community, founded in Louisa County, \\n\\nVirginia (\\n\\nwhere the recent DC-area earthquake happened) in the 1960s, is the most successful and largest \\n\\nincome-sharing (\\n\\nsecular) community. Eightyresidents and numerous visitors live and work through a unique member planning system. Each works 45 hours a week at housecleaning, tofu-making, hammock knotting, cattle herding, attending meetings, gardening, cooking, and childcare among other community-valued contributions. It has been called a \\n\\nfeminist community because the work system includes child-rearing and domestic tasks with equal credit to other forms of work.\\n\\nLongtime member \\n\\nPaxus Calta has hitchhiked on sailboats across the Pacific, \\n\\ndanced atop Russian tanks before Yeltsin made it fashionable, \\n\\nsmuggled Tibetan monks across the Himalayas, worked on the North Slope of Alaska for a nasty oil company. He also worked on an ocean engineering project in Hawaii that laid power cable on the ocean floor and dispatched submarines. For 7 years he \\n\\nfought nuclear power plants in eastern Europe. He taught a class on \\n\\nhow to design revolutions at an alternative high school. He has been arrested for \\n\\ncrimes of conscience in 12 countries on three continents and is one of two dads of Willow Falcon Star born on Valentines Day 2002. He suffers from \\n\\nterminal immodesty and an \\n\\ninflamed funny bone. He has lived at Twin Oaks Community for 12 years.\\n\\nPaxus will speak about \\n\\nSharing Systems: At the center of intentional community life is the behavior of sharing, both socio-cultural things and material things (\\n\\nnot to mention shared lives). He will discuss Twin Oaks' different systems around \\n\\nsharing vehicles, clothes, bicycles and a single collectivebank account. He explores the ideas of flexible agreements, semi-permeable dual systems (\\n\\npublic\/personal), control points and more. He'll also share what's true and what's silly about the recent film \\n\\nWanderlust, which gently mocks a TO-style \\n\\npoly-friendly commune.

In some cases, it shouldn't even be possible for you to say to Company Y that you have an NDA with Company X, unless there is a conflict of interest. You can still be a double or triple agent, but that's at your own peril. I say sign it if you have a stake in it.\\n\\nIf I get something out of knowing it, then it could be worth it, i.e. if I am an employee or whatnot of said Company, being paid, etc.. I think it would otherwise be a criminal activity to try to get people to sign NDAs just to shut them up, or make them unable to share knowledge they had prior to the agreement.. without compensating them in some way.\\n\\nYou should definitely be compensated for sitting at the luncheon or whatnot, shouldn't you? Your extremely valuable time and undivided attention? Don't people pay for that stuff?\\n\\nIf someone is sharing secret knowledge with me, I hope it's because they are consulting me, in which case I might be the one to ask for a NDA just to protect myself from their secrets. It can go both ways.\\n\\nI only want information or data on a need-to-know basis. Otherwise I liken it to someone telling me their dreams and nightmares and whatnot, or their deep personal secrets from their shady or traumatic past.. I'm not a clinical psychologist, I can't help you with such problems, I'm not a priest, either, I don't take confessions..\\n\\nSo the premise I'm presently under is that if you want to divulge secrets to me, there'd better be a tradeoff for me.. Or else it's dangerous business.. I don't want to know any more secrets, I already have my own creations and inventions.. It's bad mojo, it's hard too to keep air-tight compartments between blocks of ideas and processes, insight, strategies, etc.\\n\\nAlso, the less limiting the better. Better to stipulate freedoms than limitations, at least I prefer that modus operandi. And don't be stupid, only tell me the absolute extreme minimum.. again, the need-to-know.. I don't care if the CEO has prostate cancer or the CIO is pregnant with your child.. It has to be knowledge I can DO SOMETHING with, too, TO HELP YOU.. I have to be able to help you, too, so if I sign an agreement, it has to say a great deal about the secret itself, not divulge it outright, but you need to sacrifice a minimum, I call that the good faith token.. Trust me with the minimum, if I want to know more, we sign an agreement, if not, then sayonara. No deal.\\n\\nIt's possible to operate without an NDA, but not if it's business, which implies there is a quid pro quo.. Like I said earlier, I believe it would be criminal for me to get a million people to sign an NDA that forbade them to talk about, say, at the extreme, something not even all that secret.. just to shut me up.. If you can pull that off and have good enough lawyers, maybe you can make a buck, a dirty one. It would be the equivalent of being a patent troll, call it an \\\"NDA troll\\\".. a dealer in secrets..\\n\\nIt's a HUGE Ethical question, though, one that is fundamental to Business, especially to any Innovation.. It is also a virtue, I think, the ability to never \\\"spill\\\" anything.. It takes character. I've noticed that most people I've come in contact with seem unable to keep secrets, and that for a business can mean the difference between profitability and bankruptcy, I've also seen that go down, and it was real nasty.\\n\\nI'm an artist and I try never to let other artists know what I'm actually presently working on. I can wait ten years before sharing something with the world.. It's a question of integrity, of the integrity of my work.. hard to put into words.

All cells get what they need to thrive, and those cells doing the most important jobs are \u201cpaid\u201d more. Some even are given a \u201cstaff\u201d of supporting cells.\\n    Excess \u201cwealth\u201d is stored in community \u201cbanks\u201d (i.e., fat cells) and gets allocated based on the needs of the whole system.\\n    There is no \u201cborrowing.\u201d The body gets to use only the energy available.\\n    There is no \u201cinflation.\u201d The value of ATP had remained stable for seven billion years!\\n    In regards to government, the cellular system embodies the official motto of the United States, e pluribus unum, out of many one. Each cell is \u201cfree\u201d to thrive, provided it contributes to the well being of the whole system.\\n    Divisive and dualistic politics is unknown in the body. Different polarities \u2013 like proteins and lipids \u2013 cooperate to create an integrated whole.\\n    Unlike the human mass media, our bodies rely on accurate information, unspun and undistorted, so that our protection systems can distinguish between real and imaginary threats. \u201cDialogue\u201d between individual cells and the body\u2019s central voice goes on all the time, and the \u201cgovernment\u201d listens and endeavors to do what is best for the whole system.\\n    In a cell \u2013 or for that matter a human body \u2013 growth and protection mechanisms are mutually exclusive. Growth is represented by moving toward a stimulus with \u201copen arms\u201d in order to assimilate and grow. In contrast, protection is moving away from a stimulus and closing down. While protection is sometimes necessary to defend one\u2019s life, protection behaviors use the system\u2019s energy but do not provide the system with energy for survival.\\n    Consequently, an organism that spends an inordinate amount of time in the protection posture is by definition undermining its health. There is a biological truth behind being \u201cscared to death.\u201d While protection is necessary, an \u201covermilitarized\u201d body is expressing a pathology called \u201cauto-immune dysfunction.\u201d\\n\\nSource: http:\/\/www.brucelipton.com\/spontaneous-evolution-questions-partial-answers\/\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13},{\"id\":\"665043478\",\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":175,\"length\":16}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T12:55:15+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262287937192301\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"id\":\"736739458\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson See this article on ecosystem approach to providing solutions rather than products: http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/cs\/2012\/03\/amazon_vs_apple_competing_ecos.html?awid=5848553668940239991-3271\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T14:29:51+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262292797191815\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jean Russell\",\"id\":\"736739458\"},\"message\":\"Daniel F.

The use of a biological structure or function for a purpose other than that for which it initially evolved. 2. An evolutionary process in which a given adaptation is first naturally selected for, and subsequently used by the organism for something other than its original, intended purpose. 3.

I figure purpose can be deducted from evolutionary history of features, but how do we distinguish purpose as intent from just using what is available?\\n\\nMark Roest's response:\\n\\nUsing what is available is the line of least resistance (the Way of the Tao) of manifestation of intent. It is not necessary to separate intent and purpose. When a being or a flock of beings has intent to live and tries various strategies in the face of a category of challenge, some as solely an internal selection process and some through experimentation (trial and error, play), any yielding to effort will be pursued. Learning continues, and if successful learners survive at a higher rate than non-learners, the characteristics that made them able to learn well, in the new direction, will expand in prevalence in the gene pool.\\n\\nWe know that life has the intention to live; play is largely about learning patterns of successful ways to surmount challenges, and play is ubiquitous in mammals. Non-mammalian life forms also show purpose and directed coordination in their behaviors. The entire process of evolution displays meta-intention, prima facie. That meta-intention may have aspects of pure system artifact, and of Universal Intelligence \u2013 and everything between.\\n\\nWe are writing about millions of parallel, interactive streams of evolution on a planet with hundreds of eco-regions and thousands of ecosystems, in a surface area of about 198 million square miles <http:\/\/wiki.answers.com\/Q\/What_is_the_area_in_square_miles_of_the_surface_of_the_earth_including_land_and_water>, over a 3 billion year time scale. There is clearly room for multiple meta-systems of adaptation, motivated and perhaps guided by infinitely varied forms of intention and consciousness, to occur in parallel and over time.\\n\\nIf we are open to the metaphysical, we can also see (or at least learn about and tune in to, for me so far) a whole systems perspective which is not in denial of the unseen. Said denial was necessary for the emergence and domination of European practical science and the Industrial Revolution, which provided the necessary logistical and military advantages to enable colonialism as a multinational policy of empire. However, all peoples have had deep connection with the unseen. The oral tradition of it goes back at least 40,000 years (Australian aborigine and Cherokee), per a storyteller initiated and trained in both traditions, whom I met at the Wittenberg Center for Alternative Resources in upstate New York.\\n\\nThe core of our best solution to the challenges that face humanity today is to recognize that these are the paramount facts of human existence, that we had evolved behaviors of sustainable harvest of surplus yields, and management for continued yields of complete ecosystems (stewardship), in most of the populated ecosystems on earth before the Agricultural Revolution, and that we can and need to systematically recover them.\\n\\nBy returning to sustainability in lifestyles, and universalizing social safety nets (all for one and one for all) across political and ethnic lines, we can live resiliently and, if we act quickly and decisively enough, radically reduce the threats facing us.\\n\\nLet us make it so.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T19:55:58+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262467027174392\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jim Rutt\",\"id\":\"575143366\"},\"message\":\"a lot of good stuff there Mark Roest:  however, this seems like a total non sequitur:\\n\\n\\\"If we are open to the metaphysical\\\"\\n\\nI don't see the need to resort to the metaphysical to explain either historical practices or to vastly improve our contemporary trajectories.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"100000592737021\",\"name\":\"Mark Roest\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":26,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T20:23:51+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262520130502415\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"message\":\"thank you all for the thoughtful responses so far, much to ponder - Jim - my sense is that the whole systems perspective has historically been viewed as a metaphysical or spiritual rather than a scientific perspective - look at the amount of crap thrown Lovelocks way for the Gaia hypothesis - however my sense is also that the scientific worldview has been transcending and including to bring such whole system perspectives into the realm of the acceptable, thanks in no small part to the work of the Sante Fe Institute, and the many other systems science organizations\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-21T21:56:35+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"262522860502142\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John F Powers\",\"id\":\"674516612\"},\"message\":\"I'm self-conscious about embarrassing myself among all the brainiacs here.

Thus with differing definitions and meanings for key terms: metaphysical, network and ecosystem. I contribute from my own biases.\\n\\nI see a confusion between concepts such as network, system, ecology to reference 1) conceptual frames we employ in our language discourse and 2) implication of objective existence for entities so named. This takes us to the distinction between process and existential ontolgies, a distinction that can be important in some discourses and not important in others.\\n\\nI have come to distinguish between four distinct conceptual frames: nets, systems, holarchies, ecologies.\\n \\n NETS are the most primitive of the structures - but can be very complex. They are characterized by nodes (which can have properties), links (which can have qualities), and temporal relations between nodes over links.\\n \\n SYSTEMS have a core net on which constraints on process give it agency\/identity and a character where \\\"the whole is more than the sum of the parts\\\".  General Systems Theorists tend to use the term \\\"system\\\" to apply to anything.  I prefer to limit the use of the term to one level - the system composed of components, relationships between components, subsystems (important to distinguish from components), and environments.  With this limited use, components and environments are viewed \\\"classically\\\" and not viewed themselves as systems (with the exception of considering the interaction between small sets of systems that share the same environment).\\n \\n HOLARCHIES (Koestler's terminology) are nested  holons, where each holon is a system in the sense above.  James Greer Miller in his opus, \\\"Living Systems\\\" identifies 19 common (structural) subsystems in holons from cell to global societies - with a similar holarchy from atom to cell not covered by Miller). Miller distinguished between \\\"nested hierarchies\\\" and \\\"echelon hierarchies\\\". I find the distinction between system and holarchy very important.\\n \\n ECOLOGY is still emerging in my conceptual scheme.  An ecology appears to be a mixture of nets, systems, and holarchies with the addition of a fractal-like character.  Also, in an ecology a node\/component in one holon my relate directly with a node\/component in another holon. Temporality is essential in comprehending ecologies.  There is an essential tension between a \\\"balance of nature\\\" and \\\"evolutionary\/emergent\\\" processes (occurring at all levels) challenging the balance. Mutual aide, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis must be considered in changes in ecologies.\\n \\nSimple ecologies can serve as conceptual frames for human dynamics.  There is an issue whether pure networks can have agency beyond the sum of agencies of the nodes.  I use the term \\\"sysnet\\\" for a large network where smaller systems emerge among subnets, where the systems can later dissolve and the nodes return to being but subnets.  Most digital entities are sysnets. We can mistake our intention of expectant agency of our networks, as we resist constraints (re threats to our \\\"individuality\\\") that would enable more systems with agency to emerge (and often enhance our own agency using the systems for leverage).\\n\\nThe issue re \\\"metaphysics\\\" relates to how versed one is in the checkered history of science (as a human process) and whether one functions in the ideology of physics and reductionism or are open to an emergent \\\"science\\\" - with the proviso of not jumping on each exception as an excuse to over generalize.  I recommend Steve Fuller's \\\"Social Epistemology\\\" as an introduction to the human side of \\\"science\\\".  Those who correctly point out flaws in conceptual systems are not always competent in proposing better alternative conceptual systems.

You might set certain bounds on game play that you think are boundaries, but then an \\\"emergent gameplay\\\" x might come out.. Without knowing what x is or might be, the \\\"actual\\\" game play after n number of periods, it's too risky to put actual values and adding that to the game dynamics.\\n\\nTake Empire Avenue as an example. It was designed to be a \\\"social game\\\" and I admit I had a lot of fun with it.. Until actual \\\"quants\\\" got into it and people are just using advanced policies to \\\"game\\\" the system.. and come out on top.. If there are ways to \\\"game\\\" it, someone will find that way.. it will be an \\\"emergent gameplay\\\" you never thought of or prepared for.. And when real value is built into the system, then everyone will lose except those who \\\"gamed\\\" the system.. so you will have a majority of very unhappy players.. who lost value by playing this game, or stayed stagnant..\\n\\nIt's a little more complex than that, but right off the top of my head, that's my answer.. Play the game first for n number of periods and optimize the game through iterations.. to get to a spot you think is optimal and you've accommodated for \\\"emergent\\\" patterns.. Then when it's solid and people have been playing for a while.. add the alternative currency part.. if and only iff the system is \\\"safe\\\".. but you can't predict every possibility..\\n\\nSo in the first n number of periods, you might give people incentives to \\\"game\\\" the system.. an incentive to find emergent gameplay.. That you can put a real value on, because they're helping you fix the game.. make it fair, etc. But otherwise I might join your community NOT for the purposes of being in optimal health, but to amass a \\\"fund\\\" instead..\\n\\nOnce I have a \\\"fund\\\" I can buy off other players' actions.. I can say, \\\"Do this and I will give you 1000 alt-coins..\\\" I can do it on some other channel, outside your game, and you might not even be privy to our interactions..\\n\\nIn any case, this is the perfect place to post about you Serious Game.. I've followed many a conversation here on trustnets and what have you.. There are veritable experts in the matter here.. I'm looking forward to the ensuing conversation. :)\\n\\nThere are no perfect games, except maybe in a mathematician's mind.. But knowing a lot about the human psyche and its mechanics, as you do, you should be able to \\\"predict\\\" what some of the more \\\"problematic\\\" equilibrium states might be in your system.. I can name a few \\\"problem states\\\" that humans are really good at, an example is preferential attachment.. or the rich get richer.. It's going to be hard to make the game fair for everybody, and not favor a certain person p.. maybe someone with a larger network with more edges.. by playing the game, maybe person p1 who already is a \\\"hub\\\" node, p1 may get more new edges\/links\/connections that me, p2 with a smaller network with fewer edges\/links..\\n\\nThere are ways to normalize gameplay, I think, by making explicit contractual agreements with penalties, that is, enforceable explicit contracts.. What I'm assuming you'd want is positive externalities, you'd probably want people who play the game to get healthier, etc., or otherwise \\\"progress\\\", i.e. all players as an extended group\/network.. I don't know I think this kind of game is really difficult to design.. I hope Curatr has thought long and hard about this and has employed some top-notch mathematicians..\\n\\nI worry about what is often used as \\\"points\\\" either reputation points for good actions, or losing points for bad actions.. It often doesn't do anything to make messages credible.. You can add a handicap though, make credible messages, i.e. honest signals, COSTLY.. Maybe Curatr thought about that already.. But even then, credibility points can be gamed.. it's going to be hard to evaluate players' strategies properly, especially if there are real-life rewards OUTSIDE of the game..

While COLLAPSE remains a viable metaphor for longer term future scenarios as well as apt descriptor for what is happening in some regions, it may be masking more apt metaphors for what emergents face in the present and near future.  This was my situation until recently shifted while reading Arundhati Roy's latest superb essay: \\\"Capitalism: A Ghost Story\\\".  IMHO this long essay is an essential read.\\nhttp:\/\/www.informationclearinghouse.info\/article30877.htm\\n\\nBeginning with a review of \\\"Gush-Up\\\" in India's shift to global capitalist tyranny (blowing away the myth of a Gandhian peaceful India), giving me a view of India potentially as dangerous as US imperialism, Roy romps through an excellent but concise history of the rise of global capitalism and an excellent expose of how corporate philanthropy gains support of the middle class and professional elites.  Although these scenarios forecast genocidal actions on large human populations and severe attacks on our biosphere, they call forth metaphors of transition, not collapse; of brutal oppression, not passive acceptance.\\n\\nAlthough longer term scenarios may involve an eventual collapse of global corporatism (or whatever we come to call this new process ALSO EMERGING among the power hungry elites), the societal environments with which OUR EMERGENCE encounters may not be one with opportunities appearing during collapse.  We need to re-examine our metamorphic metaphor for emergence. In biological metamorphosis the caterpillar is passive in a cocoon, dissolving into a nutrient soup for the emerging imaginal buds. Our societal caterpillar is far from passive. It is moving full steam ahead becoming a more powerful caterpillar, increasing dangerous to Gaia and to the vitality of our emergent societal imaginal buds.\\n\\nI sense the dominant attitude among fellow emergents is to focus almost exclusively on augmenting our own emergence and to assume the metaphor of collapse because (rightly, IMHO) there is nothing we can do to directly influence the game of the elites.  While I fully agree that our primary focus must be our own emergence I fear it is dangerous to assume a passive attitude to our societal environment.  Not that we engage it in vain hopes we can significantly transform it, but that our strategies must take into account this reality and that we explore endgame strategies and what actions we must be taking now so that we can have greater influence on the resultant endgame.\\n\\nMy concern is that we lack a \\\"discourse process\\\" and \\\"platforms\\\" adequate for successful, continuing \\\"dialog-to-action\\\" on an issue of such magnitude, complexity, and security concerns.  I use quotes because I believe that we currently lack appropriate metaphors for our need. On reflection about ongoing interaction on \\\"big pictures\\\" I sense endless jabber (but often of high quality at this level).  We can only begin using what we have; but we must be critically aware that something is missing and work towards creating the \\\"technology\\\" we need for successful, long-term metamorphosis in the face of a societal caterpillar that is not cooperative and not resigned to metamorphosis.\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQA-CwGpfx202TGZ&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informationclearinghouse.info%2Fantalia_20120326.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.informationclearinghouse.info\/article30877.htm\",\"name\":\"Arundhati Roy :  Capitalism: A Ghost Story    :   Information Clearing House\",\"caption\":\"www.informationclearinghouse.info\",\"description\":\"Capitalism: A Ghost Story  \\t\\t\\tRockefeller to Mandela, Vedanta to Anna Hazare....

What media\/platform is minimally necessary for the types of dialog-to-action needed has been one of my challenges since I started using computers & cyberspace in 1982. Tools for my composition\/dialog needs are not yet available - primarily because few recognize the need for the type of dialog-to-action I envision we need.\\n\\nVUE, Visual Understanding Environment, has some aspects needed, like multiple types of links. But I have never learned to use VUE as it is too slow for draft composing from mind-bursts and too labor intensive for edited composing, and it is unlikely to have few users. Also, I am not aware of dialog features or what alternatives are available.  From the beginning I have needed an integrated Outliner & Hypertext system - but I've not found anyone who also has that need.  I view outlines as specific routes in webs. The system would be nested and networked. That Wiki can simulate an outline is not adequate.  When I compose I create\/navigate a fractal-like web - digging deeper and deeper, citing conditions & implications, then bounding back to meta and meta-meta levels.  Recommended reading would be to first read all the top level items, then deeper and deeper levels.  Making deeper outline levels Wiki links (with no hint of what the link is) is inadequate.  When polishing an outline composition various other hyperlink references can be added - to be distinguished from outline levels.  My earlier attempts to cobble an experimental system, using protocols, failed as I was unable to interest others - and it needed to be a collaborative effort for potential users.  I speculate that without such as system certain necessary types of nested-networked conceptual schemes can't emerge in populations. Returning to VUE, a visual presentation and use of diagrams and multimedia are important; but I would be satisfied with a system that enabled others to expand & collapse an outline and have hypertext links.  Currently I do most of my composing in an outliner NoteMap (for lawyers from LexisNexis), but the nested character is essentially eliminated in posting onine. Outliners in wordprocessors are an afterthought and inadequate.\\n\\nAnother requirement IMHO is the ability to respond to a point in a display. Years ago The Foresight Institute experimented with such a system, but it gained no traction. The Foresight instittue was the only place, to my knowledge, that saw the need for hypertext composing and communicating technologies beyond the display format of Wikipedia. For years I did my composing in hypertext until I discovered no one reads hypertext documents (to my knowledge). I occassionally used QuickTopic and QuickDoc.  QuickDoc permits you to format a WORD doc so that readers can comment on any place you might designate - the easy version being at the end of each paragraph.  QuickDoc enables multiple users to dialog with each other over single paragraphs. If a comment becomes long and itself needs multiple points for comment\/dialog a linked QuickDoc can be made for that comment. Due to my inability to sustain dialog with QuickDoc I have not learned some of the new features, such as including photos.\\n\\nMy 2 months here on TheNextEdge is my first real encounter with popular social media and Facebook.

Workers (persons and teams) in a SEAF network fall into two rough categories. 1) those who relate to persons and teams to help determine their both internal and external needs, as well as to inform them of potentials they may not be aware of; and 2) those working in vast networks of connectivity that provide the information needed by the first group.  SEAF networks can be envisioned as an enzymatic factor in social change, both permitting and accelerating social change far beyond what was possible without SEAF networks.

Simply posting a seed in cyberspace almost dooms the creation, no matter how extraordinary, to - at best - a dedicated, but relatively closed group of supporters.\\n\\nI speculate that the creators of seeds generally are unable to create the required soils and scaffolding, each which will involve their own technologies.

Currently automobiles are deliberately designed to fail within a few years, and in which repairs and parts are both expensive and difficult to repair\/replace. This planned obsolescence is a deliberate design flaw for maximizing auto industry\/auto mechanic profit margins.\\n\\n2) Increase use and value of existing materials from failed products from the old economy. There are vast stores of raw materials in everyone's home town in the name of land fills. Additionally there are the already burgeoning materials from people's junk. If new products can be made from the old, but which last a lifetime, there a radical reduction in the requirement of new materials from far away places.\\n\\n3) Unless the larger cartels completely corner the market on raw materials through some kind of global embargo against the masses, those materials will continue to leak out into the larger economy through every other \\\"allowed\\\" product on the market. Can we honestly expect that steel will become an outlawed commodity? If steel ends up in localized markets, it's only a matter of time before localized means of production converts that steal from planned obsolescent products into long-lasting sustainable ones.\\n\\n4) Continued advancement of sustainable materials - from bioplastics, to biocomposities. Carbon materials are advancing rapidly. Since carbon is everywhere, the future material supply chain will in turn become more localized.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-27T21:22:00+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MjY2MTA5NDk2ODEwMTQ1\",\"before\":\"MjYzMTI4OTU3MTA4MTk5\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_266098733477888\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"id\":\"652503168\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.shareable.net\/blog\/noisebridge-node-emergent-global-hackerspace-network\",\"name\":\"Shareable: Noisebridge: Design Patterns for Productive Chaos\",\"caption\":\"www.shareable.net\",\"description\":\"It's a Tuesday night at Noisebridge, and the place is a mess.

Today he launched a kickstarter campaign (http:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/markoslavnic\/all-that-remains-feature-film) for something more ambitious: \\\"When I started this film I knew it was a very ambitious project, but at the same time this was a story that I couldn't walk away from. The war in Bosnia has in many ways defined me, my life, and my whole existence, and as a filmmaker I feel like this is a story that I had to tell...All That Remains is a feature film written and directed by Marko Slavnic. The film is about two brothers, Tarik and Mirza, who came to the States with their family as kids in order to escape the war in Bosnia. While they were able to evade direct physical danger, the war still took a heavy toll on the family, especially the father...Now in their mid-20's the estranged brothers are brought back together when their father unexpectedly dies and leaves a letter asking them to go and scatter his ashes back home...This film isn't just about Bosnia. It's about family, about regret, about the loss of identity, and about father-son relationships. But most of all it is about the destructive power of war and the way it affects people whether they are Bosnian, Syrian, Iraqi, American, or any other nationality.\\n\\nThis film is a reminder that war doesn't just end with the last shot or a peace treaty.

It is a query, a never-to-end process of discovery AND creativity; for in exploration we emerge and become more than we were.\\n\\nIt is often claimed that the human brain is the most complex system in the known universe. This claim has many qualifications, such as that the system must be one of contiguous matter, otherwise the solar system or Gaia (containing brains) would be more complex. Whether a star or a brain is more complex would probably hinge on our definition of complexity.  This metaphorical claim is useful for me in considering education as the most complex and most difficult enterprise for humankind: systematically augmenting changes in this most complex system, the human brain. Yet, humans approach education as a far less difficult or important enterprise than many others.  I'll return to this issue after we boost our query up a notch.\\n\\nI claim that a temporally extended network of interacting human brains is a far more complex system than an individual human brain. And not just because it is composed of many brains. This speculation will take us out of many boxes. What is of interest here is not primarily the biological\/molecular web of neurons, synapses and the ultra complex processes of the entire neural system in intimate interaction with the whole body. What is of interest is the patterns of interaction within this system from the moment it turns on in embryo to the patterns as the system dies.\\n\\nI propose the dominant function of this brain-in-body is WORLDWEAVING. Worldweaving  autopoetically processes ongoing sensoria stimulation weaving an emergent pattern (called a \\\"world\\\") throughout the life of the organism. This world is \\\"constructed\\\", but not by conscious or intentional direction (although both are component processes within emergence). Survival (continued emergence) employs processes contemporary psychology call conditioning-to-environmental-stimuli and other higher level processes. The maintenance of the whole pattern of the accumulated woven world (including the metaphor, memory) is an essential task of worldweaving.  Conventional models have the brain (with the help of memory) modulating input to generate output (behavior & experientials) - the S\/R metaphor.  We reverse this model here: sensoria stimulation modulates whole world processes leading to the \\\"emission\\\" of behavior and experientials.  Actually both models are useful at different times. For \\\"advanced\\\" humans, where earlier survival skills are less important and with technology, the creative, internal initiated activity of this emergent world\/self becomes dominant.\\n\\nAll the above was about one human.  In autopoietic theory organisms don't communicate, they don't exchange information. Instead, they structurally couple.  We need not be concerned about the difference here because Maturana and Varela proved (using  The Laws of Form by George Spencer-Brown) that communication and structural coupling were logically equivalent.  However, as we move forward, structural coupling may be a more useful model\/metaphor than communication.\\n\\nToday our cultures are dominated by the myth of individuality.  We, each of us, experience our world containing our self as the primary decider of \\\"who we are\\\". This is an illusion.  We are \\\"who we are\\\" by a confluence of many factors -- ALL our sensoria fields over our lifetime interacting with the unique configuration of our specific, inherited body\/neural system.  Our woven worlds are heavily culturally laden. Even as young adults we cannot change that we are a node in a temporal web that stretches back to our birth. The \\\"self\\\" is itself a construction of our worldweaving process,  a propensity built into our inheritance via evolution and now having troublesome implications.\\n\\nOur experientials (as our behaviors) have been conditioned to view our \\\"selves\\\" as within an objective world which we sense - as this is a highly functional model - consistent with the woven worlds of other organisms.  But, what the web of humans on Earth have done is to force an emergency emergence of global world woven humanity in intimate structural coupling with Gaia (of which we are also part).\\n\\nWe are each woven worlds, structurally coupling.  We exchange SEMS (semiotic structures). We interact with a Semiotic World (cyberspace+).\\n\\nHumans evolved as social beings from when we were as prairie dogs; it is not a recent invention. Mammal brains are specialized for socialization and communication (structural coupling, at later stages).  Languaging (a process a la Maturana), now amplified by technology has kicked human emergence into a dimension\/domain beyond the \\\"biologically natural\\\".  [Which is why the \\\"evolution\\\" metaphor is so inappropriate.]\\n\\nI will refrain from further speculations at this time - postponed until later.  I come back to EDUCATION as the most challenging and difficult task. Now, we must imagine \\\"education\\\" to apply to the emergent network of structurally coupled woven worlds.  My own emergent woven world, which I call \\\"nuet\\\", has been working on this challenge for 4-5 decades. My current model\/scenario I call UPLIFT, with the practical objective of \\\"rapidly uplifting the distribution of cognitive competencies of all human populations in humankind\\\".\\n\\nI need to end this SEM at this point, but the process has only been initiated. I need assistance in constructing a platform where this \\\"issue\\\" can emerge with vitality and commitment.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/263115103776251\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/263115103776251\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-22T22:06:42+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-25T02:57:20+0000\",\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"264235180330910\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Larry Victor\",\"id\":\"1224823408\"},\"message\":\"PLEASE READ.

I'd be interested in knowing what other creators of \\\"visual art\\\" think about Pinterest. It seems to me that it's a question of personal preferences. I know someone who has been a visual artist for 50+ years and he doesn't care if you share his art digitally. He sees it as free publicity. He doesn't mind if you download a digital copy of his art either, cause he saw that coming and didn't publish a good enough version, so that you can't really print his art work and frame it (a resolution thingie). If you downloaded it though and published it on your website and didn't give any attribution, then he'd be pissed, but he still wouldn't take any action other than kindly ask you to either take it down or link to his website or give correct attribution. So it seems that for the most part, Pinterest just has to make attribution easier for people.. Maybe what the web needs - and Maria Popova's recent The Curator's Code idea might be a step in that direction - is that we need to be able to get attribution metadata with just ONE CLICK of the mouse.. So that if the original image had all proper metadata fields filled out.. using a standard of course.. then when you PIN the image, it would fill in the fields on Pinterest.. This would save I'd save 75% of any future problems, cause most visual artists that I've talked to about this, wouldn't mind if you \\\"pinned\\\" their image.. so long as you attributed it..

Here's something that I've been listening to recently, that many of you may find HUGELY helpful in your work. \\n\\nA disclaimer: please trust me. I know what it looks like, and I had the same reaction, but I urge you to overlook it.  I refuse to let the horrible, horrible advertising\/aesthetics\/snakeoil salesman thing that is, as I think I've said before, so inherent in so much of \\\"self-help\\\" culture, for lack of a better word, and skip ahead to some of these replay teachings. \\n\\nWhat really resonated with me, as I listened today to a chakra clearing, (and why I chose, after months of using this without posting it, to share it today) was the request in this session that users acknowledge and take a second to accelerate the potential power of shared, focused, energetic INTENTION, and invite others to participate. And I realised that even if my audience\/network didn't listen or click, that by sharing I would create a momentary shift via asking others to consider the potential power of a vast, connected energetic practice {this is being done also by the Global Coherence Initiative, which some of us have pointed to previously: http:\/\/www.glcoherence.org\/ ]\\n\\nIt's crucial to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff where this sort of information is concerned -- so many healers and teachers have simply taught themselves the languages of this time and place, and thereby the ones of us who try to stay away from \\\"selling\\\" are turned off by it. \\n\\nBy allowing myself to see past that language and feel the essence, and the energy\/intention behind this work, and in particular acknowledging the value of the huge number of practitioners gathered here, I feel it is right to share it with you -- that I must, in fact, share with you this resource. Here's some of the language they put forth, and the link. I'd be happy to tell you what replays have been most useful for me.

It is the combined functions of our jurisprudential and governmental systems as influenced by our media, education, economic and social systems.  These both generate and synthesize judgements about morality and epistemology: what is good and what is true.  They then plug-in to executive functions to implement on their judgements based on methodologies that were designed by and are constrained by the same ethical algorithms that implement them.  The idea of a \\\"right to an attorney\\\" or a \\\"judicial appeal\\\" or \\\"habeas corpus\\\" or \\\"a warrant\\\" are all parts of the algorithm - designed to check known failure conditions in the system.  \\n\\nIt is not a matter of whether to have an ethical algorithm or an execution function - it is a matter of what and how.  There are currently many, many operating ethical algorithms that are plugged into execution functions that are capable of deadly force.  These include \\\"relatively\\\" Ethical ones like those operated in Western National structures (massive scare quotes here) as well as those operated in increasingly failed states down to non-governmental actors like Mafias or Cartels and even the LRA itself.  \\n\\nOf particular interest to me on watching the Kony agon was that in the end if it is decided that Kony needs to be removed, the *only* extant mechanisms are appeals (similar to the Kony 2012) campaign to existing ethical algorithms like the US government or the Ugandan military to deploy the policing functions that they control.  This fact gives rise to the use of propagada and control tactics designed to manipulate existing ethical algorithms (i.e, influence politicians and dictators) to achieve desired goals - a result both blunt in capability and unEthical in its inevitable consequence of obliterating any sense of the Truth (as we current see in the Kony situation).  \\n\\nMy discovery is that we, in fact, can construct a policing function that is appropriate to the emerging ethical networks - one that can be entirely independent of legacy ethical algorithms.

I thought this was the most important point the author made:\\n\\\"[Through KONY 2012] Uganda is largely just the stage for a debate over the meaning of political activism in the US today.\\\"\\n\\nThere's two basic threads through this whole case and the discussion here: \\n1) IC have chosen a peculiarly reductive and unhelpful narrative, their motives appear cloudy, and their suggested solutions ignore the agency of people on the ground, as well as potentially doing nothing for them. This has mostly been proven and there's not too much to be learned by arguing over it or rehashing the data. \\n2) IC have demonstrated how to mobilize a lot of people quickly in way that has interesting implications for people trying to do the same\\n\\nI'm left with two questions:\\n\\n1) Rather than reject the whole exercise out of hand, is there an alternative narrative around making Kony infamous that would be helpful that they could have put out, to similar effect? One that allowed for more on the ground agency, recognized that a military option, let alone a Ugandan-army only military option was not the only or objectively best option, and had a more tangible promise of long-term benefit. Is there someone in the Kony 2012 critics camp who wants to try to do that? Could IC pivot in that direction themselves, thereby retaining the energy they've tapped while recognizing their errors?\\n\\n2) Is the secret to why they got so many people motivated so quickly in the reductiveness of the \\\"see the world as a four year old\\\", America can save the day narrative*? If that's the case then activist groups with more integrity have little they can learn except that there's short-term attention value in that kind of narrative, even if it means betraying their principles? Or is there a way of communicating more nuanced and more accurate narratives about important issues that, in today's rich media environment, could have just as much impact, without making the same mistakes?\\n\\n*And the unbelievable cuteness of the little blond kid ;-)\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Curtis\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":27,\"length\":6}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-13T20:46:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"257696854318076\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"id\":\"665043478\"},\"message\":\"Michael Costigan - I hate to always be playing the bad-guy role, but don't forget 3) the degree to which this particular model provides examples for \\\"activism jamming\\\" for those who want to do so.

Classic NGOs still operate much like other industrial institutions, such as the corporation and the market state, as they believe that resources need to marshalled and managed. By contrast, the new for-benefits have only an active role in enabling and empowering the community to co-operate - by provisioning its infrastructure, not by commanding its production processes. These associations exist for the sole purpose of benefitting the community of which they are the expression. This is good news, as they are generally managed in democratic ways. And they have to be, because an undemocratic institution would discourage contributions by the community of participants.\\n\\nHere is the kicker.

And they find their place inside those conditions.\\n\\nYou can see a bit more about what that looks like (and the reason it is effective) in this TEDx talk http:\/\/tedxtalks.ted.com\/video\/TEDxTucson-Hildy-Gottlieb-Creat  I hope this is helpful.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"564335368\",\"name\":\"Fernanda\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":8}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-13T16:09:00+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"257739847647110\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jim McCarthy\",\"id\":\"745200944\"},\"message\":\"Often, maybe even usually, one needs primarily to be heard.

Rosenberg, was mentioned. It is very effective. It is an actually formalized way to engage in dialogue, which was also mentioned. I would also recommend the book The Conflict Resolution Toolbox by Gary T. Furlong. It's just a must-have, it has numerous excellent methods. It really depends on what kind of conflict you are facing. Different methods work differently for different kinds of conflict.\\n\\nWhat I have found, like with NVC, is at first when I started using it, it felt kind of \\\"mechanical\\\". I felt bad using a \\\"technique\\\", especially with relationships with actual people, I felt \\\"cheap\\\" somehow.. and it felt mechanical and forced.. But once I saw how powerful the methods were at resolving even the most difficult conflicts, I didn't care anymore how it felt, cause it was exquisite and soothing! :)\\n\\nYou mention one team wanting to \\\"clear the energy space\\\".. I'm assuming there is a lot of hurt. It also seems there is a decision-making process involved, i.e. some agreement is to be reached. There are numerous negotiation techniques, of the win-win style. My own experience, though, with relationships where there was a lot of hurt, i.e. violence, abuse, distrust, etc.. tells me.. What does it tell me? I don't know.. I guess that no trauma is unsurpassable.. Trust is easily lost and hard to gain back, but it can always be gained back, it just takes time, and all parties involved have to be willing to do the work.. the \\\"emotional labor\\\" as Seth Godin calls it.\\n\\nYou might have to adapt the methods, though, depending on the nature of the problem, which is probably something profound, I would imagine. How pressing is this, by the way? You might not have time to learn new methods, though, in which case my advice would be to find someone who can help guide you through whichever method.\\n\\nSorry this is so long-winded, but there is another book that honestly changed my life and helped me through something that seemed impossible. The book is Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames by Thich Nhat Hanh. This book is a quick read and the wisdom is terribly ancient. There was another book, I can't seem to find it, it was in French, called La Haine, but was probably a translation. It helped explain the sort of evolutionary and biological roots of hatred.. That really helped me through it..\\n\\nIn conclusion, Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross has some great books on grief. Methods of grief counseling can work in tough situations like these. Those hurt feelings, grief is what it is, often. I learned from experience that beneath anger and hatred is: sadness, sorrow, and grief.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-15T19:28:31+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"258854047535690\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Alex Lavigne-Gagnon\",\"id\":\"1341377803\"},\"message\":\"Active or empathic listening, was that mentioned?\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-15T19:29:59+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"260880453999716\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ferananda Ibarra\",\"id\":\"564335368\"},\"message\":\"Generative dialogue was mentioned. thus it requires for more than empathic listening.

Holacracy allows us complete sovereignty and autonomy to use our gifts as individuals, and holds a space where we can show up together to birth a new entity (the organization) and help it express its purpose in life.  It's deeply embracing and integrative of both human and organization, just takes a non-intuitive path to get there - but one very familiar to any parent who has had to learn that a healthy relationship with their children means differentiating and letting them be their own entity and express their own path in life.Helene and Fernanda, there's a much more detailed comparison of Sociocracy and Holacracy in our community of practice, including another more in-depth and specific video, many forum posts, a chart, and some lively debate.

As a parent with very good intentions, I've tried altruistically to serve the needs of my children without fully considering my own and without putting any expectations on them.  And I ended up resenting them tremendously. It was terrible, for them and for me.  In my experience, the parent-child relationship is more healthy, fulfilling and productive when there's open acknowledgement that we exist to serve and support each other. I need respect from my children. I need them to be quiet sometimes so I can recharge.  I need compromise and communication.  I need to honor my own values, even when some other mom's values seem much more fun to them. And I see a need for this same dynamic in organizations. Yes, we who work in an organization are its stewards.  But we can't forsake our own needs completely if it is to be a healthy and lasting relationship. This spirit of appropriate exchange is what I'm looking for in Holocracy.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1816501767\",\"name\":\"Brian\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":6,\"length\":5}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-22T16:18:45+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"223646814389747\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\",\"id\":\"520685736\"},\"message\":\"Michelle Holliday <big thumbs up> on the balance.

And I for one don't see any value in dismissing the individual, and would be concerned about that too if I saw it happening; though I know my languaging around differentiating individual and organization can sound like it, though that's not the intent at all - differentiation is a natural process which makes room for a much deeper conscious integration that honors the autonomy and individuality of both parties, and that's what I seek and what I've experienced Holacracy evoking.\\n\\nWhat you describe as desirable matches my experience of living in a Holacracy-powered organization quite well; I feel like I'm in an adult-to-adult relationship with the organization with mutually-honored boundaries.  It creates a space which pulls me to own my autonomy and individuality, and all of the talents and energy I choose to direct towards the organization\u2019s purpose are harnessed and integrated, without in any way limiting my own choice-making on what to give and what not, or calling me to give up self and my own goals and path for other; this is what I mean by an adult-to-adult relationship beyond co-dependence.  And, even on a bad day when I might want to dominate others, I can\u2019t \u2013 the organization isn\u2019t resting on me as a heroic leader.  In a legally Holacracy-powered organization like HolacracyOne, there are legally no owners controlling the organization, no \u201cmanagers\u201d directing others, and no employees for them to dominate or oppress anyway - just partners with the same fundamental rights as I have.\\n\\nAll of my experience and esoteric principles aside though, at its core Holacracy is just a power structure \u2013 just a set of rules about defining who has the authority and responsibility to do what, all encoded in a Constitution (available on www.holacracy.org).  It's not a decision-making process, not a philosophy, and not a facilitation style - just a set of \\\"rules of the game\\\", which can be used by an organization wishing to move the root of power from owners and heroic leaders to a purpose and a process of continually organizing around that purpose, by integrating whatever is sensed about the purpose through the consciousness of all the humans who choose to participate in expressing the purpose.  And, as one of our clients recently said: The really cool thing about Holacracy is that the process includes a way to change the process, so if someone finds a better way to do things, the process integrates that as well.  The Constitution defines Holacracy, not me \u2013 everything I might say about it is really all just talk, and just from my limited experience and perspective.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":8}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-22T19:00:20+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"223752771045818\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Brian Robertson\",\"id\":\"1816501767\"},\"message\":\"If you'd like to see how one of Holacracy's processes embraces us humans while still holding boundaries and ensuring healthy differentiation, check out the video of a Governance Meeting Simulation on our website (http:\/\/bit.ly\/xWC1Je).

It is however a governance system for a purpose-driven organization which has work to do in the world, not for a community - this is a key distinction the method forces.  Holacracy is governing an organization (not a group of people), for the sake of best expressing its purpose (although many communities have connected organizations which may be governed by Holacracy).

A tool for creating a distributed network, where ownership of content stays in the author's hands and revenues are distributed in reflection to the part people play, The Citizen Media invites micro-pledges on authors creating content. i.e. crowdsourcing. Micro-pledges are made by posting Message Ads. Right now I'm focused on our partnership with international changemaker www.ideorg.org. It's focused on bridging the digital divide and empowering financial independence for world's rural poor. We're busy applying for a grant for Knights News Network Competition. I'm excited about the potential here. These guys have already helped more than 19 million lives. If p2pfoundation uses the same platform, they'll be able to interconnect (further 'bridging the gap') and mutually benefit from customizations developed through each network. Here's a link to the overview I'm developing on CM's site: http:\/\/thecitizensmedia.com\/pub\/section\/connecting-the-worlds-poor?id=909. Kickstarter would indeed be a great way to fund the development of a customized site that directly meets p2pfoundation.net needs. If this peaks your interest, Michel Bauwens, would be more than happy to further discuss and share ideas. Our vision at CM is explained here: http:\/\/thecitizensmedia.com\/pub\/section\/why-we-built-it?id=902. The idea is to turn it into a true co-op. Here's how. 5% revenues generated through Message Ads go to CM  for research and development costs. This 5% 'contribution' will equate to the networks share of the co-op. Everyone owns it. No white elephants! At risk of linking you out (?!) here's one explaining the platform: http:\/\/thecitizensmedia.com\/pub\/section\/networks-explained?id=886.

Liz, to be clear, I agree that being audacious is a natural way to respond to extraordinary challenges. However, the very first step before this is what I am most concerned about. First, we have to reject the notion that everything will be \\\"just fine\\\", using the paradigms of yesterday and today, and basking in our excellence as confidence to overcome all. Second, we have to fully acknowledge that we have brought about some serious damage that cannot be patched over anytime soon. Humbleness, humility, whatever the term, refers for me to the idea that we cannot possibly adapt the attitude of the gentleman in the TED talk and at a time like this call out \\\"abundance\\\" - because this breeds complacency and the much desired \\\"phew\\\" moment. This prevents action\/engagement that you seek. Hence, we DO need humility in recognizing our place, but moreover, it is about recognizing that we fundamentally CANNOT have our cake and eat it. Somewhere, we will have to get used to a new measure of modesty of \\\"quality\\\" of life to match our commitment to the sacrifices that lie ahead. So bravery is fine, as long as you do not mean by this bravery to defend our way of life TODAY (crazy consumption and unsustainable industrial practices). That's not worth defending for me, frankly. Bravery and humility are about being open to the possibility that we can do with less, that we are okay giving up some things in the process, and that while innovation will be part of the equation, one other big part may be simply pragmatically \\\"sucking it up\\\" and dealing with the effects of the damage we will bring upon us. Ideally, we could be motivated for the \\\"right\\\" and kind reasons that Bernie DeKoven outlined.

The only real solution to this is to address the underlying culture of consumption that\u2019s linked to free market economics.\\\"\",\"caption\":\"Attachment UnavailableThis attachment may have been removed or the person who shared it may not have permission to share it with you.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/258985937522501\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/258985937522501\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-15T23:29:11+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-16T00:15:05+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"1422975257\",\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTQyMjk3NTI1Nw==\",\"before\":\"MTQyMjk3NTI1Nw==\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"258990524188709\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\",\"id\":\"1422975257\"},\"message\":\"Well put.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-15T23:38:07+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"258996020854826\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michael Costigan\",\"id\":\"796435084\"},\"message\":\"Napier Collyns points me to an article from the New Yorker last year on the same topic.

While it's easy to convince ourselves that collaboration will offer a better way, collaboration is not easy - maybe because there is so much we just don't yet know about how to collaborate effectively. I think it's important not to overstate collaborative approaches as a potential panacea to the world's challenges, but to understand that collaborative activity is a strategy choice, and it's not always the right strategy choice for achieving the impact you're seeking to make. It's also a set of skills and practices that sometimes don't come naturally, but which can be learned. All that said, collaboration is only useful when more can be achieved as a group than individually (whether we're talking about people or organizations), and I don't know that's always the case when it comes to mobilizing concrete action for change.  \\n\\nIn my experience and observation, the richest and most concretely productive collaborations seem to happen when people know each other well enough to be confident in what they can count on from each other, which implies long lead-ins in relationship building time and relatively open expectations from the outset. Scaled collaboration between larger, less tightly knit groups work best with a co-creative approach to a centrally coordinated output, where each unit in a group is responsible for the content of their own piece of work that's contributed to the whole. An article in a co-created book. A burning man installation. Pics from your home movie screening. \\n\\nCollaborative decision making on content and process, however, can tend to get bogged down in endless conversation and conflict when the  group is larger than 5-6 people and doesn't have an established level of trust and intimacy. Professional facilitation can help keep things moving for larger groups, but funding for a group of typically under-resourced social enterprises to talk about what they want to achieve together is very a hard sell - funders want to fund outputs, but collaborative innovation for maximizing impact needs open ended expectations to be meaningful. (By the way, the Stanford Innovation Review has published some interesting work on this). \\n\\nA related area I'm dreaming about as a result of this exploration is how we can collaboratively nurture the collective social impact of individuals or organizations who are part of a self-defined group. Might we find ways to increase and measure our collective impact on each other's work?

That beings to mind a comment made by \\\"Euroflycars\\\" on my recent article on money. He said:\\n\\n\\\"My comment of Feb 23, 2012, to Sepp Hasslberger's article \\\"Occupy economy - the case for soft money\\\"\\n\\nAs far as I know. Ying and Yang correspond to the fundamental duality of nature -- hence, I don't see how one of these two poles could be abolished. Much the same skepticism applies to those who want women to outnumber men in top positions: the really outperforming leaders we badly need are likely to be couples...\\n\\nHence, we need a balance between hard and soft money -- yet this balance is not so much a fundamental prerequisit as it is a resultant of a more fundamental balance in societal organization, i.e. the balance between the sedentary and the mobile elements of society.\\n\\nThis balance, known in Nature as symbiosis, is what ensures the perennity of all livestock -- not predation (as the current tenants of power tend to make us believe through movies like The Lion King, The Chronicles of Narnia, or Dysney's latest documentary African cats), which is at best an epiphenomen of evolution, and at worst sheer parasitism.\\n\\nIn order to sort out which elements of society should belong respectively to the sedentary and the mobile sectors, we have to take a closer look at symbiosis as Mother Nature has evolved it:\\n\\nThe generic rule of symbiosis is collaboration between species, with a large predominance of vegetal\/animal partnerships committed to the recombination of vegetal ADN between distant individuals, and subsequent geographical spreading of new identities through dissemination of seeds -- whereby the first step, called pollinization, is mainly carried out by flying animals, and the second by both terrestrian and flying animals through their excrements containing non digested seed. Note that some vegetals do it all by themselves through airborne seeds of the helicopter or parachute type (which by the way reminds us that neither the windmill and the chopper, nor the parachute are human inventions).\\n\\nI guess hard money should belong to the sedentary sector (maternity hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, public schools, colleges, universities, high-schools, utilities, public offices, hospitals, old age homes) with, however, part of its various professionnal actors as well as users pertaining to the mobile sector where independent and private entities (factories, offices) and their actors are yet predominant.\\n\\nThis symbiotic societal structure calls for highly developped individual mobility, i.e. a degree of freedom of movement by far not granted by the automobile, as it is tightly confined to a one-dimensional infrastructure (the road network) not only belonging to the State, but also leading only to places where the State deems to let its citizens go to -- whereby the only transport mode offering the required quality of individual freedom of movement is the vertical-take-off-and-landing personal aircraft.\\n\\nMoreover, in order to minimize the cost of access roads, buildings tend to concentrate along roads and road crossings -- a phenomenon which has led to insanely huge urban concentrations and sprawling of suburbs, with the collateral damage of emptying the surrounding countryside to the profit of socially and environmentally damageable industrial agriculture.\\n\\nHence, the first step to be undertaken is to have the Human Rights Chart's first article stating that every human being is granted ownership of a portion of land sufficient to grow enough food for himself of herself, in order to get people out of their multi-storey urban dwellings and back to the country -- which calls for large-scale land redistribution. The article should of course stipulate that personal land cannot be sold before the owner has reached a minimum age, and that the money can only be used for specific categories of investment, along with a limitation of land surface acquirable by any individual or entity.\\n\\nIn Switzerland, the part of farmers is less than 3% of the population, whereas I guess it should amount to anything like 20% to 30% -- and considering that state-of-the-art agricultural appliances and machinery allow for part-time farming, a new generation of half-time farmers could have their other half-time dedicated to any of the other professions, either by teleworking or commuting.\\n\\nOnly once these prerequisits concretized, could we start pondering the best way to balance hard and soft money -- noticing by the way that massively popularized individual aeromobility, together with the computer-based facilities mentioned by the author, would significantly boost the barter part of the new economy.\\n\\nFinally, since the substrate, i.e. the soil for a new, highly dynamic symbiot of the existing urban society has been created by this very same urban concentration in the form of emptied landscapes around the big cities, the transition might not be as slow as predicted by the author if in a first stage the actors of this new symbiot were able to rapidly occupy these empty spaces, thus ensuring their self-sustainability which I regard as a sine qua non prerequisit for the second stage, i.e. occupying the ailing urban economy.\\n\\nIn order to greatly speed up the initial phase of the process, the architecture of the personal homes of the new farmer community shoud be of the spherical type standing on a slim stem, so as to look like a leaf tree from a distance when covered with vegetation -- and a tiny sphere, at that, since neither kitchen, nor bathroom, nor laundry room are needed if the inhabitants can fly with their Personal Aircraft to collective sites where to take a shower, a swim, and a meal, while having their worn clothes processed in the launderette. Also this tiny sphere would be extremely lightweight compared to a rectangular house, so as to be transportable throug the airspace over long distances, which allows for mass-production of Personal Homes with a price tag comparable to a motorcar.\\n\\nAfter the PC, watch out for the PA and the PH !\\n\\nAnd I nearly forgot this: for practical reasons, the new-age part-time farmer community is deemed to entail a dramatic downsizing of dairy livestock in favor of vegetal crops, thus eliminating one of the biggest environmental pollution sources.\\\"\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-13T11:43:01+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"257464497674645\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kare Christine Anderson\",\"id\":\"100000521862131\"},\"message\":\"Some of the ideas, businesses and organizations covered at shareable.net might be helpful re the network of ecovilllages and re sharing models in general\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-13T13:34:18+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"257471797673915\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\",\"id\":\"14935\"},\"message\":\"fyi Christer S\u00f6derberg Stephen Hinton\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"697866199\",\"name\":\"Christer S\u00f6derberg\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":4,\"length\":18},{\"id\":\"1325647857\",\"name\":\"Stephen Hinton\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":23,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-13T13:51:51+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"257473411007087\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Wael AlSaad\",\"id\":\"591293415\"},\"message\":\"please give me energy to gain momentum in the direction of putting the concept of healing economic eco-village cluster.

Well, here goes.\\n\\nI am Kyle Sykes. I am a student-apprentice\/up and coming entrepreneur that wants to help create ideologies and design new platforms (working edge brands in action) for and around such things as:  open source education, decorums, makerlabs, collabtories, gamification, commons entrepreneurship incubation, agile coaching, resilient communities, hosting, superhero\/'global 'schools, qualification, culture hacking, open spaces, vocations, idea diffusion, hackerspaces, badges, and chronic or independent learning.  \\n\\nI am looking for mentorship in all schools of thought and practices so I can can build or add to these platforms. In the process, I then get add to the credentials and education I require to become qualified in different specialization and disciplines ( which mentors are qualified in or can at least teach), fields and subjects, ones I would be taught if I went to a traditional school. This is to get the knowledge and wisdom required to become autonomous, as in a true professional, which is recognized as educated ( being able to do 'shift'.)  \\n\\nPersonal misfortunes aside I want to be able to work, get trained, coached, and educated, network and create new relationships, regardless of the present circumstances of the status quo. These mentorships can be centered on chosen terms of agreement and mutual basis. Right now, I am stuck being in the center of that awkward space between the present world and edge based world, in transition, where things get blurred. For example, like what can be defined as a real and legit education during the shift.\\n\\nThis is an edge brand and a use of recursion in and of itself:  as in learning the things I want and need to become a professional through building on education as we know it. For multiple reasons, I think this is the best place to begin. \\n\\nI am aspiring to becoming a modern renaissance man. I am working on edge branding in order to get a better idea on what it is I want to do. For now, I am seeking mentorship. I am using open source learning, self-education, curation, and meta-design to create genuine source-material and powerful knowledge products to earn some thought leadership.\\n\\nThe goal is to become proficient in different schools of thought, able to use cross-referencing of disciplines when engaged in serious meaningful action. When I start to 'get it' and its time, I will then become a working pioneer and commons entrepreneur.  There is still much to learn. I know TNE has people working and doing all kinds of things, in all kinds of places, from all walks of life. I do not see this is as limitation, but something which creates mutual benefit, depending on common interests.\\n\\nFor those who might be interested in mentoring, please contact me at massinception@gmail.com.  My skype is tempestflux,  edgers please do not hesitate to send a personal message.\\n\\nThere are some potiencial and to-be mentors in the works, but not much has been established at this point. There is a lot going on, I need to be more clear sometimes, and I know that will happen soon enough. There can multiple agreements and mentorship going on at one time. If something comes to mind... and I don't care how long it lasts, if its paid or not (or offers little, because I do need to be able to take care of small bills, think of it as a stipend or microscholarship, I am searching for work but something in the edge would be ideal), please let me know. \\n\\nEducation, knowledge, talents, wisdom, and niches are the things I am seeking. Well I put it out there, I hope the ideas people come up with becomes something more than I can imagine, and then we can build on that.  This can also be chance for us edgers to make a better world for education- together.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/256547104433051\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/256547104433051\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-12T00:16:31+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-12T06:03:55+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\"},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\"},{\"id\":\"100000115676759\",\"name\":\"Sneha Latha VijaySai\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTIwNDc2NDgyNw==\",\"before\":\"ODc2ODgwMDc3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"256574414430320\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kyle Sykes\",\"id\":\"100002424772880\"},\"message\":\"I'l get there... one step at a time!\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-12T01:21:07+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"256575471096881\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Mark Roest\",\"id\":\"100000592737021\"},\"message\":\"Mark Roest <http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=100000592737021> Hello\\nKyle, I just read here about wanting mentorship, see the need for a gig on\\nyour other, older post, and the thought that came up is Permaculture or the Natural Building movement, which you can search the Net for; also found\\nthis today:\\nYahoo!

The giant corporations had lost numerous trials against labor leaders trying to organize unions. Striking was against the law at that time. \\\"Juries also ruled against corporations in damage suits and other cases, prompting influential members of the American Bar Association to fear that jurors were becoming too hostile to their clients and too sympathetic to the poor. As the American Law Review wrote in 1892, jurors had 'developed agrarian tendencies of an alarming character.'...\\\" (Barkan, Jury Nullification in Political Trials, 1983)[emphasis added]\\n\\nProhibition\\n     Despite the courts refusal to inform jurors of their historical veto power, jury nullification in liquor-law trials was a major contributing factor in ending alcohol prohibition. (Today in Kentucky, jurors often refuse to convict under the marijuana-prohibition laws).\\n\\n     As time went on fewer incidences of jury-veto actions occurred as the courts began concealing jurors' rights from American citizens and falsely instructing them that they may consider only the facts as admitted by the court. Researchers in 1966 found that jury nullification occurred only 8.8 percent of the time between 1954 and 1958, and suggested that \\\"one reason why the jury exercises its very real power [to nullify] so sparingly is because it is officially told it has none.\\\" (California's charge to the jury in criminal cases is typical: \\\"It becomes my duty as judge to instruct you concerning the law applicable to this case, and it is your duty as jurors to follow the law as I shall state it to you . . . You are to be governed solely by the evidence introduced in this trial as the law as stated to you by me.\\\") Today, no officer of the court is allowed to tell the jury of their veto power. \\\" http:\/\/www.isil.org\/resources\/lit\/history-jury-null.html\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-12T05:26:26+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MjU2NjczMjQ0NDIwNDM3\",\"before\":\"MjU0ODM2NDIxMjcwNzg2\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_256168091137619\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Thien Nguyen-Trung\",\"id\":\"618550262\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Currently judging entries for I3C (International Impact Investing Challenge) - Exciting submissions so far!

As did moving into a government institution-space. As much as I hope I am prepared, I discover there are so many things any kind of formalised education can't really teach me. Like dealing with work relations; managing conflicts or competition; group dynamics that not only differ from my previous experiences, but differ from one work place to another. After many discussions with friends, colleagues and my network we all came to the conclusion that explore this in Edgeryders, peer-to-peer. \\n\\nSo I'm starting by exploring the learning challenges and lessons of the first period at work, and ask that you describe an experience where you made the first step into any new position, learning for the first time \u2018on the job\u2019. You may have been employed, or an intern, or being mentored, or trying to develop a project of your own, or made a transition from studying a profession to practicing it.\\n\\nHow were you guided by others more experienced than yourself? How did you feel about the challenge? Was it challenging enough? Did anything go wrong and did you learn anything from it? What might have helped you learn more quickly? You can describe your own experience, or someone else\u2019s, or both. More stories will earn you more points!\\n\\nGood for you: Take this opportunity to reflect on what you have learned and how you grew outside of school, and feel good about yourself. It\u2019s something that\u2019s far from being easy! \\n\\nGood for everyone: Your reflections can help those that are younger to know what to expect and better prepare for their first work experience, lower or increase expectations accordingly; plus, you may just become a mentor for one of us Edgeryders!\\n\\nSo how do you participate?\\nIt\u2019s easy!

I'll let you guess who I was thinking about as is I read these excerpts:\\n\\nSex\\n\\\"A belief system that is quickly waning in HoloWorld is the idea that it is somehow very damaging to children to know about sex. The prevalent notion is rather that sex is a natural part of life, that children are created by sex, and that anybody, including children, can make better choices about something they are fully informed about.\\\"\\n\\nChildren\\n\\\"A child has the right to leave a family if they are able to make an informed decision on that, and if there is another family or community that is willing to take responsibility for the child.\\\"\\n\\nMorals\\n\\\"Some groups will have norms and common practices amongst themselves that other groups might find highly distasteful or immoral. Well, tough luck, basically. You can not go and hold another group to your norms, even if you don't like what they are doing amongst themselves. If the other group actively invades your territory and tries to push themselves on you against your will, then you have the right to be protected from that. However, the mere fact that another group exists and is publicly accessible or visible and interacting with other people does not qualify as any attack on your rights.\\\"\\n\\nSeems like we've chosen to learn nothing from the 60s commune movement, eh? Sandbox worlds are great, but real societies are very complex and systems based on the idea of \\\"men as angels\\\" struggle to move successgully beyond the sandbox. The 60s commune experience writ large - as well as the basics of group psychology - shows that taking away most of the rules and allowing everything become \\\"self organizing\\\", while relying on individuals to police themselves can and typically does degenerate into the power of the strong over the weak.\\n\\nNot meaning to be too negative here - rather constructive criticism should help improve this - but you can count me out\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-29T15:07:38+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"249532515134510\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Flemming Funch\",\"id\":\"511572735\"},\"message\":\"What frequently comes out in the criticism of something like Holoworld is that a lot of (otherwise very well intentioned) folks simply don't believe that significant self-organization will ever be possible, and certainly that it won't be scalable, and that there always needs to be an authoritative leader somewhere, in control of coercive force, to decide what is right in case of disputes. \\n\\nIndeed, there are some hard parts to work out, and some legitimate challenges that there needs to be answers developed for. Like, indeed, what to do if one group amasses considerable resources, including an army of obedient slaves and applies them towards ends destructive for the commons. I.e. something like a typical multi-national corporation.\\n\\nPart of the answer, I believe, is in sufficiently fault-tolerant information and action coordination networking between sufficient numbers of mostly well-intentioned people. We see crude, but effective, examples of that in the current internet. Somebody does something mean and easy to understand, like stuff a kitty in a trashcan, it appears on youtube, and suddenly it is this person against millions of outraged people, many of whom will be able to take steps to make this person's life hell from now on.  It is beginning to work, albeit also crudely, with more complicated issues, ACTA, Wikileaks, etc. Hurt the good guys and millions of people might be on the street next week. Still, badly organized, running on sketchy information. With an improved infrastructure, at some point, no hierarchical organization will be able to stand up against an informed self-organizing mob.\\n\\nThe checks and balances aren't all pretty either. Part of the idea in Holoworld would be to remove many the limitations that keep the population relatively powerless. In the old system you can be an asshole, even a completely destructive anti-social monster, as an individual, or as a company, and the government apparatus will stop anybody from messing with you. Not so in Holoworld. So, think about how things would work in a small community with no outside authority. Say you're stuck with a bunch of people on a desert island. Sure, it might become a Lord of the Flies thing, that's entirely possible. But think about what happens if you're an asshole to everybody else there. At best you would be ostracized. At worst you'll be strung up in a tree. There'll be no top-down protection for asshole-ness. You'll have to get along, or get out of the way.\\n\\nI know very well that some people will take such examples the wrong way, and hear something different than what is being said.

Even mobsters love their Mommas, for example. So you're kinda claiming victory on a hollow problem. \\n\\nThe question is how does the Holoworld deal with people who are assholes to some but support and are supported by others?

Likewise, a wide-open anarchy will just mean that a few well-organized gangsters will own the place before long. For it to work, it has to come from a place of networked strength, not just an optimistic hope that it somehow will work if we all try to be really nice to each other.\\n\\nYes, one of the really hard parts is probably how to identify and deal with sociopaths with many friends, who appear charming and social and good leader material to most, except for those who look a bit deeper. That's maybe the one biggest hindrance overall. For most of us it would be quite natural to cooperate or organize towards our common good and the good of all.

And as I suggested at the very beginning of the thread, these emerging communities will imo [need to] be connected through a distributed network so as to not be just scattered and juxtaposed tribes, but still constitute an interconnected network to ensure some exchanges and transactions... There is also the question of subsidiarity that is worth looking at. All cannot be localized and handled at the community level. Commons have natural boundaries that are not necessarily communal...

Thus, if there is a conflict within the tribe, elders can adjudicate simply from a position of respected wisdom, or can participate in a larger tribe-wide conversation where old stories, anectdotes and shared sensibility are used to come to a conclusion.  Obviously, this doesn't scale.\\n\\nMy vision is to use flows of reputation - and the access (or lack thereof) that these modulate - to replicate something quite similar to the tribal mode of jurisprudence.  Simply, everyone in the society is tasked with making honest evaluations of the people, ideas and experiences that they encounter.  These evaluations flow out to generate the determinations of the reputation and esteem of all of the points in the social field.  This reputation, in turn, is used to determine the capabilities and access of given individuals.  Access to resources (particularly sharables), to attention, etc.  Ultimately, access to the network itself (harkening to the concept of \\\"exile\\\").  This total field of evaluation takes care of chronic issues - e.g., something like BP would simply find itself drained of all access to resources by virtue of the collective distain for its practices.  This is quite different from what happens in the current environment where only \\\"memoryless\\\" money is part of the flow and the massive negative evaluation of the entity is left inchoate.  \\n\\nFor more acute problems (e.g., a specific dispute between two people), the ability to generate an ad hoc simulation of the old \\\"tribal elder:\\\" the disputants can agree to call any other member of the network who has adequate reputation to come and adjudicate their dispute based on his\/her wisdom.  If they can't agree, then the system will call three \\\"judges\\\" of adequate reputation who are determined to be network distant from the disputants to render their judgment in the dispute.  \\n\\nBy and large, adjudication involves allocating negative reputation and declaring Truth for the larger network's edification.  If necessary, the dispute can be expanded and a larger group of the network can be brought in - if the issue is important enough (lets say equivalent to jim crow in the south), it might very well spread to the entire network and become part of a collective moral question.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"82300937\",\"name\":\"Bret Weinstein\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14},{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Curtis Faith\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":16,\"length\":12},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":30,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-03-01T00:33:17+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"249804451773983\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jordan Greenhall\",\"id\":\"665043478\"},\"message\":\"Mark Frazier - http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/54232860\/The-New-Network.

The last chapter of the book, \\\"The Nine Laws of God,\\\" is a distillation of the nine common principles that all life-like systems share. The major themes of the book are:\\n\\n-As we make our machines and institutions more complex, we have to make them more biological in order to manage them.\\n\\n-The most potent force in technology will be artificial evolution. We are already evolving software and drugs instead of engineering them.\\n\\n-Organic life is the ultimate technology, and all technology will improve towards biology.\\n\\n-The main thing computers are good for is creating little worlds so that we can try out the Great Questions. Online communities let us ask the question \\\"what is a democracy; what do you need for it?\\\" by trying to wire a democracy up, and re-wire it if it doesn't work. Virtual reality lets us ask \\\"what is reality?\\\" by trying to synthesize it.

These images are slightly disturbing. I'm afraid I can't get some of the Third Reich imagery out of my mind, with its experimentation on ways to solve the \\\"problems\\\" of disability and ethnicity. \\n\\nHistorically, all of the major social innovations that we are familiar with have occured through processes that are arguably the opposite of the 'Lab' process - highly contextualised rather than spawned in artificial laboratory conditions; generated by users through participatory processes rather than through professional designers and facilitators; self-generated through DIY discovery rather than externally funded by governments or investors. \\n\\nI feel there is a deep contradiction between the desire for an application of 'science' in laboratory conditions to produce 'evidence' of social betterment, and the extensive rhetorical reference in much social innovation discourse to \\\"participatory user-centric\\\" processes.

Very happily back! The $5 minimum expenditure is simply a trial price point aimed at creating affordability for more people to support. Curious as to your thoughts. Suspect you've already seen this, but just in case: recipients of revenues (i.e. content publisher and website manager) only get paid when content attracts clicks. Monthly reports tell them how much they've made. Idea is that rather than relying on advertisers to get revenues rolling (content is after all 'king'), sites and their members will seek pledges from people who want to support what they do. For example, iDE's network will invite travelers (and others) to support the work of local journalists promoting their community and local biz. These journalists will then be able to use revenues earned to purchase local products.

That's why I like your community-based model.  Facebook is an impressive network, but the popularity of its one-size-fits-all format is globalization gone a little mad.\\n\\nOf course, that's Facebook's strength.  Similarly to Microsoft, it provides a single, universal interface.  The universality is for people to connect, the way Microsoft's is for software.  The weakness is that individual and community empowerment within its interface is quantified rather than qualified, while in the real world quality trumps.\\n\\nFor example, yesterday at TED community, which is all about the quality of ideas, Shilo Shiv Suleman presented a way to turn IT into an interactive children's theater for all ages, where we become the storytellers in a world where we mix magic and reality.  http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/shilo_shiv_suleman_using_tech_to_enable_dreaming.html. She'll have 100,000 viewers of her presentation there before 24 hours has passed.   Eventually, the hunger for that empowerment will bring a half million viewers to her work on that site.\\n\\nCompare that to the 1400 \\\"friends\\\" Shilo has amassed on Facebook since 2007, each one of them required to pay Facebook via advertising every time they visit her page.  Billions and billions of our dollars go to these corporations every year for their one idea, while our ideas languish behind their walls.  Not long ago, it was television that took our time and our power to make itself and its corporate sponsors wealthy.  YouTube returned some of that power to individuals...until it had us captured within its interface.  Now it and its corporate sponsors begin to divide their booty.\\n\\nFacebook manifestly followed the same formula, holding-off on making this interface into a billboard until we were stuck in its closed web.  But your model is the manifestation of the real power of the information superhighway, with every stop its own community marketplace.  And the Citizen Media structure that pays a third of the revenue to the community site managers can and might empower every community to have its own identity, its own unique online culture, rather than monoculture that corporations have brought to every exit on the real superhighways, with every traveler caught in its tiny world, just as we are caught in Facebooks snowglobe.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1385101876\",\"name\":\"Caroline Smalley\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":16}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-23T10:54:02+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"250369028384192\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Caroline Smalley\",\"id\":\"1385101876\"},\"message\":\"Thanks again for your comment, Kevin Parcell!

That's why we need both, but not to confuse the two. Which is Derman's extended argument in this paper. His books ia also worth reading, I gather. Here's some extended quotes from the paper that get at what he means:\\n\\n\\\"A model is a metaphor of limited applicability, not the thing itself. Calling a computer an electronic brain once cast light on the function of computers. Nevertheless, a computer is not an electronic brain. Calling the brain a computer is a model too. In tackling the mysterious world via models we do our best to explain the thus-far incomprehensible by describing it in terms of the things we already partially comprehend. Models, like metaphors, take the properties of something rich and project them onto something strange.\\n\\nA model focuses on parts rather than the whole. It is a caricature which overemphasizes some features at the expense of others.\\n\\nA model is a fetish in which the importance of one key part of the object of interest is obsessively exaggerated until it comes to represent the object\u2019s quintessence, a shoe or corset standing in for a\\nwoman. (Is that perhaps why most modelers are male?). But the shoe or corset isn\u2019t the woman, just the most important part of the woman for this model user.\\n\\n...\\n\\nTheories tell you what something is. Models tell you only what something is more or less like. Unless you constantly remember that, therein lies their danger.\\n\\nMy favorite theory is Dirac\u2019s 1928 theory of the electron, still correct today. He sought an equation that satisfied both quantum mechanics and special relativity. The one he found had four solutions. Two of them described the electron that physicists already knew about, a particle with negative charge and two spin states. But Dirac\u2019s equation had two additional solutions, similar to the ones he\u2019d already found, but with incomprehensibly negative energy. The positive-energy\\nsolutions described the electron so well that Dirac felt obliged to make sense of the negative energy ones too.\\n\\nDirac postulated that the void, the medium that we call empty space, what physicists call the vacuum, is in fact filled to its rim with negative-energy electrons, and they constitute an infinite sea. This metaphorical Dirac sea is the vacuum we inhabit, and, accustomed to it, we don\u2019t notice the infinite number of negative charges surrounding us. (We smell only pollutants, not air itself.) If this is true, argued Dirac, then when you shoot light into the vacuum and eject a negative energy\\nelectron, a hole is left behind. This absence of an electron and its negative charge behaves exactly like an electron with positive charge. Anderson discovered this so-called positron in 1932, and astounded all the physicists uncomfortable with what had been a metaphorical stretch. Just as life is a temporary hole in the darkness, so here too absence becomes a presence.\\n\\nDirac\u2019s equation transcended its metaphor and became a theory of reality. A brain may be like a computer, an atom may be like a miniature solar system, but an electron is the Dirac equation.\\nDirac\u2019s theory of the electron stands on its own two feet, beyond metaphor, the thing itself. Like God in the burning bush identifying himself to Moses, the theory of the electron pronounces, \u201cI\\nam that which I am.\u201d \\n\\nTheories are deep and inexplicable, difficult to find; they require verification; they are right when they are right. Models are shallow and somewhat easier to invent; they require explanation. We\\nneed models as well as theories.\\\"\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-28T03:20:05+0000\",\"like_count\":4,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"248677615220000\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Joe Brewer\",\"id\":\"543604988\"},\"message\":\"Michael, great comment!

As a consequence, in the short run we are all in debt. So it's deep shit all the time. It's the human condition. Economic models are simplified representations of reality. Humans simplify all the time to make things more understandable and to try to find a logical flow even when things are not logical. Humans are not purely rational, as we all know.

This post is not intended as a comprehensive review of the different uses of the term.  It reflects how I have used the term over 4 decades and how I have observed the term rise in usage. The distinction between emergence and transFORMation may be very significant, as related to Societal Metamorphosis.\\n\\nOne distinction between meanings relates to time frames.  It is said that new order emerges at the edge of chaos. \\\"The Origins of Order\\\" by Stuart Kauffman (1993).  Ilya Prigogine got his Nobel Prize for demonstrating emergence in a chemical reaction: \\\"Order Out of Chaos\\\" (1984). At the EDGE we see the dynamic phenomena of order appearing, seemingly spontaneously, from a dance of many potentials.  This is the process I view happening in Emergent-by-Design and The Next Edge, and personally find very exciting - much of the reality quite beyond my ability to comprehend.  This is emergence in the Here&Now.  There is also the concept of emergence unfolding in time.\\n\\nIn 1975 when I first proposed Societal Metamorphosis as a model for significant global change, I made a sharp distinction between transFORMation and emergence, as exemplified in the emergence of the butterfly. The butterfly doesn't result from a transFORMation of the caterpillar.  The caterpillar doesn't morph into the butterfly.  It doesn't slim down, sprout wings and spindly legs. There is a deep inner process where some cellular components of the organism (imaginal buds) commence self-organization and merge to form the butterfly emerging within the decaying form of the caterpillar. The butterfly form replaces the caterpillar form, it doesn't transform it.\\n\\nI was concerned, as an activist, that although activist movements emerged (in the first sense, above) they continued to envision as endgame the transFORMation of the existing societal systems.  I speculated that the nature of our overly complex and highly dysfunctional societal system was scientifically impossible to significantly transform.  When a part is improved by reform it causes disturbance in the whole, resulting in a backlash to block spread of the improvement. Defense mechanisms are too powerful for significant transformation of large, overly complex, and highly dysfunctional systems.  Yet, activist movements continued in their front line work without consideration of a realistic endgame.  Part of this may be because the term \\\"transformation\\\" had become the label for the highest form of change in New Age culture - and it remains so today.\\n\\nMy take on the emergence\/transFORMation distinction came from my academic work in physics and mathematics.  I first encountered the term \\\"transformation\\\" in mathematics. A mathematical form (expression) is operated on and changed (transFORMed) into a new form. Oldform to Newform, and in sequence. One can claim that \\\"scientific explanation\\\" must be in terms of mechanistic transformation.  As yet, there is no science of origination.\\n\\nMy take on \\\"emergence\\\" also came from physics. Thermodynamics is viewed as empirical patterns emergent from the theories of statistical mechanics.  Historically the laws of thermodynamics preceded statistical mechanics. But, mathematically, the equations of thermodynamics emerged from manipulations on the equations of statistical mechanics (the dynamics of material particles in collision).\\n\\nThus, I define \\\"emergence\\\" to be a process whereby a form spontaneously appears where there was no prior form to be transformed. Most of human creativity is emergence.  Once a new form emerges it is subject to transformation. Reality is a complex dance of emergence and transformation. A new science must emerge for this \\\"larger\\\" reality.\\n\\nThe transformation paradigm is very powerful, even among those most supportive of emergence.  It is very easy to slip back to seeking transformation, which anchors one to old forms as dominant contexts.\\n \\n An example is the paradigmatic power of economics and finance.  Many emergents envision their efforts leading to a transformation of financial and economic systems to forms radically different; but they start with existing forms. Modern civilization is obsessively econo-centric (what is good for GM is good for the country). In analogy to a biological organism, econo-centrism would deify the digestive system, obese is beautiful and don't worry about mobility or where you shit.  Capitalism, socialism, and communism are all econo-centric models.\\n \\n We are so indoctrinated into thinking econo-centrism that it is difficult imaging alternatives. Healthy and viable societies must have healthy economic systems, but their whole need not be dictated by them.  I play with an alternative where a strong societal subsystem is education redefined as \\\"organizing-for-learning-&-learning-for-organizing\\\".  This may be the core program for a new emergent humanity, where finance and markets follow.  Yet, the moment emergents begin discussing new societal forms, they focus on economics and finance.\\n \\n Another lockin to old forms is the confusion of a governance subsystem with a governmental component. The transformation paradigm calls for the establishment of a new government to manage the transformation which immediately precludes the participation in governance by all components of the system.\\n \\n This has led me to design a program of UPLIFT.  Economic-financial systems for populations where the vast majority lack sufficient competencies to participate in global decisions would be vastly different if the global population were rapidly uplifting in a distribution of relevant competencies.  IMHO, unless the whole population is competent in being active participants and contributors, humankind will always be dangerously unstable and unable to prepare for the challenges in the coming millennia (super volcanic eruptions, asteroid collisions, epidemics, earth changes) or to take real advantage of our awesome potentials.\\n \\nIMHO the forms of human organization necessary for our multi-millennial survival\/thrival cannot come from a transformation of our contemporary order.  This does not mean that reform efforts need be abandoned.  Often reform will be necessary to enable to societal butterfly to emerge without being destroyed by the collapsing societal caterpillar. And once new forms emerge transformation is essential for the necessary \\\"precision-of-fit\\\" for viability. It is just that we don't put all our eggs in the basket of somehow transforming the existing societal order into a new order meeting our criteria.\\n \\n If one considers the self-organized populations necessary to pressure a successful transformation of traditional society, one should consider whether it might be actually better to simply consider continuing spreading self-organizing to more people and replace, not transform, the old order.\\n \\n I actually encourage efforts to explore transformation solutions, although I personally view them as highly improbable.\\n \\n What is essential is that efforts exploring a metamorphic emergence be also on the agenda of emergents.\\n \\n It is not necessary that all emergents, those working within the first definition of emergence, contribute explicitly to this agenda.  It is hoped only that they would agree that efforts of some exploring the agenda of metamorphic emergence be supported.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/250163558404739\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/250163558404739\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-01T16:21:18+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-01T21:04:12+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\"},{\"id\":\"1138089017\",\"name\":\"Daryl Taylor\"},{\"id\":\"1045338394\",\"name\":\"Lucie Newcomb\"},{\"id\":\"100000751114585\",\"name\":\"Krzysztof Herbst\"},{\"id\":\"100000510077851\",\"name\":\"Colin Campbell\"},{\"id\":\"583936321\",\"name\":\"Lion Kimbro\"},{\"id\":\"674516612\",\"name\":\"John F Powers\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"Njc0NTE2NjEy\",\"before\":\"MTAwMDAxNDEzNjY0OTQy\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"250197181734710\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Braden\",\"id\":\"578038073\"},\"message\":\"I have always liked your concept of emergence Larry.

This posting is long and complex - but the magnitude of our challenge calls us to explore.\\n 1] Traditional: We are individual beings living on a common objective world. We each have different experiences with different parts of this external world and develop subjective beliefs as to our world and reality. Most people believe their subjective view of the world closely approximates objective reality. Others who differ have warped perceptions and biased thinking.\\n 2] Alternative: We are each \\\"worlds\\\" (which I will call \\\"wrlds\\\"), which contain representatives of  our \\\"self\\\" and \\\"others\\\". Extending Maturana & Varela's concept of Autopoesis, we are each \\\"Autopoetic Wrlds\\\" who interact by \\\"structural coupling\\\". In simple terms, each person is totally self organizing, even incapable of exchanging information; the alternative for interaction being a coupling of structures.\\n Speculative theoretic \\\"complexes of many wrlds\\\" are possible; but they need not have the characteristics of either everyday or scientific wrlds.\\n At this stage of human challenge, consideration of a meta-objectivity is probably both a waste of time and potentially disruptive.\\n\\nTHE TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVE - AN OBJECTIVE WORLD\\n The traditional perspective is usually adequate when working with our immediate environments: what we directly perceive and can agree to usage of terms with gestures. Since we are mobile and can experience many different immediate environments we construct an extended world of many immediate environments. We experience changes in immediate environments and generalize that changes could be occurring everywhere. We also directly perceive patterns of social behavior.\\n Humans have special innate competencies for social perception and behavior, built upon our tools for perceiving objects.\\n There is a wide diversity among persons in their competencies for social perception (and controlling behavior in social settings). This is a mix of inheritance and learning.  This diversity is critical when we consider wrlds.\\n Humans infer from their local social perception (in the context of their experienced physical environment) traditional social processes.\\n For example, we observe and often participate in social environments such a classroom, a worksite, a sporting event, a dance, etc.  We infer from these to theoretical entities such as schools, businesses, sport and entertainment systems - on to corporations, governments, and globalization. We erroneously attribute an empirical reality to these theoretical entities.\\n All this is very concrete and tangible.  Persons with different ideologies and backgrounds may initially interpret the same concrete setting differently - but with gestures they can come to common agreement as to what their immediate physical and social environments \\\"really\\\" are, even if they give them different values and interpretations. This was a fully adequate perspective for humans in tribal settings and for relating to both their natural and human constructed environments.\\n Trouble begins when we project our models of concrete, tangible worlds on theoretical structures and systems that cannot be perceived or gestured about.  Humans are prone to imagine objective worlds filled with things and behaviors that they can't see or point to; but yet believe that they know of them - with the same confidence they have for their immediate environments.  This is most troublesome for large social systems and collective human behavior.\\n We seem to have muddled along midst this confusion; yet who knows what the past millennia would have been like had we been able to distinguish between what we can empirically confirm mutually and what is inferred and requiring a different process for coming to agreement.  IMHO our Crisis-of-Crises is a direct product of this confusion and our survival\/thrival depends on inventing\/learning ways of working with this distinction.\\n\\nAUTOPOETIC WRLDS\\n Each of us lives in rich wrlds. [Our languages emerged for communicating in the traditional perspective and is clumsy when attempting to be used to share alternatives.] We cannot experience our wrlds, only small parts. Some wrlds emit experientials, the emission being the experiential.  Other wrlds have conscious selves that experience parts of their wrlds. Scientific wrlds postulate patterns of neural activity in brains that are associated with experientials and with an organization of the woven wrld - containing everything we (part of our wlrd) knows. Contemporary science (within wrlds) confirms we cannot have direct access to a hypothesized external world. Other wrlds may claim direct access beyond perception to \\\"others\\\"; but these claims cannot be confirmed for others.  We are autopoetic wrlds that contains autopoetic beings living in a hypothesized world.\\n This appears very strange, but we can continue to function in our immediate, concrete, tangible environments - where we have local relations with others and continue to do as we always have (maybe improving).  It is just that we must accept that EVERYTHING beyond the tangible is hypothetical and may well not be as we imagine.\\n SEMS [Semiotic Structures: Symbolic patterns in our immediate physical environments that catalyze experientials with \\\"meaning\\\" (a node in wrld).  Our exemplar will be patterns we observe on a screen or page: text, graphics, video sequences.]\\n All that we claim to know about what is beyond the immediate we infer from perceiving SEMS and conceptualizing on our experiences. Reports are concrete emissions from other wrlds attempting to relate their experientials.\\n SEMS have the unique character of being replicable and the accuracy of replication confirmable through direct observation and gesture. Persons may disagree as to the interpretation or meaning of a SEM, but there are procedures where they can agree that replications are accurate.\\n How might groups of wrlds decide on common action?  All SEMS relevant to the issue are collected and processed by intelligent technologies into summary SEMS capable of being perceived within each wrld.  A process then facilities dialog between wrlds, an exchange of more SEMS, until there is an agreement on a set of actions, which would include proposals for further sessions.  What is critical in all this is there is no assertion about TRUTH or an OBJECTIVE REALITY beyond the system of SEMS.\\n There may arise from this process a set of actions; some that may appear contradictory from a traditional perspective.\\n We have the technology today to begin exploring this alternative.\\n\\nSTRANGE WRLDS\\n When we stray beyond the immediate, concrete, and tangible we discover that hypothetical systems in our wrlds may follow different \\\"laws\\\". Quantum weirdness in the micro world is our exemplar. The many anomalies in the observations of the \\\"universe of cosmology\\\" hint that major shifts in the \\\"laws of the large\\\" are in process. Concepts of multiple universes now explored in both quantum and cosmological domains (at root, structures in the wrlds of those who encountered relevant SEMS) may have some weird applicability in hypothesizing new laws for multiple wrlds.  Similarly, the laws of psychology in our immediate perceptual wrlds may not apply to actions of our wrlds that transcend the ordinary, like sharing across paradigm differences, comprehending creative insights and swarming collective behavior.\\n As a new humanity emerges (hopefully by design), we must be open to the possibility that the \\\"nature\\\" of social systems, cultures, and institutions may violate the nature of laws from the immediate.\\n For example, we tend to treat institutions as objects with firm boundaries, with roles and persons performing to roles. This \\\"classical\\\" view may be very limiting, both in comprehending the ultra complex global-to-local phenomena we struggle with from the SEMS we each experience and as we design the equivalent of institutions and societal systems for emergent humanity.\\n An alternative view, as but one example of many, would postulate an ecology of  \\\"conspiratorial gangs\\\" with roots in our tribal heritage. Institutions might behave in ways quite inconsistent from their formal, hypothesized structure, where officials in that structure may have no knowledge or influence in what happens.\\n The increasing polarity of wrlds (e.g., Tea Party vs Progressives) emerges in pockets of exclusive SEMS.  Maybe, how this plays out may better be comprehended using quantum probabilities where alternative realities actually \\\"exist\\\" and interfere according to laws unknown.\\n\\nIS THERE TIME TO PLAY?\\n Is this a disruptive diversion?  Is there time for some people to play with these alternative ideas? Might it be that, from altered contexts strategies that looked very difficult from a traditional perspective might be practical from new perspectives? Do we really know what is happening that we can be comfortable sticking to our traditional views of reality?\\n Back to COMPLEMENTARITY, a concept I view as the most significant from the 20th Century; but still unknown to most.  Complementarity states that \\\"reality - whatever it is\\\" -cannot be represented by a single, logically consistent explanatory system. At least two, potentially contradictory schemes are needed that interact in ways yet unknown. Bohr in 1926 demonstrated that the data of empirical physics required a complementarity perspective. Bohr's speculation that complementarity apply to domains beyond physics was not well received.\\n It is fully proper to use the traditional perspective in our daily, immediate, concrete and tangible interactions. We shift to the alternatives when considering hypothesized systems beyond the immediate and difficult for confirming agreement. This is like my being well versed with the metric system when working in science but a total klutz when asked to use metric in everyday situations.  I am bilingual re measurement, but can't translate.\\n This is one (of many hundreds) of alternative speculative themes that have emerged within my wrld (which Larry calls nuet) over the decades. No SEMS or sets of SEMS seem to portray their potential significance. This text emerged from nuet for this posting and doesn't contain references to other documents created in prior decades related to this topic.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/249122595175502\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/249122595175502\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-28T21:41:07+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-01T19:53:32+0000\",\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"249125265175235\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Larry Victor\",\"id\":\"1224823408\"},\"message\":\"Sorry about the lack of formatting.

The problem is that we have inherited and kept these values and use them as the fundamental for all we do.

You guessed it... once again capacities, expression, and language.\\n\\nI'm going to take a chance and put this out there. \\n\\nJust like the ancients (and primordial cells) did, when new paradigms and languages and capacities were in thier infancies. We make it up as we go along. \\n\\nProblem: There is no common grammer and language for different roles, guide-leaders, pioneer tribes and change agents. Hence this creates great tension when working to align paths. \\n\\nIf we can not 'speak' or act each of our unique paradigms (or noospheres) into real capacities (being part of the world as we know it) then nothing gets accomplished.\\n\\nSolution: Make it up as we go along, but also go with what we know. If need be, make up new rules, and erase broken ones, including ones TNE makes up.\\n\\nHow to Manifest: Use Edge Tropes (Our paradigms\/visions\/languages) and Core Memes (our capacities\/items\/projects) - TNE uses a lot of them as it is and tends to make a lot of them up and track progress of their manifestation based on the degree of abstraction to being tangible.\\n\\nThink of memes like being apps and tropes as manifestos. For culture hacking, expression and self-iniatiation of path to manifest it is meme code\/programming, and impression or reaction is (re)alignment\/protocol.\\n\\nIf defientions and language or grammer 'agreements' of memes are within the scale of its manifestion or diffusion contiunum. \\n\\nThink idea to actualization, as defined under the paradigms of the change agents of the groups, clans, guilds, and other assortments \\nmanifesting them. If there is resonance between certain Edge Tropes and Core Memes and then network and link the others in curated 'Recursion Bibles.' \\n\\nSome can macro, others micro, and all things in-between. The Recursion Bibles would also track the progress on the manifestion continuums. (How close an idea, or step, or a project is from imagination to actualization.)\\n\\nCuration\/Social Evolution\/Recursion: The Recursion Bibles could be treated like both tags and portals (or tag portals), which 'inflect' the dispersion of momentum between things like paradigms and capacities, means and ends, flow seasons, and back again. The portals\\nare also continums. \\n\\nWhen Recursion Bibles are listing content ( the tag bit) and information thier being used as paradigms and speech, when the networks and resources listed are in the process of actualization and being used, \\ntreat them as capacities and mediums (the portal bit), with metrics and thresholds of implication.\\n\\nTag portals are the spaces of relation and contact, which I dub thresholds. In order to creategreater alignment, lessen friction and tension, generate resonance and get shift done. Each of us has our own codes\/path, which I see as recursion. \\n\\nNow what I presented was all paradigm, or the tag. If this idea with the recusion bibles is enacted it will become a portal, making us one step closer to the world that each of us imagines. \\n\\nI title this particular recursion bible and tag portal: [ #META-Design Thinking: Imagination to Actualization, through Recursion BY Design. ] - Almost sounds like an essay, heh. But it could be as simple a tag as #scenius or #epic win!\\n\\nI think the emergence of change is created when the spacing out\/building paradigms capacities is in alignment with the folding\/ manifesting capacities. Think of life as binary, paradigms are 0 and capacities are 1. More or less. Sort of Kind of. This almost makes me think of nemetics. \\n\\nRecusion Bibles\/Tag Portals could be used under the same or loose-based templates of 'normal' culture hacking, like TNE has used for a couple threads. \\n\\nUse other edge tropes, recursion bibles\/tag portals and core memes as secondaries and tetaries, etc to back up the primaries. The scaling could based on contiunum resonance. Just list or curate them, in the same nature as biblographic sources.\\n\\nCore Memes are the Self-iniated and co-created prototypes and projects. Edge Tropes are like the Juntos and Metaops and Data or categorization (think the 5 'hats') to help get all of them in alignment. \\n\\nThis epiphany came on the top of my head, and to some degree I might not know (and acknowledge this) what I am talking about... but this particular snowcrash was quite the rush!\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-29T02:43:32+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"249272671827161\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kyle Sykes\",\"id\":\"100002424772880\"},\"message\":\"It's also kind of like integrating and complementing 'Shift' logic - Tangibles\/Hard logic\/with capacities - don't think too hard about this metaphor-' and 'Fuzzies' logic with paradigms -\\n\\n(I know the translation and metaphors of those concepts isn't ideal, but it works, and if isn't broken, don't fix it, unless someone feels the need to let me know otherwise) which I know someone else posted before. \\n\\nhttp:\/\/blog.p2pfoundation.net\/the-case-for-soft-money\/2012\/02\/22\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-29T02:50:29+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"249278765159885\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kyle Sykes\",\"id\":\"100002424772880\"},\"message\":\"Things also coming to mind are improv theatre\/games and LARPS. - Live Action Role Playing.

Ageing populations...in China.\\nHT Nancy, but I would be more precise because the ageing of China spells predetermined instability, which the CCCP hates and which they try to avoid by driving as much growth as possible before then....a truly Catch-22 situation, if ever there was one...and of course China drives the world right now. The declining populations in Europe are baked into everyone's calculations and U.S. corporations know their ageing Boomers so well, because they've lived with them all their lives, that they have already figured out what to sell them lifestyle and medical insurance and reverse mortgages and tourism. The current D-process and its effects on the future retirement-era spending habits could make the American senior as important as the Chinese ageing - e.g. if things got really bad and they had to spend all their savings on their kids while they were still alive, instead of passing them on to them when they die - but part of me doesn't want to give the Boomers, who've been pandered to their whole lives, that satisfaction. (You know the majority Christmas \/ holiday music now played in commercial environments at that time of year are tunes from the time when Boomers were kids?)\\n\\n2. The breakdown of the projection of U.S. power since the Iraq war. Also influenced by the rise of China, but fundamentally driven I believe by the renewed sense, globally, of the vulnerability of U.S. armed forces abroad which happened when the IED revolution kicked off in 2005\/6. I see that fairly and squarely as having been activated by external powers, mainly Iran but also some Sunni states. Eventually that realization got back to the U.S. foreign policy mainstream also. Which leads us to drones and to refocusing on the nuclear race. It would be a terrible strategic mistake for the U.S. to not try hard to set up a stable nuclear situation before passing whatever threshold it is at which it loses uni-polar status. Hence Iran. \\n\\n3.The fact that the race between the promise of energy abundance through technology and the Mathusian constraint of resources and population seems to many observers to have tipped in the wrong direction. \\nObvious really but framing it in this way is helpful. Interpret \\\"the observers\\\" and \\\"wrong\\\" whatever way you want - the point is there is fundamental disagreement at this really basic level, which seems to many people like the line between optimism and pessimism, or patriotism and defeatism, or science or religion or elitism or some other such shit.

The story of this young jourlaist surfaced exactly when I was traveling back to the US hence I surely regret being cut out from Arab conventional media coverage on this, most importantly Al-Jazeera which would have been an excellent source. So Alex Lavigne-Gagnon I am sorry you have been missing much on Arab news by taking a negative stand on Al-Jazeera. Some progressive Arab friends of mine share your views but for other reasons: some are critical of the Qatari government's current role in Syria (something I don't share). Note that the government of Qatar, main financeer of Al-Jazeera, is not on best of terms with Saudi government. I noticed in one of the postings of Alex that he is aware of Al-Shiekh's tribe relevance to this case of the journalist. The audiece needs to understand that when the Saudi state came to existance, a deal was struck between the Al-Saud the current ruling tribe and Al-Sheikh tribe whereby Al-Saud would rule while Al-Shiekh would deal with all religious matters. Neither tribe is supposed to interfer in the business of the other. Having said that the scandal of a girls school burning and which implicated some of Al-Sheikhs a few years back prompted AlSaud ruler (who is now the current ruler) to undertake serious corrective action against Al-Sheikhs. He transferred mandate over girls education in Saudi out of Al-Sheikhs and into ministry of education as the case had been with boys school. So as you can tell, the situation as everything else in the middle east is complicated. I am pround of Arab youth who started Arab spring. So my new social media tribe and in answer to Liz's question on how can NE network help, my first immediate response is: please support youth Arab Spring. Now back to this young journalist. I only read part of what he wrote and in English through the posting on Al-Jazeera. I am yet to find and read full text in Arabic but find nothing against Islam in what he said. Actually the compassion he clearly reflects in the voice of the Prophet shows a unique sense and sensibility on the part of this young journalist which is welcome in Islam. So maybe his case will be like the girls burining school scandal when the governement will step in because of international media etc. Sorry for writing too long of a response.

Sacral (Pleasure)\\n\\nhealthy perspective: animated by magnetism, opening to the enjoyment of the experience of life; aroused energy often dominated by sexuality, but not limited to it; experiencing pleasure with awareness and appreciation - enjoying the pleasure instead of the pursuit of pleasure\\n\\nimbalance: habit forming indiscriminate pleasure-seeking (sex, alcohol, cigarettes, chocolate, drugs), hedonism, becoming obsessed with sexuality and magnetism\\n\\nadaptive response: search for pleasure is never completed by a sense of fulfillment; desire to lose oneself in stimulating sensations; jealous rage and over-attachment; anxiety concerning your attractiveness; feelings of inadequacy in comparison to others\\n\\nhealthy variation: a creative and controlled passion for life; the search for pleasure is balanced with the art of experiencing enjoyment (desire and appreciation); instead of focusing on what you don't have, you take delight in what is available\\n\\nc.) Solar Plexus (Power)\\n\\nhealthy perspective:the seat of your willpower and the center that gives mobility to your life - the ability to initiate activity, to define boundaries, and defend yourself from an encroaching world; leads to self-mastery (self-control, self-restraint, self-discipline); development of principles, ethics and beliefs for which you are willing to stand; discernment\\n\\nimbalance: overuse - competition, conflict, battle, ruthless ambition, fear of letting go, need to prove yourself; underuse - feeling guilty when you say \\\"no,\\\" inability to assert oneself, lack of self-esteem and self-confidence, acting the \\\"martyr role,\\\" guilt and shame drive you from standing up for yourself and you seek redemption by being a \\\"good person\\\" and by doing what is expect of you by others (being of service vs. being a servant) \\n\\nadaptive response: one-upsmanship interferes with your life and you immediately become defensive when confronted with any opposing views\\n\\nhealthy variation: assert yourself when the situation requires and have the inner strength to be passive when appropriate; since you are not projecting an imbalance of power, you do not attract power conflicts to you; discriminating use of will; awareness of intentions\\n\\nd.) Heart (Love)\\n\\nIntegration Point: Paradigm shift from fear-based mentality to belief in abundance; the awakened heart drops down defenses and comes from the place within us that is joyful; you experience love, or at least harmonious connection that transcends differences between you and others; the lower three chakras deal with individual energy, separate and distinct from others. the upper three are the collective aspects of self. the heart integrates the personal and spiritual, ego and spirit; you are able to enjoy the vitality of the lower physical chakras, as well as the bliss and creativity of the upper ones; you find out what you love to do, do it, and share the resultant joy with others; you're able to accept those you meet and genuinely care for them, without getting drawn into their dramas; being able to give without expecting anything in return, being able to receive graciously from others; the heart chakra is the center, the seat of the soul\\n\\nhealthy perspective: ability to glimpse a world beyond survival and competition; you see yourself reflected in everyone you meet; bias towards cooperation, not coersion; there is nothing to defend, and joy comes from an immense acceptance of life and other people; unconditional love is experienced with others\\n\\nimbalance: 'bleeding heart' - inability to separate one's problems from those of others, leading to doing things for others as the price for being accepted; over-attachment in love and codependency; indiscriminate love; giving in to the demands of others just to avoid conflict; guilt and shame about the suffering of others, as if it were your fault\\n\\nadaptive response: awakening to suffering and becoming preoccupied or immobilized by it\\n\\nhealthy variation: challenges handled with a touch of grace; your compassion for suffering in the world translates into action; feelings of separateness drop and is replaced by the feeling of being here together with others experiencing this same miracle of life; cultivation of a love for life and creation itself\\n\\ne.) Throat (Creativity)\\n\\nhealthy perspective: self-acceptance of your uniqueness and originality; find your voice and speak your truth (the authentic voice within); experience of detachment, observation, and synthesis of varying views on life; personal insight merges with the collective mind and creativity is born; looking at life with a fresh perspective of discovery and allowing for innovative thinking; self-expression\\n\\nimbalance: a feeling of the right for independent thinking, but no discipline with its expression; opposing other's views because you \\\"can,\\\" rebelling against consensus reality, defensiveness and rigidity in new beliefs; need to prove your views are right; becoming attached to viewpoints; deception; inability to assert your ideas\\n\\nadaptive response: becoming a nonconformist as a reaction against others, instead of as an open expression of yourself\\n\\nhealthy variation: a security in your creative identity; having original insights by always looking at life with fresh eyes; always having the ability to express your view and speak your truth; ability to entertain any idea with an open and questioning mind; you help awaken people from their slumberous thinking and catalyze others to awaken to their authentic self\\n\\nf.) Third Eye (Transcendence\/Intiution)\\n\\nhealthy perspective: hunger to experience the magic and meaning of life; drive to experience a transcendent reality beyond the everyday view of life; imagination as the vehicle of transcendence; the world of images, beyond thoughts; the ability to see the Divine in all things; intuition is experienced as a type of knowing beyond strategic thinking; ability to sense if your current path is aligned with your true path or not; ability to transcend polarity\\n\\nimbalance: imagination disassociating from mundane reality; getting lost in realms of fear, escapism and illusion; inability to discern the impact of your imaginative wanderings on your energy field; confused vision instead of inspiration; guilt and feelings of unworthiness; inability to separate imagination from reality\\n\\nadaptive response: being \\\"spaced out\\\" and unable to interact with normal reality in a conscientious way; undisciplined imagination - obsessive sexual fantasizing, daydreaming, revenge, escapism; imagining qualities in others they can't possibly live up to, falling in love with qualities that are not there\\n\\nhealthy variation: develop the ability to experience life from the Witness seat - ability to observe yourself with in action, being involved and also aware of the involvement simultaneously; being detached while being involved provides wisdom and insights into the meaning of life; an awareness of a greater reality occurring beyond your individual will; ability to resolve conflict situations by finding the vantage point that sees a larger reality that both polarities are part of\\n\\ng.) Crown (Spirituality\/Unity)\\n\\nhealthy perspective: pure, undifferentiated cosmic energy; desire to experience the Divine; surrender to the entire experience of life as having a purpose - \\\"knowing\\\" - and choosing to accept or deny the responsibility of this knowing\\n\\nimbalance: living a life anchored in a separate reality, real to you, but not integrated with the world around you\\n\\nadaptive response: inability to interact with the everyday world in an effective way; being haunted by the embodiments of your fears\\n\\nhealthy variation: absolute surrender to the highest voice you believe in (not sacrifice. sacrifice implies letting go of something you value. in surrender to something higher, you trust all you value will come into alignment as well.); living life that is absolutely in everyone's best interest, including the self; a level of consciousness that is the full awareness that All is One; liberation and true freedom - beyond fear, freedom from limiting and restricting views of reality; linear sense of time dissolves into an awareness of circular time; patience blossoms; all of life is a spiritual path - Life is great!!\\n\\nHow does this resonate, or map to your own self-inquiry process?\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/247125575375204\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/247125575375204\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-25T16:50:46+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-28T05:23:24+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"636340760\",\"name\":\"Ross Dawson\"},{\"id\":\"501424048\",\"name\":\"John Love\"},{\"id\":\"709937114\",\"name\":\"Mitra Ardron\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzA5OTM3MTE0\",\"before\":\"NjM2MzQwNzYw\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"247150642039364\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Scott Lewis\",\"id\":\"880215312\"},\"message\":\"U rock.

A newly launched \u201cGold from Garbage\u201d YouTube channel, sponsored and supported by RateMyProfessor.com, seeks to attract hundreds of thousands of students each month to select the most dismal classes.  Each student in the five classes voted as most dull will receive a condolence prize of $10.  The second round of prizes will go to students around the world who research the topics ostensibly covered in the least engaging lectures, and prepare brief videos or animations that impart the knowledge in a stimulating and accurate way.

The Uplift Academy Partnership has provided a smorgasbord of alternatives to 100 households with high school students and\/or unemployed workers. After designing custom \u201cpersonal learning networks\u201d in response to each household\u2019s reskilling and educational aspirations, it delivers on-demand learning, work-study projects, and \u201copen badge\u201d certifications to help members enter into new actual and virtual markets.  A popular track for households in the initial 18 month trial consisted of acquiring skills to lower living costs, through microfarming, alternative energy solutions, shared use of 3D printers, and wellness\/health practices.  In return, participating households agreed to share a portion of earnings from success in finding employment or launching businesses in related fields, in budget savings from reduced food, energy or other household costs, and\/or an agreed share of future home value gains through \u201cco-ownership mortgages.\u201d  The agreement specifies that municipally owned properties \u2013 at mutually agreed locations \u2013 may be transferred in the future as a land grant endowment to the Uplift Academy Partnership. In this case, participating households will be released from any contingent repayment obligations, while the Academy will continue to provide its personalized learning support to make the community a more attractive place in which to live and work...

I've focused on this second question for past 20 years and have outlined four strategies which you can see in this map: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/TMC-4-Part-Strategy . The first strategy is focused on collecting information.  I feel that until education information is plotted on maps which also include demographic information we'll have people in a big room using the same words but meaning different things because the issues the kids bring to school with them are different as are the resources the schools have to address those issues.  If education, health, crime, poverty were layers of information on maps we could see that the big cities have one set of problems while the rural areas have another. We could form groups around common issues and with all of those in a group talking about the same problems there can be more convergence and commitments to solutions.  Using maps to provide better information is just one strategy.   Aggregating the ideas of others who are thinking about this into one network of web sites is another. My links library at http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/TMC-Library is just one example. However it has over 2000 links and points to web sites that also have many links. You can't digest this in a single conversation. Instead it needs to be thought of as a library that people from many places can learn from over many years. For that to happen steps #2 and #3 in the strategy I outline need to be in place. #2 focuses on on-going public awareness efforts and #3 focuses on information facilitation similar to how people in faith groups all over the world spend time in small groups every week helping others find and understand bits of information related to their beliefs. The result of these first three steps might be a more consistent flow of ideas, people, dollars, etc. to all of the places on the map which show the greatest need for extra support to help kids through school and into jobs and adult lives.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T14:51:48+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"246503308770764\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Steve Wright\",\"id\":\"733480644\"},\"message\":\"OK, so I have clearly let my passion\/frustration\/interest in this topic get the best of me.

It is the schools in the poorest or financially struggling areas that need the most help. In these places, the school system problems are only a symptom of the larger societal problems for the place in question (as Liz McLellan pointed out).\\n\\nFor these struggling areas, a full ecosystem program is needed, to create lasting resources in the community, to get the people of the community engaged in co-maintaining the resources, and to give them control and ownership over them. Let's use a real-world example: the City of Detroit. \\n\\nIn the city of Detroit, the struggling \\\"communities\\\" are in some cases really loose collections of people who are at the mercy of scant employment and following the affordable barely-maintained housing stock around every few years. There is no connection between the companies that employ (and generally barely pay) these people, and their conditions of living, their communities, their education systems, food systems, etc.\\n\\nSo, along the lines of what Mark Frazier is describing, any kind of progress in school systems would also need to be tied to progress in economic opportunity, availability of food, energy, ongoing support for adults to work together as a community and co-govern resources. in my view, a good candidate way to address these problems is food, energy, manufacturing, credit unions, and a new model for schools: cooperative based schools, where the parents and community members are co-owners of the school, funding is tied directly to other local economic activity older students mentor younger students, community businesses offer apprenticeships, resources for education are created locally, and in collaboration with other education cooperatives, and pooled into an open education resource foundation for use by all. Students learn by both peer learning, and individual performance, and their learning is centered around participating in real world problems in the later years of education, rather than shielding from the outside as the majority of activity.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"14935\",\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":57,\"length\":12},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":432,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T15:39:18+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"246513798769715\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Tom Sherlock\",\"id\":\"1574340159\"},\"message\":\"Personally, I would offer to teach a class on programming (PHP, C++, Java, Javascript) in my own town's public (property-tax funded) school pro bono.\\n\\nIn a less personal and perhaps more abstract way I would suggest a review and adoption of homeschooling methods as well as the inclusion of extra-curricular activities as part of the accredited curriculum, such as dance, basketball, singing, musical instruments, girls scouts, and other sports and performing arts.

A simple example of an assumption that will have to be re-examined is the question of \\\"school as constructing a sense of nation\\\".  Our current public education system has as one of its values the constitution of a certain national uniformity - in the sense that everyone in a given country has a set of shared values and implicit structural ideas that allows them to identify and operate as similarly enculturated individuals.  A different set of values might have widely and wildly differing structures, techniques and content - leading to a diffusion of collective enculturation.

The first is for the \\\"reboot\\\".  At the risk of being overly practical, let's start there.   As Sam Rose mentions above, communities with resources have good schools so even if we assume the system is broken (as opposed to under-funded or poorly executed) it is not so broken that it doesn't work for some. So, who does it work for? 1) It works for people with money\/resources. Again pointing to relevance of Sam's and Liz McLellan comments above that education quality is highly influenced by community health. 2) It works in Super-Hero schools where brilliant educators have dedicated their lives and attracted others. 3) It works as Liz mentions above, in places like Exeter. \\n\\nWhat do we take from this? Our educational system is explicitly designed to maintain the American Caste system.  It effectively educates the ruling class and only let's through a few others in order to keep the Horatio Alger myth alive.\\n\\nFrom a broad pedagogical point of view, there are no new ideas.  We have been actively ignoring fantastic ideas for years.  I made a short and very incomplete list of fantastic educational thinking above. My theory is that we have been choosing not to engage with these ideas because of a fundamental definition of the purpose of education. Jordan Greenhall 's comments about the purpose of education: \\\"school as constructing a sense of nation\\\" vs. something more experience based and individual like Waldorf. This is an ancient discussion.  This fundamental education reform is like saying let's make peace in the Middle East.  Both of these things are possible and we must include in our discussion the scope and scale of actually doing something about this.\\n\\nAssuming we want to make this fundamental change happen, a change that will equip the greatest possible number of our children with the tools they need to lead us to a sustainable future that makes contentment and happiness possible, that is where we need innovation.

We have a systemic 'problem,' and the issue of the educational system is but one branch\/lens\/piece. \\n\\nYes, there are many topical things that can be done within the school themselves, but if we step back from the school context, we're not just asking 'how can students receive a better education.' We might say 'how can students engage more fully in the learning process?'  - this applying to how they negotiate experimenting, taking risks, adapting and reflecting in situations outside of just school. \\n\\nAnd if we step to yet another context, we might think of ourselves as human beings, who in our very nature have the capacity to learn, grow and unfold over the entire course of our lifetimes, and are empowered to do so by having certain conditions and environments and behaviors to guide us, such as:\\n\\n- having courage to exercise the expression of our beliefs, through creative action and artistic output\\n- being able to be vulnerable in front of others and able to ask for help, or say \\\"i don't know,\\\" or say \\\"i wonder if\\\" or \\\"i'm curious about\\\" \\n- by being able to accept another person's different perspective as not something that needs to be changed to fit our own, but an opportunity to understand various ways people see things, and the underlying assumptions behind them, which can help us more critically analyze our own thought processes and afflictive emotions\\n- by feeling supported by others through unconditional love, by feeling accepted, encouraged, and nurturing to really embody the greatness that lies within each of us\\n\\nand so forth\\n\\nDo schools create this kind of environment? \\n\\nDo our homes? \\n\\nDoes the surrounding culture?\\n\\nI experience these things in small pockets, and I feel blessed and grateful.

That second, more abstract level of learning is where the discrepancy becomes visible.\\n\\nA banal example of how this plays: The head football coach at my college stopped accepting any requests to speech at sports banquets. He was however active in supporting all manner of educational projects: best readers, he was there; Eagle Scout community projects, he supported them; music recitals and drama, he was enthusiastic. \\n\\nHe loved football and his players. He loved how football developed the talents of his students. But to him the value in celebrating the accomplishments of football players could only make sense when we celebrated the diverse accomplishments of our students in schools.

The reason I say the things I do is that I feel strongly that the teachers are asked to take responsibility for fixing what is OUR fault, our deficits in love, our deficits in caring about other people's kids, our ideological games and strategems... We put the onus in the wrong place I think. Point one finger at a teacher - three come back to ourselves and the culture we create. A great example just a slice - is the book Reviving Ophelia. Noting that we short change boys completely as well... Reviving Ophelia makes plain the immense pressure the wider culture ( media, sexism etc) place on girls at crucially important development stages. It starts with Toddlers in Tiaras, moves through hyper-sexualized tween stars and moves them right into Miss Universe and music video T and A. The message that they get very early on is it doesn't matter what you think - it matters what you look like. The drop off in girl's preformance in school across the board in the US is steep - and happens after 9 years old. Like African American kids who get dinged for \\\"acting white\\\" - meaning pursuing expanding their intellect - girls learn that smart women are bitches, old women are hags and the only females that count are hot.

In my opinion, kinds of discussions could really go somewhere if we used a real place as a basis for discussion. Like one city or one community that has all of the dynamics we are discussing (including a public school system).  Otherwise, it just gets into pontification territory, and over-generalization. The problems are both more complex, and more complicated than they are usually portrayed to be in general discussions about society at large. \\n\\nAll of that being said, I do realize this discussion started as a question in general from Bruce Tizes So, to stay on topic with his question in this respond: I agree with Curtis Faith and Liz McLellan as I said earlier in the discussion, that the problem has to be addressed from a whole ecology perspective, not a schools system perspective. Furthermore, I think that we are moving away from a society that responds to \\\"mass\\\" solutions of any kind, no matter how well thought out, and towards a society that responds better to approaches that address unique local conditions, and listens to people as the primary driver for where to divert resources. We can get out of ongoing funding on a state and federal level for resources like schools *only* when communities have a robust means to meet this need on their own, with their own local wealth generation. Every community *deserves* to have wealth generating ecologies in place that they drive,with a fallback to all of us in case of disaster or misfortune. Getting these local capacities in part means changing education to respect and really teach everyone (not just children), along the lines of what Curtis Faith suggested above. I think we are going to have a chance to help in this space as the higher education bubble, and 20th century schools systems in general, collapse in the coming years. I consider this to be inevitable, save for a radical \\\"middle ground\\\" move by the Obama administration and a new congress after 2012 (I suppose there is at least small chance that could happen.

Is investigative journalism on the rise or fall in terms of scope of their ambitions?\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQAkSlsO6oTmRs63&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphics8.nytimes.com%2Fimages%2Fcommon%2Ficons%2Ft_wb_75.gif\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/02\/28\/world\/europe\/murdoch-hacking-inquiry-expands-to-uk-officials.html?hp\",\"name\":\"Murdoch Hacking Inquiry Expands to Officials\",\"caption\":\"www.nytimes.com\",\"description\":\"The officer leading the police investigation into Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers said on Monday that reporters and editors at The Sun tabloid had over the years paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for information.\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/248352111919217\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/248352111919217\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-27T17:59:23+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-27T17:59:23+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_247613925326369\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Venessa Miemis\",\"id\":\"630505808\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"Jim McCarthy\",\"id\":\"745200944\"},{\"name\":\"Michele McCarthy\",\"id\":\"746613035\"},{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Human Protocol Proposal: <<Attribution Check>>\\n\\nI've been inspired by the Core Protocols for Shared Vision (http:\/\/liveingreatness.com\/the-core-protocols.html), developed by Jim Mccarthy & Michele McCarthy, and want to propose an Attribution Check protocol as something we can use.\\n\\nThere are many similar ideas all floating in the noosphere right now, and many people attempting to describe them with clarity so they can be summoned into existence more rapidly. \\n\\nIt has been called to my attention that it may appear to some who do not know me that I am trying to steal ideas or claim them as my own when I write about them on my blog. This is certainly not my intention. I try to write about my own learning and discovery process, and to shine attention on the many many people out there who are working towards our human emergence. If I do not credit a source, it is out of forgetfulness or lack of awareness of a precedent, not deceptive intent. (I also acknowledge this is not an acceptable excuse, especially if we are trying to collaborate and co-create more tightly and build trust.)\\n\\nSo, I want to make it clear that I am trying to promote ideas that matter, and not take them as my own. I also want to propose that all the ideas are out there in the collective mind already, and perhaps as we go forward in constructing new knowledge, we start with an assumption that anything put forth is building on the shoulders of giants.\\n\\nHere is the protocol proposal. <REVISIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT WELCOME>\\n\\nAttribution Check \\n \\nAttribution Check supports your ability to act as an effective, continuing conduit for information, by helping you to retain awareness of information sources and to provide helpful attribution for others. Use Attribution Check to determine whether you or others have credited the source\/s of the information presented. Use it when you intend to publish, collaborate, cooperate, or co-create with others.\\n \\nSteps\\n \\nTo use on yourself:\\n \\n1.      Ask \\\"What is the source of this information?\\\"\\n\\n2.      Ask \\\"Have I clearly stated the source of the information, if originated outside of self?\\\"\\n\\n3.      Ask \\\"Have I acknowledged that there may be precedents to the information I'm sharing, of which I may be unaware?\\\"\\n\\n \\nTo use for another (who is aware of the protocol):\\n1.      State \u201cAttribution Check.\u201d\\n\\n2.      Briefly identify the particular information about which you have interest, or information.\\n\\n \\n Commitments\\n \\n- Check in with self about origins of information before sharing it. \\n- Provide attribution whenever possible when sharing information.\\n- Do not be defensive when someone questions your sources of information, or invokes Attribution Check with you.\\n- Do not assume ill will or deception if someone has not attributed sources. \\n- Do not be excessively concerned with murky areas of idea origination, unless your goal is academic.\\n-Be respectful and pleasant if offering Attribution Check to another. Support is the goal, not attack.\\n- Offer known sources of information if communicator seems unaware of precedents.\\n \\nNotes\\n \\n- If a precedent to the information presented is revealed, or a source of the information presented discovered, that updated knowledge the original communicator should share said information as appropriate with the audience with whom they originally communicated the information.\\n\\n(c\/c) - this protocol has been co-created so far by venessa miemis, jim mccarthy & michele mccarthy\",\"message_tags\":{\"174\":[{\"id\":\"745200944\",\"name\":\"Jim Mccarthy\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":174,\"length\":12}],\"189\":[{\"id\":\"746613035\",\"name\":\"Michele McCarthy\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":189,\"length\":16}]},\"link\":\"http:\/\/liveingreatness.com\/the-core-protocols.html\",\"name\":\"The Core Protocols\",\"caption\":\"www.liveingreatness.com\",\"description\":\"Copyright \u00a9 2010 Jim and Michele McCarthy (The Core is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/247613925326369\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/247613925326369\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-26T13:03:09+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-27T05:15:36+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"752701505\",\"name\":\"Dan RD\"},{\"id\":\"14935\",\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTQ5MzU=\",\"before\":\"NzUyNzAxNTA1\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"247626168658478\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\",\"id\":\"14935\"},\"message\":\"A great idea!\\n\\nMechanicalTurk.com, Vworker.com, Guru.com and dozens of other freelance markets now have over a million global teleworkers looking for microjobs each day.  \\n\\nNext Edgers could such markets to engage new talent in Attribution Checks.

I proposed for design a COLAB STUDIO where participants move around and jointly create \\\"products\\\" for cyberspace and interact with other teams in other colab studios. The Internet will permit communities with such different cultures (that they would not want to physically meet) yet be able to relate as functional components of a global humanity. My concern is that our access to cyberspace may soon be severely limited and we need a crash program to design alternatives (beyond what FNF is working on).\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-30T07:15:06+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"228929040528191\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"id\":\"1120956519\"},\"message\":\"Kevin - RIGHT....we are social and we've over corrected...but we are also utterly singular.... both\/and.

Zertify is a tiny app that replaces the analog resume with two digital resumes - one for the job and one for the jobber.  Matches can then be machine enabled by entrepreneurs such as those at VWorker, etc.  That's our best guess right now.  Everything else like feedback, vetting, payments, etc are not part of Zertify.  Its only an analog to digital converter from which social entrepreneurs can re-write the algorithms.  That is enough, I believe, to flip the old game over on it's head.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T21:53:18+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"246865048734590\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Caroline Smalley\",\"id\":\"1385101876\"},\"message\":\"Thanks Mark, I posted your comment on Suhrid's post.

Specifically, might it be realistic to look for investment in off-grid community power plants to be returned as local currency redeemable for energy at a discount rather than a direct energy dividend?\\n\\nThis sounds to me very similar to the Power Purchase Agreement that is the foundation for power plant financing in the U.S., from regional to business scale.  But if I understand you correctly, with kWhrs as the unit of account the currency is stabilized because of the absolute value, compared to using a monetary unit that leaves the unit of account vulnerable to changes in the value of the monetary unit.  This might  then be especially attractive to investors where monetary inflation is high because it protects their investment from that loss.  Thus, we might eliminate the effectively usurious interest on microloans at the community level in India, for example, because our monetary unit is redeemable in locally produced energy.  With this approach, the power station could issue its own scrip in exchange for the national currency from investors at face value, financing construction and promising the discount after a certain period adequate to accomplish development of its plant.\\n\\nOver time, the local currency would gain value against the national currency due to national inflation, but the face value of the local currency could remain pegged to the national currency with the energy discount adjusted to compensate.  For example, if the national currency looses 10% in value due to inflation, resulting in a 10% increase in the price of energy nationally, the local kWh currency remains pegged to the national currency but the discount on energy rises 10.1%.  In this way, the scrip could be used locally alongside national currency without any general confusion, while investors enjoy the absolute stability of the unit of account.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T22:11:13+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"246726172081811\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Chris Cook\",\"id\":\"671176264\"},\"message\":\"Kevin Parcell\\n\\nAstute comment.\\n\\nIt is at the local level at which I am looking for prototypes, and one of the problems - as you have correctly identified - is that of energy market middlemen.\\n\\nThat is to say, that if production can only be sold to a wholesaler at his bid price, and yet the 'market' price generally is at the wholesalers offer price, then project financing of 'selling production forward' is severely handicapped.\\n\\nFor an island; or for a 'stranded' community able to install a 'private wire'; or maybe one which owns its own utility, then the result is different.\\n\\nThe interesting thing is that investment in energy saving 'nega watts' - through the use of energy loans denominated in KwH or heat loans (hot water CHP) denominated in MMbtu - may take place now, with investors receiving a return denominated in energy, as individuals (or groups of them) who have invested in energy savings repay the loan by repurchasing units at the market price through their utility bill, but fund this payment out of savings.\\n\\nYou also clearly understand that the great advantage of this model over the conventional model is that:\\n\\n(a) no money is paid for the use of money- ie there is no compound interest, although there could be a return if units are sold at a discount to the energy market price;\\n\\n(b) to the extent that units circulate as currency and are not returned, there is an interest free loan, and the community benefits from 'seigniorage'.\\n\\nFor investors, units maintain their value in energy terms, and constitute a 'hedge against inflation' relative to the dollar and any other fiat currency.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"1392977680\",\"name\":\"Kevin Parcell\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":13}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T22:40:30+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"246734085414353\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Kevin Parcell\",\"id\":\"1392977680\"},\"message\":\"Chris Cook P.s. ...with the additional advantage that the scrip gains local demand as inflation increases the discount.

The scenario featured the publication in 1975 of a book that was to be  collaboratively, improved and expanded on successive years. It called for talented creatives to take the skeleton scenario and compose narratives and screenplays to flesh-out and make tangible what life would be like during the emergence of the societal butterfly -- including sketches of how the societal caterpillar (global civilization) would be replaced, not transformed. Unfortunately my publisher went bankrupt and I went on to other projects (another story for another time). Future history remains a powerful genre, one a person like myself, without narrative creating skills, can use.\\n\\nI believe a visionary goal state is insufficient to motivate appropriate action: although designing alternative goal states is an essential enterprise.  Today, people also need realistic scenarios, even though we can't yet program long-term future action. We need multiple, alternative scenarios.  My scenario in 1975 had mainframes, but I had not anticipated the PC or cyberspace. We now have the easy potential to build appropriate platforms to create living futures worlds to both engage and facilitate uplift.\\n\\nOne mode would be collaborative composing of simulated newspaper reports of events along scenarios. There also could be simulated articles representative of popular magazines or journals.  A scenario\/narrative \\\"Wikipedia\\\". We might start with selections from contemporary genres and insert content relevant to futures and demonstrating appropriate behaviors. The challenge is to make them attractive dramas.  I imagine soap operas and other TV genres showing people interacting at different points along the scenario -- which could include demonstrations for learning.  With current TV programming being replaced by cyberspace access, whole, simulated TV  \\\"channels\\\" could be created to capture TV viewers. Involving all participants in emergence as contributors to creating our virtual future could be a powerful integrating and educational process. Narratives should range from those to attract those not yet committed to emergence to those \\\"old hands\\\" at the frontiers.\\n\\nCan talented narrative creatives be motivated to compose to a scenario that is not \\\"theirs\\\", but  comes from scenario teams? This should not be viewed as Soviet style imposed propaganda. The narrative composers should feel that the scenarios are also theirs and many will want to be part of scenario creation.\\nTechnology for handling alternative and branching scenarios is a challenge.\\n\\nCare will be needed to handle potentially disruptive controversy.  A family of scenarios and narratives should focus on the emergnce of new systems without an oppressive environment, as is quite possible for emergence that doesn't have the objective of challenging and reforming the dying caterpillar. Presenting emergence without the endgame of transformation is essential to optimize human attention. This also might demonstrate how this can be done without being overly dependent on the caterpillar (such as seeking funding); but not being so purist as not to utilize needed resources.  But, we also need alternative scenarios of how the emergent societal butterfly engages the decaying societal caterpillar. Here we cannot shrink from facing real dangers a panicked caterpillar presents, and what the emerging butterfly must do to minimize potentially critical problems.  A problem here may be that many working on emergence have properly insulated themselves from most of the detailed ugly news of collapse - and from what they do learn from what they do read they may dismiss the seriousness of consequences of oppression and collapse.  Scenarios must explore alternative endgames without triggering oppressive reaction. Although many people may repress consideration of the endgame of Emergence and Civilization, with all the dangers (highlighted in many videos, where ads can't be ignored), it cannot not effect them.\\n\\nA critical scenario is how our emergence will continue when our access to broadband and some of cyberspace is limited. We must sharply distinguish between the power of local networked computers and the additional power arising from the ability of these local networks to rapidly communicate broadband. At minimum we must have workable scenarios to Pony Express Flash-drives. These should be in place before access to The Internet is curtailed.\\n\\nOther paths: 1) Simulations of emergence\/replacement in virtual worlds such as Second Lifee; 2) Educational  expedition\/tours through cyberspace, some using programs such as Camstasia to record online activity for guided viewing; 3) Scenarios for caterpillar reform should not be excluded; although the whole societal butterfly cannot be transformed from the societal caterpillar, some parts can be reformed to facilitate butterfly emergence: 4)  Scenarios are needed to illustrate how our physical infrastructure must be utilized during emergence and later transformed; what cannot be transformed during societal metamorphosis is the societal or institutional structures\/practices of civilization. These must be replaced. By the time our emergence has reached the strength to force transformation on civilizational structures it will be both easier and better to continue our own emergence and replace the caterpillar.\\n\\nPersonal development will be essential and we must be open and aware to our real personal struggles with necessary personal change, even personal metamorphosis. The system may facilitate personal biographies of those who are personally emerging, as well as fictional persons in narrative.  This ties with the current concerns of Venessa on her EmergentbyDesign blog. How individuals can disengage from their addiction to civilization dependent lifestyles (e.g. being entertained, consuming) is a critical challenge to the success of emergence. This I can personally attest to.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T23:40:43+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MjQ2NzU1NTQ4NzQ1NTQw\",\"before\":\"MjQ1MDk3MTg4OTExMzc2\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_246736138747481\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"DK Matai\",\"id\":\"1059226035\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"The essence of forgiveness is cosmic reciprocity: forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us!\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/246736138747481\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/246736138747481\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-24T23:00:16+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-24T23:00:16+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_246433495444412\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Fabio Barone\",\"id\":\"674787130\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"http:\/\/www.triumphofcommons.com \\\"Those who see the world as a battleground revel in what they\u2019ve made impossible for others.

Design Science. Efficiency. Technics. Creating more usable wealth using less resources and less energy. For exampe, if the open-source car people succeed in getting their 100mpg to market, you will have a car that last 30 years, and gets more than twice the mpg as todays cars. If everyone transitioned to these types of technologies, the net economic growth would be *negative* as traditionally measured - since it would be less profit for propierary corporations, less resouces\/energy consumed, less cars bought (since they will last longer), etc. This can and will apply across an increasingly large segment of the economy going forward - see 'System D'. So in this instance the economy will \\\"shrink\\\" but quality of life will grow.\\n\\n2) Peak Oil does not mean Peak Energy - not to mention increases in overall efficiency and localized production of both energy and goods. Claims that it will cost increasingly large segments of the economic pie to transition over renewables is not backed up by any data, anywhere. Additionally with greater localization there is significant drop in energy used by the economy as a whole, not to mention increasing ability to do more with less energy. So you get more real wealth and prosperity, and less energy usage. Based on numerous metrics this could look like an economic contraction, but in reality it is increased prosperity for everyone - less resources, more actuall utility.\\n\\n3) Increased technological prowess at the local level - desktop manufacturing, rapid global adoption of innovative breakthroughs through instand uploading\/downloading of the latest designs, desktop MEMS.\\n\\n4) Regenerative Technologies - the ability to reuse and\/or use resources that are renewable and\/or breakdown into basic biodegradable components after use.

I want to focus attention on the integration of insights so we can build toward a viable set of solutions.)\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the issue of apathetic shutdown is very dire indeed.

So we can safely assume that they will not be able to find adequate solutions in their state of mind.\\n\\nWhat we need instead is an emphasis on human psycho-social resilience -- namely a systematic understanding of human creativity, collaboration, and innovation -- if we want to paint a picture of the transition that is both empirically plausible (and sober about the scale of threats) and yet empowering and evocative for bridge builders to a better future.\\n\\nIt is here that we can begin to see the role of futurists who specialize in design science.  We have a special responsibility to convey hopeful images of a desirable future that people can see themselves in concretely.  I tend to focus on conversations that matter and evocation of paradigm elements that show promise of getting us into a different financial system globally.

We are working extensively on this matter with the development and deployment of The Value Game at Ingenesist, Social Flights, and various clients. The idea is that if you find the right asset, and then find the right set of people with diverse interest that are dependent on the asset, they will then interact with each other to preserve the asset.

In the military there can be that kind of competition, and in sports teams too. My answer would be: Find a group that has the characteristics that you are looking for, model that group, and build a group that fits the model. Family systems therapy, there's another example.. Think of Virginia Satir, Psychodrama, Systemic Constellations, Gregory Bateson, Milton Erickson, NLP\u00af the Palo Alto School.. Find a healthy group, with whatever kind of \\\"fitness\\\" you are looking for, model it, and apply rules to build that kind of group.. MIT Media Lab is another great example people compete there in a healthy way, challenge one another.. What Sabine Amend says too is fundamental.. game mechanics.. playing.. That's really key I think if you want to be challenged. But I've learned to challenge myself because I've never been accepted in any group, nor was able to get people to follow me in my endeavors.. I'm neither a leader nor a follower, more of a hermit, detached, isolated from the world..

A study of capitalism reveals something quite remarkable.  The condition of scarcity, real of contrived, (i.e. adversity) motivates people to act in certain ways; they do improve themselves, they go to college and innovate, raise families, and especially, they borrow money (capitalize things), etc.  The problem that many are grappling with, including myself and perhaps even Seb Paquet with his desire to improve is that there is no longer an incentive to improve because the game has been gamed.  No matter how hard you work, or study, or practice discipline, one does not improve (no place to practice improvement).

The Invisible Hand is still to this day by far my favorite concept, not just favorite, but the one that amazes me the most. My favorite renderings are by Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman (minus the monetarism, though, that's going too far for my taste). As for the rest, I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, I also am disciplined to the point of self-mortification. I am a workaholic in other words, and my work is by definition self-improvement, i.e. I am an artist, perfecting my craft is my mission on earth.\\n\\nWhat you say about improvement and incentives doesn't apply to me, or perhaps I'm not understanding correctly. I am a highly motivated person, always full of enthusiasm, I love big challenges.. I work well in groups, groups of all kinds, I adapt quickly and effectively to circumstances, adverse or not adverse, I never experience fatigue, I'm the happiest I've ever been and get happier every day.. I only see solutions, no problems.. I am constantly inspired, I work well at rest and under duress too, there's no stress-test I can't handle, I have clear thoughts and extreme amounts of concentration..\\n\\nBut I have weaknesses, and when I work to improve myself, I work on my weaknesses (I believe in working on my weaknesses first, rather than focusing only on my strengths). Some of those weaknesses are biological, some are just parts of myself I don't like, or behaviors I don't like.. I mean what kind of improvement are we talking about here, self-improvement or are we talking about competencies in a professional sense? Cause I have a growing number of incentives to improve professionally too.. opportunities abound..\\n\\nI'm kind of fed up of hearing people complain about their problems.. I wasn't born motivated and proficient in anything, I was born with major neurological disadvantages.. I had every learning disability you can think of.. Adversity is my friend, it has made me who I am, has made me stronger.. I don't think adversity is necessary, though, I get what you're saying in part, I think.. Which game are you talking about when you said it was gamed?\\n\\nThis conversation is nonsense unless we define the terms we are using, unless we articulate what it is we're talking about.. I still don't know what the \\\"game\\\" is that we're trying to \\\"up\\\".. is it baseball? is it a fictitious game like the Prisoner's Dilemma? is it Chess? is it a human courtship ritual, or \\\"game\\\" as in the sexual marketplace? I love games, I love playing them, theorizing them I love even more.. But for all the games I play, all the games I think about, my profession is not a game..\\n\\nSurvival is not a game for me, everything else is, but putting food on the table isn't a game, I wish I didn't have to be best of breed in what I do.. But since I have no choice, I chose to enjoy every aspect of it, and I began by choosing a trade that suited who I was, which conformed to my profound aspirations.. and I spent 30+ years solving the problem of emotional intelligence, mental endurance, concentration, stress, fatigue, etc., the things I saw were setting people back in every aspect of life..\\n\\nYou want to solve problems of a Global scope? Start by working on yourself, be a happier, stronger person, the Invisible Hand works that way too, if we were all a little more satisfied, a little less frustrated, a little bit happier in our lives, you would see half the world's problems vanish into thin air.. Individuals are unhappy, that's partly how we get \\\"the governments we deserve\\\".. People are trying to solve the world's problems, but they haven't done the emotional labor, the hard stuff in the \\\"basement\\\" (as Sylvester Stalone so brilliantly put in his last Rocky movie).\\n\\nI think the term \\\"cooperation\\\" should be retired indefinitely.. I want to hear more about \\\"Coopetition\\\".. the \\\"Frenemy\\\".. I want to hear about Sur\/Petition (btw have you read that book by Edward de Bono? You would love it, Dan. I want to here more about \\\"pro-cooperative games\\\", and non-cooperative games, too, which in game theory for some reason still hasn't been studied with the same rigor as cooperative games (in many instances), almost as though we didn't want to study the \\\"ugly\\\" stuff. For some reason we think we can cooperate our way out of every problem, but that is a very limited worldview. I learned that in part from Robert D. Kaplan's book Warrior Politics: Why Leadership Demands a Pagan Ethos, which funny enough was published right after 9\/11.. It's funny that we haven't really come to terms with Asymmetric Warfare, like it's some freaking mystery.. meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War was a prime example of asymmetric warfare.. go figure..\\n\\nI think humans agree too much with one another, in general. Why are people afraid to use the word \\\"debate\\\" or \\\"argument\\\"? Why do we feel we have to be \\\"nice\\\" to everybody, like that's going to change the world? Meanwhile people all over the world are planning day and night different ways of killing us en masse. If they could, they would nuke us in one fell swoop.

One of my own weaknesses, I will admit, is an attitude problem. My stance tends to be pessimistic. I tend to underestimate people. I lack trust. I am not forgiving (the general rule is one strike you're out - with no possibility of redemption). That's who I am, though, and I try to make the best of it. I could easily not participate in public discussions or social networking, or not have friends in the real-world \/ offline, and not spend quality time with family. In fact, for 20 years, I did exactly that (granted for part of that the online part was not applicable). What is funny though, is that I underestimate certain things in people while other aspects I overestimate. I tend to think that people's attitudes are much better than mine, that they are much nicer people, have much more good will, are much more altruistic and likely to cooperate, are much more positive in general, they value things like friendship, are generous, like to share, etc., many of which are qualities that I don't have (or is it a mask \/ defence mechanism to hide behind this \\\"antiface\\\" for fear that people get to know me intimately, and find out that I am actually tenderhearted, gentle, and a genuinely \\\"nice guy\\\"?)  I believe people are innately \/ inherently good. I'm also optimistic when it comes to the future. I'm not scared about the future, I think it's going to be great for more and more of us, greater and greater too. But I wasn't supposed to see what I saw, I apologize. Thanks, in any case. I'm still going to try to find flaws in people's arguments, cause the sooner I can loosen out the bottom of the bag, the quicker they will lose their marbles (assuming they had a paper bag full of marbles and I moistened the bottom of the bag enough that the marbles all fell out, whatever that means). I can't speak for Dan Robles though, he uses the word \\\"abundance\\\" and that scares me.

They do this in part because they don't feel they can \\\"level up\\\" so easily\/clearly in life. This then leads edgers to gamify stuff that matters: jane mcgonigal writes about this in her book reality is broken, and a friend of mine who owns some smaller game companies has done a number of projects with jane  for the NYC library and a few others, trying to get folks gaming 10,000 hours in something that matters.

Design Science. E...fficiency. Technics. Creating more usable wealth using less resources and less energy. For exampe, if the open-source car people succeed in getting their 100mpg to market, you will have a car that last 30 years, and gets more than twice the mpg as todays cars. If everyone transitioned to these types of technologies, the net economic growth would be *negative* as traditionally measured - since it would be less profit for propierary corporations, less resouces\/energy consumed, less cars bought (since they will last longer), etc. This can and will apply across an increasingly large segment of the economy going forward - see 'System D'. So in this instance the economy will \\\"shrink\\\" but quality of life will grow.\\n\\n2) Peak Oil does not mean Peak Energy - not to mention increases in overall efficiency and localized production of both energy and goods. Claims that it will cost increasingly large segments of the economic pie to transition over renewables is not backed up by any data, anywhere. Additionally with greater localization there is significant drop in energy used by the economy as a whole, not to mention increasing ability to do more with less energy. So you get more real wealth and prosperity, and less energy usage. Based on numerous metrics this could look like an economic contraction, but in reality it is increased prosperity for everyone - less resources, more actuall utility.\\n\\n3) Increased technological prowess at the local level - desktop manufacturing, rapid global adoption of innovative breakthroughs through instand uploading\/downloading of the latest designs, desktop MEMS.\\n\\n4) Regenerative Technologies - the ability to reuse and\/or use resources that are renewable and\/or breakdown into basic biodegradable components after use.

So lets start with the \\\"facts\\\" they present:\\n\\nFILM: The world produces 10TW of energy per year, which is equal to 10,000 nuclear power plants. This means each nuclear plant has a power output of 100 MW.\\n\\nFACT: The average nuclear power plant produces 846MW, so their 10,000 figure is actually 1180 plants, assuming they use 1960s technology. Average output of new nuclear power plants today is 1500MW, reducing their 10,000 figure to 700. \\n\\nFILM: All the worlds installed solar power installed is equal to 2 coal fired plants.\\n\\nFACT: Installed world solar power as of 2011 is over 60GW. Average coal fired plant is 667MW. This is equivalent to 90 coal plants. They are off by a factor of 45!! Italy installed 7.5GW of solar power in 2011 alone! Equal to 12 coal fired plants! Using their \\\"exponential bacteria\\\" argument against them - a very conservative solar growth rate of just 20% doubles every 3 years! Please see my analysis here: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/120497731371323\/242307489190346\/?ref=notif&notif_t=group_activity#!\/notes\/paul-hughes\/solar-could-power-the-entire-world-by-2030\/489461108575\\n\\nTwo other major \\\"facts\\\" they use to push their, \\\"there is no tomorrow\\\" agenda is, \\\"coal MAY [my emphasis] peak in 2040\\\", and \\\"natural gas MAY peak in 2030\\\". Does this mean I think those two sources are good? No, but it does mean very long time scales for a transition, especially considering that only 1.6% of U.S. energy comes from petroleum (their fact not mine).\\n\\nFILM: It requires (i.e. there is no alternative) 4 times as much coal energy to produce 1 solar panel. \\n\\nFACT: Solar panels last 40 years and produce over 10 times the energy in their lifetime than it was required to make them. And solar panels can be made without using any traditional energy source - see here: http:\/\/www.physorg.com\/news\/2010-12-sahara-aims-power-world.html\\n\\n*This a bootstrapping project, with new solar panels being made from energy of the solar power already installed from previous iterations.\\n\\nI could go on for hours like this deconstructing every \\\"fact\\\" this film uses to push their fear mongering.

However, the light may reveal aspects about ourselves (including myself) that must change. We are all as children emerging to greater competencies without adults to emulate, and are challenged to advance rapidly to survive\/thrive. I am not an exemplar of what we are to become; but my disabilities gives me insight to what we currently lack.\\n\\nOur real potential for very significant and fundamental change may be much greater than we imagine, even for those most optimistic.  I am not consciously aware of this awesome potential, as I am limited in imagining as everyone else. What I propose is that we have the potential to transcend the limitations of individualism and -- at the same time - greatly enhance the contribution of each unique person to our collective future.\\nI grok many different populations working on themes relevant to our survival\/thrival.  At any moment I am aware of only a few. I also observe a too slow building of mutual awareness, collaboration, and synergy between these diverse populations. The potential is there in the new technology, but there appears (to me) a large gap between the explicit visions of these distinct populations and the good-feeling-but-naive \\\"ultimate vision\\\".  I am not aware of any serious work on alternative endgames. Not that we are ready for programming endgames, but that consideration of endgames may reveal critical themes that are missing populations working on them.  We need much greater feedback between longer-term, whole-system future-ing and practical nitty-gritty action.\\n\\nEvery person has talents and limitations, as does every team and every community. We complement to achieve what individuals cannot independently achieve.  Yet, may it be that we - at our best - are far from achieving our potential to provide mutual aide and to collaborate? Do we adequately comprehend the tension between the practicality of \\\"doing\\\" and the imaginative-future-ing required to face our contemporary challenges, that may be (dangerously) slowing our progress?\\n\\nAs an exercise, consider that, in retrospect after the endgame, we would identify 100 major themes critical for the manifestation of successful survival\/thrival. Of those 100, in 2012 only 80 have populations attending to those themes.  If any of these 80 populations in 2012 were asked to list relevant themes, each would -- after facilitated exploration - cite only about 40. Different populations would cite a different 40, and some would cite more and some less. Of the 40 themes cited, most populations would indicate less than 10 as really critical; that if these 10 were attended to, the others would come along. Many populations would indicate only a few. There are well known psychological and sociological reasons for this. What magnitude of effort is required by the magnitude of our challenge?\\n\\n    It is well known that most decision-makers are unaware of or ignore reliable knowledge that would drastically effect the situation. What we are not aware of is that activist populations are also ignoring relevant knowledge that might significantly impact what they intend to achieve.  This knowledge is usually outside the domain of expertize of the activists.  Example: no activist (even activists in education) apply to themselves processes that would greatly improve their competencies. We all grossly underestimate our own potential for change, and indirectly underestimate the real potential for others to change.\\n\\nThe collective knowledge of humankind is far vaster than anyone imagines. Beyond the recorded knowledge in diverse archives is the tacit knowledge within the mind-brains of billions of persons; and we can rapidly develop the technology to access this knowledge.  There are ways of rapidly and significantly uplifting the distribution of cognitive competencies of human populations, expanding both tacit knowledge and access to the archives. However, due to wide-spread limited imaginations to non-magical means of \\\"education\\\" most act as if the distribution of cognitive competencies for most people will not significantly change until after successful survival\/thrival. Indeed, few of the most imaginative, most informed, and most active imagine themselves changing radically. We expect improvement, and maybe new skills and understandings, but we don't imagine many major paradigm shifts ourselves - the kinds of shifts we expect of others.\\n\\nA technique that emerged for me is to move back and forth between my envisioning of a successful endgame (achieving a state where the future seems secure) and a hard look at the complexities of the Here&Now - and many stages that must occur between.  In 1975 (before the personal computer and The Internet) I created a future-history scenario, MISSION-2000, where the endgame was achieved in 25 years. In 2012 with our new technologies and knowledge I can envision a scenario to endgame in 10-15 years. I recognize that this seems quite miraculous, without looking at my reasoning and evidence.  One of my metaphors for this is SEE (Synergistic Emergent Eruption).  I use the massive change symbolized by an eruption to say that the changes in SEE will be positive of the same magnitude as nuclear winter would be negative.  SEE can be viewed as analogous to the emergence of a societal butterfly from the collapsing societal caterpillar - which is NOT a transformation of caterpillar to butterfly but the rapid emergence from many societal imaginal buds once the threshold for synergy is crossed.  Crossing this threshold will not occur \\\"naturally\\\" - as in evolution - but via active human co-creativity. It is our challenge to weave the societal butterfly and not wait for it to happen \\\"naturally\\\". However, we must also not be arrogant to assume that we in 2012 know what to do - rather, we have the ability \\\"to learn what it takes to learn what we should learn, and learn it\\\".

All I can say, though, is that it's pretty complicated. There's no simple way to put it. It has to do in part with inline linking and display rights. Pinterest could be liable if they save a copy of the image on their servers, or just because they are enabling or inciting others to infringe. The content sites might not like the new placement. Perceived meaning can be changed through an unapproved context. There have been many cases in the US but there doesn't seem to be precedents for a site like Pinterest. Inline links are HTML instructions which are lines of text and not a photographic image. I mean the more you think about it the more you realize how complex this case is. A lot of it has to do with Pinterest making money off of potential infringement by its users. Again, it enables me to do so, providing the tools.

We can only act on behalf of something with which we feel connected to (including ourselves).   So how can we create an environment that is designed from this worldview while we are not yet living it? It is, of course a leap of faith that is necessary in our transformation. With that said, we need a strategy. It is also foolish to solely exist in this paradigm, for your sustainability runs the risk of ceasing to exist. So can we do this incrementally? Or should we? Perhaps the leap of faith will catch us and in the process we will more wholly become the regenerative agents we moving toward becoming. \\n\\nBut even if our actions are transitional and not transformational, our worldview must speak to the highest aspirations of humanity. And in that, we must acknowledge the contributions to the whole as serving both the whole AND the parts. This understanding is, of course, at the marrow of the transformation.\\n\\nEven in the eloquent piece by Matanovic, he has regenerated the community and the community has sustained him - but still through sale, not gift.  The creative space that was unlocked within him through offering his work will facilitate more work, but without the sale, it will generate not food, nor shelter, nor oil paints, nor canvas.

I don't believe there is a single defining world-view at the moment, or at any given time. I see the trend, a great number of people share a similar world-view, but this group is by far a very small minority in the world.\\n\\nThe world we live in is characterized by complexity, I can agree with that. Gift economies though disappeared as our societies grew more complex. I don't think it's a viable option anymore. To me, the economy that best \\\"answers all of these seemingly contradictory questions\\\" is free market capitalism, non-interventionist, democratic capitalism, which doesn't currently actually exist anywhere, nor was it ever really implemented properly or given a fighting chance.\\n\\nI think we tend to romanticize the life of the Paleolithic \\\"hunter-gatherers\\\". Our era is still characterized by much segregation, maybe even more now than ever.\\n\\nTwo statements made little sense to me, that \\\"We are all one\\\" and that \\\"Life is abundant\\\". We are by definition, \\\"not one\\\". Inanimate matter and empty space are much more abundant than life. I really can't condone \\\"expressing oneself wildly\\\". If anything, we need much restraint in our communications and self-expressions. In art, working under severe constraints is not only the norm, it's how one exhibits one's proficiency and skill.\\n\\nI don't see a pattern in the evolution of man from the Paleolithic era to the present. The Paleolithic spans millions of years. The world as we know it is extremely young in comparison. We tend to be amazed at the \\\"accelerating pace\\\" of modern technological advances. We've come a long way from stone tools, but in comparison the jump from no tools to stone tools is much greater. The former is a change in degree, the latter a change in kind. Once you start making tools, it's a different story altogether.\\n\\nBut information sharing, mobility, a detailed understanding of ecological processes and environmental inputs, the creation of deep knowledge, now that I can agree with!

I think I'll respond - not in the spirit of debate, but because I hope you and I will continue this conversation and others, and I'd feel eager to share my impression that we have more views in common than it may have seemed.\\n\\n* I've found several pieces of convincing research about the superior happiness of modern-day hunter-gatherer societies.  But of course, no one knows about Paleolithic emotions.\\n* I agree, there is no single worldview. But there is a trend that we can identify, as you've said.  And yes, that emerging worldview is still a small minority. But it stands to be very influential (if things don't fall apart first). \\n* In the article, I'm trying to say that we have to expand our definition of \\\"gift economy\\\" so that we're not only talking about hunter-gatherer-style sharing...so that it can include capitalism (probably in some evolved form)...so that it can accommodate today's complexity.  To me, it's not about free sharing.  It's about expanding the underlying philosophy of our economic activities. \\n* I agree that there's too much romanticizing of the hunter-gatherers. That's part of why I wrote this - I was sick of people saying we should go back to those \\\"good old days.\\\"  But I do think there's something valuable we can bring forward and adapt to our reality.\\n* Yes, still much segregation.  Again, I'm pointing out a trend.  And moving into an era of integration doesn't mean segregation ends - to me, healthy segregation feeds necessary divergence. \\n* It's hard for me to respond to the rest of what you've written because there I think we just have different views of the world. Maybe a night's sleep will help me!\\n* Thanks very much for the kind compliment about my writing - yours is certainly not \\\"maladroit\\\"!

I guess I could have easily realized that you weren't saying \\\"Let's all become hunter-gatherers!\\\" and that you were trying to \\\"unwrap\\\" the gift economy, not lay out a master plan to eradicate all forms of capitalism. I'm very much a Crusader when it comes to beliefs about art and economics. I myself fit the stereotype a little too closely of the \\\"crazy starving artist\\\". In the context of art - which is in essence my only true area of expertise - there definitely exists several key elements of the \\\"gift economies\\\" of old. So if what you were saying was that we need to \\\"rethink\\\" the underlying concepts of gift economies, then I'm in complete agreement with you. Dan Robles 's work on Social Capitalism and the concepts involved, I think, can help give us a kind of \\\"Roadmap\\\", if you will, for what we might want the future of \\\"capitalism\\\" to look like. Yochai Benkler too, has written brilliantly on commons-based peer production and the \\\"wealth of networks\\\", and Don Tapscott's books Wikinomics and Macrowikinomics are must-read material for our times, i.e. the networked information economy. One thing you said really struck a chord with me. You mentioned the \\\"seemingly contradictory questions\\\". I've taken the very contradictory, paradoxical nature of these problems for granted. Upon reading your article, it occurs to me how important it is to recognize that about our \\\"times\\\". It doesn't mean the problems we face are \\\"un-solvable\\\"; contradictions and paradoxes are not insurmountable, they just push us to to find better answers and to innovate. I'm always open to discussing these things. To me the word \\\"debate\\\" is not a bad word. Debating to me just means sharing our different points of view and trying to find \\\"common ground\\\".

Most organizations don't want to change but they are also desperate to be seen as changing, they don't want to be perceived as falling behind. Most consultancies are eager to gain revenues and thus don't really want to push organizations beyond their comfort zones. But they too also want to be seen as absolutely cutting edge. Somehow these two independent dynamics create the perfect dance team. The organization can justify it ethically in their mind because society does need much of what they do so it's OK if they produce it at 60% of what it could be. The consultancy can justify it ethically in their minds because they can help the organization move from 60 to 65%, and that is an improvement after all.

It will be developed using Tribler's 'kernel' Dispersy. This deployment is being coordinated by Johan Pouwelse, development coordinator.\\n\\nContacts with other groups such as Lorea, Diaspora and FGA - and now with the World Free Media Forum as well - brought the possibility to work on a global RDF vocabulary in order to build a data federation among the different current - and future - projects in the same conceptual field of TheGlobalSquare. This federation is being coordinated by Ed Knutson, development coordinator.\\n\\nOur http:\/\/wiki.theglobalsquare.org is growing, users start to work and develop ideas together in a genuine and empowered wiki fashion! In matters of press coverage, our project was aimed in the following works and more are to be published. Heather Marsh, conceptual coordinator and spokesperson is managing inquiries and building the wiki.\\n\\nApril arrives and TheGlobalSquare was invited to take part in Berlin Biennale as a major experiment of occupy movement in the field of cybernetics, as a global hackaton is planed to be held as well as other announcements. It is proposed to be an open space for people to practice the concepts of our project, the spirit of occupations, not only destined to coding. Carolina Garcia, general coordinator, is taking care of this subject in order to provide the necessary connections so this event will be able to provide participants with a decentralized and plural micro-social-environment to reinvent the world; people from different squares, projects, groups and assemblies will be able to take part in the adventure!\\n\\nNEW VOLUNTEERS WHO JOINED THE LIST THIS WEEK: PRESENT YOURSELF SO YOU CAN BE CONTACTED BY COORDINATORS!

Technologically these 2 systems are almost opposite in approach - TGS P2P wants to keep your information off of any server, TGS Federation wants to get all your information on every server :p So some discussion required, but both seem very necessary at this point.\\n\\nTGS Systems: Once we have the individuals sorted and the communications set up, comes the third part. At the end of the day these are not just social tools, they are also working and organizing tools, and once we are together and talking we will want to build stuff. That would be the News Commons, the Global Market and so much more, which are topics for another day.\\n\\nWiki should be getting more clear this week as we hear from everyone and put it all together.\\n\\nAll the best,\\n\\nH.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-18T06:00:04+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MjQyMjgzMjc1ODU5NDM0\",\"before\":\"MjQyMjgzMjc1ODU5NDM0\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_242254165862345\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ruchira S.

That is because some 97 % of money is not cash (which can be used over and over without any payment of interest) but is bank-created credit-based money for which the economy, that is us, the producers and consumers, has to pay exponential interest.\\n\\nLet me explain. Banks mediate (and usurp) our own credit. We go to the bank because we \\\"need money\\\". The bank demands security (our house, our car, our income, our factory), it then calls that security a bank asset, and against that asset that is actually ours, not the bank's, it issues us \\\"credit\\\" = money. That money comes with a price called interest. \\n\\nThat would not be so bad if not 97% of all money in existence were created in this way. \\n\\nNow interest is not linear. It is compound. It follows an exponential growth curve. Try to figure out the exponential curve of a permanent loan the size of 97% of the total money supply and you will understand the full import and the appalling efficiency of that \\\"wealth pump\\\", which leaves us in a substantial vacuum.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-17T18:40:01+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"241964619224633\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Brad DeGraf\",\"id\":\"539588433\"},\"message\":\"I have what I think is a simpler explanation.

The point can be made even more clearly by noting a detail I\u2019ve brought up here before\u2014the curious fact that the 5% of humanity that live in the United States of America, until quite recently, used around a quarter of the world\u2019s energy and around a third of its raw materials and industrial product. This remarkably disproportionate share of the world\u2019s wealth didn\u2019t come to us because the rest of the world didn\u2019t want such things, or because the United States manufactured some good or provided some service so desirable to the rest of the world that other nations vied with each other to buy it from us. Quite the contrary; we produced very little in America during much of our empire\u2019s most prosperous period, and the rest of the world\u2019s population is by and large just as interested in energy, raw materials, and industrial product as we are.\\n\\nIt\u2019s considered distinctly impolite to suggest that the real reason behind the disparity is related to the fact that the United States has over 500 military bases on other nations\u2019 territory, and spends on its armed forces every year roughly the same amount as the military budgets of every other nation on Earth put together. Here again, though, the obvious explanation is the correct one. Between 1945 and 2008, the United States was the world\u2019s dominant imperial power, filling the same role in the global political system that Britain filled during its own age of empire, and while that imperial arrangement had plenty of benefits, by and large, they flowed in one direction only.\\n\\nWith this in mind, we can move to a meaningful definition of empire. An empire is an arrangement among nations, backed and usually imposed by military force, that extracts wealth from a periphery of subject nations and concentrates it in the imperial core. Put more simply, an empire is a wealth pump, a device to enrich one nation at the expense of others. The mechanism of the pump varies from empire to empire and from age to age; the straightforward exaction of tribute that did the job for ancient Egypt, and had another vogue in the time of imperial Spain, has been replaced in most of the more recent empires by somewhat less blatant though equally effective systems of unbalanced exchange. While the mechanism varies, though, the underlying principle does not.\\\"\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com\/2012\/02\/nature-of-empire.html\",\"name\":\"The Archdruid Report: The Nature of Empire\",\"caption\":\"thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/241202979300797\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/241202979300797\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-16T16:06:00+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-17T10:39:31+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"1381002634\",\"name\":\"Anthony Mainardi\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTM4MTAwMjYzNA==\",\"before\":\"MTM4MTAwMjYzNA==\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"241205372633891\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bruce Randolph Tizes\",\"id\":\"704660253\"},\"message\":\"it is, of course, true that the function of the government of the united states is to maintain and expand it's citizens disproportionate consumption of world resources... maintain a high standard of living.  it is not correct that the military apparatus is the most important piece of the strategy, but is a material part of the assertion of influence globally.  finally, the united states is not in decline notwithstanding the many reports in the media and water cooler conversation.\\nhttp:\/\/belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu\/files\/Chinas_Century.pdf\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-16T16:10:21+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"241211582633270\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\",\"id\":\"520685736\"},\"message\":\"The nationalism on display in U.S. foreign policy and that of most developed nations is no longer tenable, helpful, or ethical.\\n\\nThere are other people out there who are just as human as we are.

Systemic Risk Implications?\u201d \\n\\nWe would welcome your input in regard to draft 35 prior to official release.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nDKM\\n\\nIf Greece Defaults, Is The Cascading Shock Worse Than The Lehman Bankruptcy?  Systemic Risk Implications? Draft 35\\n\\n1.  Is the imminent Greece default just the tip of the iceberg?\\n\\n2.  Is there a lot more at stake in a potential Greek default than meets the eye at first glance?\\n\\n3.  Is the much bigger concern what happens in the Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets?\\n\\n4.  Greek sovereign debt Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are insurance policies, individually written, that basically say:  if Greece defaults, the CDS contract will compensate for what the sovereign should have.  Credit default swaps have grown exponentially over the last decade.  \\n\\n5.  No one knows: \\n\\n            i.  How big is the volume of CDS contracts?  How much CDS exposure is there on Greek debt?  It could be in multiples of actual Greek sovereign debt.  Since the CDS contracts are individually written, there is no clear visible record of how many CDS contracts are outstanding.    \\n\\n            ii.  Who are the counterparties? The two parties obviously know who the counter-party is but there is no public record that would allow a regulator or a third party to find out who was involved.  This causes a loss of trust during a financial shock and it is this precise problem that caused AIG to almost collapse in the wake of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008.\\n\\n            iii.  Worst of all, whether the CDS contracts will actually trigger in what many would consider a default?  News circulates that holders of CDS on Greek government bonds wouldn\u2019t receive payouts in the event Greece defaulted.  That decision raises questions about the value of such insurance-like contracts and exposes limitations of the so-called hedging strategies that banks and investors have relied on in the past.\\n\\n6.  If the swaps don\u2019t pay out when bonds default, what\u2019s the point of even hedging in the first place?\\n\\n7.  Without reliance on hedging, how will less credit-worthy players raise capital in the world markets?\\n\\n8.  Does this portend the end of modern capitalism as we know it:  either triggered by a collapse of the CDS derivatives pyramid or total lack of reliance on CDS going forwards thereby shutting access to capital for less than 100% creditworthy players?\\n\\n[ENDS]\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/241429389278156\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/241429389278156\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-16T22:35:45+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-16T22:35:45+0000\"},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_241415809279514\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Steve Brant\",\"id\":\"703220850\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"Jeremy Lin's talent was invisible to the \\\"professionals\\\" in his sport.

It accounts for their having always been born naked, helpless for months, and inexperienced - ergo, ignorant, hungry, thirsty, curious, and therefore fated to learn how to survive only through trial-and-error-won, progressive accumulation of experience. Class-one evolution accounted for humanity's all-unexpected invention of verbal (aural, sound) communication, and thereby the integration of the experience-won information of the many, whereby the integrated information of the many increased the capability of humanity at large to cope with the exigencies of life.

Here's a recent self-intro from his brand new blog: \\n\\n\\\"What interests me is the state of our world. So you can expect to see things on energy, on the economy, on politics, on transportation, and on social trends. I do think we are standing at or very near the precipice: much of what we\u2019ve institutionalised as \u201cthe way things are\u201d is about to break. I believe that twenty years from now we will be living very local lives, and so small neighbourhoods and communities will matter far more than they do today.

Let's take advantage of the enormous commitments that created the studies, as well as the UN and other major studies you and others have been spotting. Let's dust them off, correlate them with each other, and identify what parts of them people we can reach could adapt to the tools we have available today, and the potential economic opportunities as well.\\n\\nIf the national charrette, as I would call it, was similar to the San\\nFrancisco Bay Area project, which came out with a concrete growth plan for the Bay Area, there was probably substantial alignment on the seven reports, and it could possibly be adapted into a program and migration path for economic transformation.

I would only ask that you have compassion for the political limitations of his ability to act on what he knew (and on what the PCSD produced) at the time. This was a time in American political history when Al Gore - best known for his concern for planet Earth - felt he could not even run for president based on that belief.  In the 2000 election campaign, he kept all that to himself (much as Mitt Romney is currently not talking about his Morman beliefs, which are equally strong in my opinion).\\n\\nAmerica is a rather crazy place. Perhaps you are aware of these cultural dynamics \/ perhaps you aren't. (I note that you have spent some time here but don't live here.)  What I have learned is that - even if you are President of the United Sates - there is only so much you can do. (This is not like when JFK was president and the press chose not to report of the affairs he was having.)\\n\\nIf Clinton had signed Kyoto, he would have had a huge fight with Congress over ratifying it.  So, he chose not to have that fight.  Whether this was the right choice or not, at least he authorized a multi-year long planning effort which produced a plan which would have been capable of transforming the entire American culture... because it would have shifted our World View not just of the world out there but of how we relate to ourselves.  Adopting the principles of LIfelong Learning, Systems Thinking, etc... well, let's just say this was an idea whose time had not yet come in the 1990s but whose time has definitely come now (in my opinion as a student \/ advocate of societal transformation)...\\n\\nThanks again for pointing out what Bill Clinton didn't do.

What's more, not only does it exist -- but it exists nearby.  Just 7 blocks from where I live.\\n\\nAnd suppose that -- through various interactions in the broader community -- potlucks, art events, ..., -- I meet the people working on this dream society.\\n\\nAnd my question is:  How do I want this interaction to work?  What do I want them to say to me, and what do I want to say to them, and how do I want to hear them respond?  What kinds of things am I looking for, and how do I want to present myself, and how do I want to be presented to?\\n\\nMy ideals are very precious to me, after all.  How do I know that you actually share them?  How do I know that I can trust you?  How do I know that I'm not going to become a cog in your machine?  Suspicions about action and charisma are based in just exactly these questions, after all.  It is *very* personal;  It is the quintessence of personal.\\n\\nTrust isn't just a loose matter of \\\"lowering my guard,\\\" or convincing you to lower your guard.  Trust isn't a game of trickery or technique.  There's no way through but the hard way:  Mutual obedience to a higher middle.  The questions of power, money, reputation, ... all right there, in the center.\\n\\nSo I ask myself, \\\"How do I want to be approached?\\\"  If the dream society comes to me like the orb in Singularity Sky, I am obliterated.  If the dream society comes to me with a dream, and a vision, and a slot for me to fill, and a contract to fill -- I am lost.  If the dream society comes to me with a spitting image of my own values, and claims the ownership of them, or even just offers me \\\"a share\\\" in them -- then the relationship is horribly imbalanced.  It is so horribly imbalanced that even crude accusations of \\\"egotism\\\" and \\\"pettiness\\\" cannot move me to subservience.\\n\\nNow I remember the beauty of the oath I took at Damanhur.  Like everything at Damanhur, it was refined.  The phrase I remember was: \\\"I see my own face in this effort.\\\"  It captures my feeling exactly.  It is a star that guides my thinking.\\n\\nQuestions of rank and position are of high importance.  We should celebrate like brothers lost at sea and then reunited.  And we should argue like only best friends can do.  You and I need to come to a place of ideological clarity, and certainty that we have  each others backs.  When I am rich and famous, I will share everything with you, including the golden goose, because you are just as responsible as I am, the worlds' confusions be damned.  When you are rich and famous, you will share everything with me, including the golden goose itself, because I am just as responsible as you are, the worlds' confusions be damned.\\n\\nPeople say that these feelings and trusts cannot scale, but I don't believe it.  I have felt the solidarity rushing the airs at Damanhur, and I feel solidarities waiting trapped patiently at the inner door, whispering the location of the keys.\\n\\nSo how do I want to be approached?\\n\\nI want to be seen.  I want to be appreciated.  I want the doors of the people to be opened wide to me.  I want to be trusted, and I want to be tested:  I cannot trust you if you do not test me, I cannot trust you if we do not test one another.\\n\\nYour egotism is fine, if what I find in fact is that there is no deep wealth inequality:  A human being's pride is a fine thing, and my aim is not to break you.  I am much more bothered by appearances of humility, and a reality of subtle put vast power inequality...  So let freak flag can fly high, and show proudly.\\n\\nPerhaps above all, I want to hear you speak of your ideals.  I would like you to be King Arthur.  Lancelot and Guinevere are fine;  I am polyamorous myself.  But be a King Arthur, and I can never remorse myself for sitting at your noble and perfect round table.\\n\\nI want to be asked about the spirit of things, and brought in as an important person, even if I tremble, even if I am full of doubts and problems, even if I do not know what I am doing.\\n\\nThese are some of the ways I'll know that the society is near.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/230607087027053\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/230607087027053\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2012-02-01T16:57:09+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-02-10T03:46:24+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\"},{\"id\":\"4200992\",\"name\":\"Jenny Ryan\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"509034915\",\"name\":\"Rainer Wasserfuhr\"},{\"id\":\"571865313\",\"name\":\"Luke Stanley\"},{\"id\":\"660337950\",\"name\":\"Lynne Desilva-johnson\"},{\"id\":\"1224823408\",\"name\":\"Larry Victor\"},{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\"},{\"id\":\"2230985\",\"name\":\"Mark Dilley\"},{\"id\":\"674516612\",\"name\":\"John F Powers\"},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTIxMzAwMDMw\",\"before\":\"NzM5MDA4ODU5\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"231381093616319\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Larry Victor\",\"id\":\"1224823408\"},\"message\":\"Lion, I feel your concerns.

I propose that there are conceptual systems that cannot be experienced, cannot be part of an experiential moment, that we cannot be conscious of. Actually, most of what people talk about fits this category, yet we talk as if we experience it. I live in Tucson but I have never experienced Tucson, only what scene I am looking at during any moment. Looking down on Tucson from Windy Point is only a view of the city from above. The same applies to conceptual schemes. This should be very obvious but I have discovered that many people expect to experience big ideas - in the moment. And, I discovered that I often attempt to share a big idea by expecting an other to experience it, which is foolish, as I don't experience them either.  Consciousness is important, but it is far from the foundation of reality. We need to study how we actually come to share conceptual schemes, which must involve interactivity over time and that the sharing doesn't occur in a moment.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"583936321\",\"name\":\"Lion Kimbro\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":11}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-09T19:49:49+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"236666293087799\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Jenny Ryan\",\"id\":\"4200992\"},\"message\":\"This is beautiful.

Transformation, which I understand to be a 'deep change' towards a more encompassing level, can be understood by the means of a whole range of perspectives and 'theories'. \\nBasic, in my perspective, is that any transformation has to upset, and possibly destroy, the present homeostats - those systems that keep these systems in dynamic equilibrium and 'alive'. The reason a person or group or organisation has to go through the bottom of the U in that theory is that the \\\"resistance\\\" to change needs to essentially die before the next level can be reached. And no amount of 'fake-death' is going to take care of that (in spite of what I see of the practices of U-Theory practitioners which mostly keep the 'death' at the surface, which makes the change effected similarly shallow.) The depth of the destruction\/death of the former homestasis is equivalent to the power of transformation.\\n\\nThe evidence of transformations in history has been that only in very recent times (1989) the transformative culmination of the Western\/Soviet conflict (Cold War) happened without much bloodshed in the non-Balkan regions of Europe. \\nSo any \\\"macro-transformation\\\" theory will be highly speculative, as a result of the 'fractilisation' of the world into a new Medieval Age of an unending number of players with different amounts of influence in which 'states' play a fast eroding role.\\n\\nThe dissemination of memes and practices which they legitimize and foster, or delegitimize and hinder, is probably one of the greatest art-forms we've yet to come to grips with; this especially so because the jury on the filtering mechanisms to distinguish the usefulness of memes in a positive transformation process is, in my view, still out. Integral Theory may help, but it's very weakness in the p2p quadrant ;-) actually may rule it out as an instrument appropriate to the occasion.\\n\\nActually, finding a way to deal with this whole matter of 'macro-transformation' so that it may provide a cross-cultural Rosetta stone for Real Change, is the Holy Grail of the World-Change-Movement...\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-02-01T12:30:08+0000\",\"like_count\":6,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"230806853673743\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Willi Schroll\",\"id\":\"628414866\"},\"message\":\"'Macro-transformation' \\n\\nFIrst a excourse in newest history:\\nWe know the controversy about the \\\"role of facebook\\\" for the Arab Spring etc. WIth a certain emphasis I am stressing that \\n\\nA) there is a \\\"law of connected layers of connectivity\\\" (but \\\"emergence\\\" might be not the adequate term here) \\n\\nStructure goes like this:\\n\\n- EMPOWERMENT E1: \\nTechnological Connectivity (internet as a tech. structure)\\nempowers \\nSocial Connectivity \\n(=social reachability increased vastly with the web)\\n\\n- EMPOWERMENT E2: \\nSocial Connectivity \\nempowers \\nPolitical Connectivity \\n(= if an inconfident citizen finds that others are thinking just the same, the feeling of \\\"power of the people\\\" is increasing, and then they can reciprocically encourage to go to action on the street)\\n\\nWith E2 the \\\"divide and conquer\\\" and the \\\"spreading of fear\\\" strategy in state terrorism is undermined.\\n\\nBut it is complex.
