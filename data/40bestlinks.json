We are in transition, it's a process. The embryos of all different components already exist and their trajectory are converging towards a p2p society. The economic layer is the most important in my opinion. It will drive culture, governance and everything else.  \\nOur SENSORICA pilot project is all about p2p-rising the economy. \\nSENSORICA is a hybrid entity, composed of individuals AND small classic organizations (corporations that are recognized by the actual system), designed to evolve towards a truly p2p system, made of individuals only, by exerting pressures to dissolve the classic entities within it, into their individual components. It is hybrid for now, because we need to build bridges between the new economy that we are setting up, with the present-old economy, in order to allow transfer of resources. \\nMichel Bauwens is right, classic capital will not invest in p2p design and production directly. But we found a convoluted way to finance SENSORICA, i.e. to transfer resources from capitalism to the new economy, by playing on the fact that SENSORICA, as it stands now, a hybrid model, can be understood from 2 different perspectives: as an open and decentralized network of individuals and small (hierarchical) organizations (i.e. corporations) OR as small and independent corporations (again, recognized by the system) with access to a network of innovation. For funding we exploit the second perspective, but we operate according to the first one. \\nWe are expecting up to 80 000$ in government funding until the end of the year, we already got our first 10 000$, and our approach looks VERY promising. That is in Quebec Canada alone, and there is no conceptual barrier against a replication of the same elsewhere, where SENSORICA has members. \\nThere is an alternative free market taking shape, which will eventually replace Wall Street and other equivalent markets. The model is Kickstarter, not there yet, but on the road. We will engage in it very soon, which will provide SENSORICA additional funding. \\nAs we prove our model it will be replicated, and this will accelerate the creation of p2p markets, and will force crowdfunding to adapt to it, to become more efficient, and it will change people's opinion to trust the new model.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1102,\"length\":14}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-04-11T16:32:07+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"275286662559095\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Tiberius Brastaviceanu\",\"id\":\"100000279944184\"},\"message\":\"SENSORICA is a pilot project for the new economy.

Philip Comtois, from Montreal heart institute, affiliated with Universite de Montreal,  is a member of SENSORICA. Tactus Scientific Inc. is a small corporation member of SENSORICA. We just applied for a 25000$ ENGAGE grant for developing the Mosquito device (a SENSORICA product). The grant requires the academic lab to be in partnership with a company, which provides something to the academic project. In our case Tactus provides a Mosquito prototype, time and expertise. We have over 80% chance to get the grant. The cash will NOT flow through the value network (SENSORICA), it has to be spent by the academic lab. BUT it is used to push forward a SENSORICA project. So there is value generated for the network. \\nNext week we have a meeting with another lab from Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal for another 25 000$ ENGAGE grant. In parallel, we are working with Montreal heart institute and Ecole polytechnique for a larger team grant, for 3 years, from which there will be some cash flowing through SENSORICA in addition of the value generated from advancing SENSORICA projects. \\nBeing open innovation, we discovered that it is VERY easy to interface with academia, because researchers have NO restrictions for publishing. \\nAnyway, this is another trick we pooled out of our bag and it seams to work VERY fine!

Futurism is looking increasingly like a fool's paradise...\\\"  This strikes me as a fundamental that we should spend some time on.  To wit: what are our timelines and what forces (both human and inhuman) conspire to shape those timelines?  \\n\\nWhat assumptions are being made to drive these models?  \\n\\nWhat consequences to strategy and behaviour follow from the models?\\n\\nBy example, as Bret and I have discussed IRL, we share some similar assumptions about core forces (climate disruption, peak cheap oil, economic crisis) and what these entail for the world-as-we-know-it (hint: it aint a pretty picture).  Yet, due to what I presume are some additional and different core models, we have some disagreement about short term trajectory and optimal strategies.  \\n\\nWhile my own models don't originally stem from Seb Paquet's, I find his articulation of \\\"civilization dynamics\\\" at http:\/\/emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\/how-social-movements-happen-part-i-zenith-oss useful.   A crucial assumption that I make is that social psychology operates similar to individual psychology - it prefers to stick to a model it knows rather than leap into the unknown, even if the model it knows isn't working and that only a relatively substantial trauma can cause it to kick into \\\"explore new territory mode\\\".  *But that* once in explore new territory mode, it can deploy pattern discovery and creative destruction mechanisms that are almost unthinkable while in \\\"everything is peachy\\\" mode.  \\n\\nConsequently, I anticipate (and to some extent look forward to ) a large scale crisis similar in both shape and consequence to an alcoholic's hitting rock bottom (see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crisis#Definition_of_a_crisis) at which point *and only at which point* we (collectively) will become capable of rallying to the level of change that is necessary (and, hopefully,  sufficient) to deal with the serious dangers we face. \\n\\nSecondarily, I make the assumption that there are \\\"in the present\\\" instruments and ideas that are fundamentally \\\"of the future\\\" in the sense that they are part and parcel of the solution and not the problem.  \\\"Edge networking\\\" is a classic example.  These resources serve the dual function of hastening the collapse of the old system (ideally well in advance of a point where the rot is so severe that this collapse leads to a much larger species-extinction event) *and* serving as the \\\"scaffolding\\\" for the new model.  \\n\\nIn this context, my strategy is to:\\n\\na) Diagnose the ongoing crisis in an effort to identify \\\"singularity points\\\" (e.g., the tipping point where Mubarak goes from unassailable to fucked)\\n\\nb) Identify the scaffolding and attempt to interpolate what the other pieces of the future model will look like\\n\\nc) Assist in the formation of the new model - with an eye towards attempting to both make it the best that it can be and (recognizing that crisis often turns out badly) that the good future is more likely than the many potential bad futures.\\n\\nd) Focusing on being prepared to act decisively when the tipping point hits, recognizing that there is an almost infinite force multiplier to be found here. \\n\\nWhat say we all?\",\"message_tags\":{\"0\":[{\"id\":\"82300937\",\"name\":\"Bret Weinstein\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14}],\"895\":[{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":895,\"length\":10}]},\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQChaK1NsrLTRynD&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgetfile2.posterous.com%2Fgetfile%2Ffiles.posterous.com%2Ftemp-2011-02-21%2FhGkCBzFHeJeAsAaIvrEEgfDpEDsdkGqcJDBDDwxbmbmvyghpgCqpccBfBclp%2Fsprouts_pave_1.jpg.thumb100.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\/how-social-movements-happen-part-i-zenith-oss\",\"name\":\"How Social Movements Happen, Part I: Zenith, Ossification, Reality Shock, Emergence - EMERGENT CITIE\",\"caption\":\"emergentcities.sebpaquet.net\",\"description\":\"the model would be even better if it could account for the underlying causes in the collision between the development of the means of production (e.g. Internet) and the dominant mode of production (e.g. the private expropriation of humankind's natural and noospheric commons resources)\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yz\/r\/StEh3RhPvjk.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/216617898425972\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/216617898425972\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-01-11T10:39:36+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-01-17T17:38:45+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"736215096\",\"name\":\"Gideon Rosenblatt\"},{\"id\":\"520927385\",\"name\":\"Gunther Sonnenfeld\"},{\"id\":\"592310873\",\"name\":\"James Tyrrell\"},{\"id\":\"726263503\",\"name\":\"Michael Maranda\"},{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\"},{\"id\":\"1068899547\",\"name\":\"Mimi Hall\"},{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"536626881\",\"name\":\"Floris Koot\"},{\"id\":\"614376150\",\"name\":\"Hayden Mills\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"810528543\",\"name\":\"Jan Gordon\"},{\"id\":\"14935\",\"name\":\"Mark Frazier\"},{\"id\":\"828553957\",\"name\":\"PJ Manney\"},{\"id\":\"554482123\",\"name\":\"Kurt Laitner\"},{\"id\":\"520685736\",\"name\":\"Ragnar Fayeth Pery\"},{\"id\":\"716245883\",\"name\":\"Kristin Alford\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzE2MjQ1ODgz\",\"before\":\"NzM2MjE1MDk2\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"216641461756949\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Marilyn Mehlmann\",\"id\":\"588329139\"},\"message\":\"'Futurism' is not one thing.

This is a perfectly legitimate question and one that should be closely considered.   \\n\\nMy take (based on some knowledge and much conjecture) is that the powers that be are entirely aware of future scenarios that involve various flavor of resource conflict at a global level (there are many internal debates about what those resource conflicts will look like).  The most important strategy is based on the recognition that of the worlds 7 billion people, roughly 1 billion are extremely at risk and 3 billion are very at risk in the case of significant resource conflict.  Of these 4 billion only a small percentage live in Western Europe or the United States.  Consequently, most of the strategy orbits around what it takes to insulate the US (and key allies) from the various consequences of a major global culling.  This includes tighter policing controls within the US (particularly to safeguard against domestic terror targets) and much higher abilities to take out unconventional targets on a global level.  Fundamentally, there is an assumption that the US can \\\"close ranks\\\" and suffer only civil liberty and lifestyle changes (say a 30% reduction in standard of living) even as billions are starving in the 3rd world.  \\n\\nI do not believe that models of larger scale collapse - i.e., as the result of reverse network effects - are broadly contemplated, and that most contingency plans are an intensification of the current trajectory.   \\n\\nSo much for the deliberate.  It is really the unintended that is crucial here - after all, Von Hindenburg presumably thought he knew what he was doing before things jumped the rails in Weimar.  This is as much legal as memetic.  \\n\\nSuffice it to say that for me the question is strategic: I assume an increase in irrationalism, the legitimization of violence and polarization until the tipping point has been reached - at which point the die is cast and we see how it plays out.  \\n\\nMy internal probabilities: I'm about 30%  optimistic scenario and 70% pessimistic scenario.

Indubitably, an increasing number of oligarchs are making the fortress decision (nee Altaira).  However, my opinion (shared by the flavor of oligarch who plays in power rather than money) is that this is a relatively weak option.  Not to paint too dirty a picture, it reminds me of the wealthy jews who thought that their money could protect them from the Nazis during the tipping point in Germany.  You can pay Blackwater to guard you only so long as you are in a unique position to provide them with something they want (and can't simply take from you).  The fortress concepts I'm most interested in resonate with some of Bret's concerns.  If I'm worried about large-scale decline, I don't want Blackwater - I want the Marines.  Or, more pragmatically, I want the neo-KGB.  I don't see much plausibility in the strategy of a walled farm in upstate New York.  The semi-stable fortresses will much more likely be on the order of, say, Russia, or some natural chunk of the US.  Money-oligarchs who control anything of real value will quickly find out the meaning of power when their policing forces (that allow them to be local potentates) are vaporized by elite military.

Consider our most recent case-studies.  Egyptian masses were able to wedge between Mubarak and the Generals - but it remains to be seen whether they can wedge between the Generals and the Army itself.  Tunisia seems to have done well, while Bahrain and Syria have not.  From an #OWS perspective, the police are *much* more problematic than the US military for now (and for quite some time to come).  While there are authoritarians and fascists in both communities, the latter (particularly the officer corps) are *substantially* more healthy than the former.

Here's a condensed version of the rest.\\n\\nOn New Years Eve, the President (a constitutional scholar) signed NDAA, reducing the entire list of american rights to privileges that exist for any individual at the sole discretion of the president himself. No matter who that is, from now on. \\n\\nNo court. No appeal. No right to see evidence, or confront accusers. You can simply be taken away forever. The right to have you tortured while you are away traveled earlier, under separate cover.\\n\\nWhat happened on January 1st is: nothing.

They still haven't as of two weeks later.\\n\\nI'm sorry if I'm out of sorts.

In essence, buttressing averts the more binary constructs tied to \\\"if\/then\\\" or \\\"better than\\\" scenarios, or \\\"new models\\\" that require scaffolding of any kind. Buttressing supports human walls that are created regardless of moral or secular or idealogical ambiguities, or those which might have hierarchical schemes, either fear-based and\/or knowledge based. Buttressing actions contingency groups that don't just subvert \\\"higher authority\\\" movements, but those that also form out of chaos \u2014 vis-a-vis Monti Di Pieta or a favorite amongst this group, Junto. \\n\\nHow buttressing is leveraged in a technological or an Elysian sense I haven't quite thought through (nor could I \u2014 this would likely become a construct built through a cooperative), but I will say that it focuses on emergence as having interjective qualities, rather than simpler measures that induce \\\"macro\\\" or \\\"micro\\\" or \\\"subtle\\\" or \\\"radical\\\" patterns that affect an intentional result, or a future, to embrace complexity. Allow me to provide some context, and use money (and it's future state - another favorite topic here) as an example of how model-free duality drives the commercial world we currently inhabit... For good and for worse.\\n\\nSince Jordan referred to the Jewish fortress of mercantilists who paid for protection during (and before and after) the Holocaust, I will start there. Some of you know that my father is a Holocaust survivor (born in Upper Silesia in 1932 and fled near Auschwitz to Shanghai in 1938). Many cite Kristallnacht as the tipping point in the war, but this probably only served as an affront to Austrian parliament, since Germany was undergoing a reformation of sorts and bankers on either side were torn by, among other things, secularism. Plans were likely made well before WWI to support the \\\"system\\\" and to find figureheads to run it \u2014 independently of the moral or even economic implications \u2014 and to boot, many, many Jews were a part of this accidental regime. (I know, my grandfather and my great grandfather were among them).\\n\\nWhat happened immediately following the release of  Morgenthau's \\\"Politics Among Nations\\\"? Isreal was formed in 1948. What ensued has been a litany of progressive leanings on all sides, all in the name of money. Yet, the \\\"power structure\\\" hangs in the balance, as the Israeli fortress (not exactly a system of any kind) requires funding from US banks to the tune of $58B per year. Was Zionist movement in the West Bank the tipping point? I doubt it.\\n\\nLet's move on to Cuba. Many cite Playa Giron as the \\\"secret tipping point\\\" of The Bay of Pigs invasion (an \\\"invasion\\\" that was spread and hedged over years of political grooming) and the U.S.'s apparent failure to build an \\\"emerging democracy nation-state\\\".  Then of course, there were rumors that this Castro-run state was run by organized crime \u2014 you know, \\\"the Italians\\\". But we all know that mercantile bankers \u2013 Jews and Gentiles alike, some Muslims \u2013 were the string-pullers in a society funded by experimentation, and, aghast, to this day, Cuba hosts one of the most anonymously subsistent economies, as well as one of the highest literacy rates and lowest rates of infectious disease in the world (save for long-standing cultural mores, but that is fodder for another conversation\u2026)\\n\\nTo hark back to a previous point in history, do we honestly believe that Monti Di Pieta was funded by \\\"radical\\\" or \\\"puritanical\\\" or \\\"progressive\\\" Christian sects? Hardly. The lenders were Jews \u2013 later Italian Jews \u2013 who backed both sides of the marketplace until regimes such as Luther's found some major cracks in the \\\"power structure\\\" and shifted things towards a neo-facist or neo-feudalist state.\\n\\nWas a student revolt a tipping point for Tiananmen Square?\\nHow 'bout the Berlin Wall?\\nDo we think these \\\"singular\\\" power structures have ever existed in Tunisia? Egypt? Syria?\\n\\nMy larger point is this: Human intention is intended to be misguided. Our role within the edges, it seems to me, is to buttress transitional movements that transcend the \\\"alternatives\\\" or what amount to \\\"the replacements\\\". Duality is the ideaology that the edges degrade and then move us toward collective, or cooperative intention.\\n\\nMy larger belief is this: 'we' are inherently stronger than 'them' because greed has always had its limitations. And it's the ability to see through the \\\"eyes of the other side\\\" that allows us to be spiritually and mentally free, whether our wealth is material, immaterial, concordant or recursive. Operationally, I liken this to much of what Mark Frasier has advocated around NGOs, but I would add that greed and enlightenment share in recursive values that ultimately bend with fluid, focused contingencies \u2014 people who have suffered through geolocal context (war, admonition, injustice, etc.) but who truly believe in the 'we'.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-17T05:29:07+0000\",\"like_count\":3,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"220199194734509\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Gunther Sonnenfeld\",\"id\":\"520927385\"},\"message\":\"...

Remember that the countries who have fought against tiered legislation in support of it (Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Germany et al) -- some that are dubbed \\\"socialist\\\" nations -- are countries who have very strong educational ideals, great small business support and strong social benefits (stable healthcare, very few homeless people, etc.), and while there is still an uneven distribution of institutional wealth, much of this money is being poured into infrastructural development, and not just to bootstrap labor unions, who are having a hard time in their own right finding new footing with renewables and other sustainable energy models commoditizing their value.

In this day and age, I suspect it can actually stay alive longer than most of the projects or organizations it generates.\\n\\nI think I basically want to be part of a scenius, and I think this very group, The Next Edge, is a coherent scene that foreshadows the nature of an emerging \u2018online scenius\u2019. Some of the conditions outlined at http:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-conditions-favor-the-emergence-of-scenius are already fulfilled here. \\n\\nHowever, I think our group is still missing a few key capabilities. Chief among them, in my book, is the ability to go beyond conversation and knowledge sharing and move into open collaboration.\\n\\nI\u2019d love it if a handful of us were able to get excited and playful about some simple Thing That Should Exist (e.g. \u2018A Poignant Guide to the SocEnt Scene\u2019), and efficiently mobilize our collective resources to just Get Them Done quickly.\\n\\nBasically, we should go for hits. If we can pull off a few small capers, maybe we can challenge ourselves to pull off something more ambitious... you get my drift.\\n\\nEngaging in small projects has many benefits. Some obvious ones are learning and getting to know potential collaborators better (both of which are sure shots, even if the project fails). Engaging in small projects that Just Could Get Big (Cause You Never Know) might be a way to conduct modest-risk experiments towards real impact.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: given the diversity, collective knowledge and wisdom, and quality of engagement of people in this group, I don\u2019t find it difficult to imagine that it could turn into a decent launchpad for promising initiatives, and I believe we should think a bit about this.

Examples are Deliberative Polling\u00ae, GitHub, amongst others. Personally I like what the MIT Center for Civic Media is working on.\\n\\nhttp:\/\/civic.mit.edu\/projects\\n\\nThere are other subgroups within the Greater Next edge (GNE) working on other things. I happen to be part of those interested in building the platform needed if we can't find it. Harlan T Wood is working on Software_Zero, Glistening Deepwater has a series of websites putting together vast amounts of resources\/intellectual capital.\\n\\nThe main idea seems to be that Facebook is failing us, in fact, any platform that does not allow the creation of a true knowledge base or repository is pointless to use. LinkedIn has had groups and conversations going for years and thousands of pages long and the data is stuck in a silo. Searching and navigating the conversations is difficult..\\n\\nThere are others working on other projects, because what I mention isn't a panacea to cure all ills. It's just to say that I've observed the same thing, what I've been calling the failure of collaboration.\\n\\nTask management and project management solutions have been tested. We are putting together preliminary insights\/reviews. Others also have their hands full with real projects \\\"on the ground\\\" and cannot invest hours of time contributing to stuff online. That is partly why the repository idea would be fruit-bearing, because those people could browse\/navigate through conversations.. and not just conversations, but conversations, debates, dialogues that have already been processed, refined, 'mined', in a kind of peer-review process.\\n\\nFacebook makes it hard to find stuff. Findability and Discoverability is next to nil. It's very noisy. I have been building my own model of how Facebook Groups work - not based on how it works archtiecturally or how Facebook designed Groups, but how I see a flock of people using this particular group and how I see it failing everyday in real-time.\\n\\nFor instance. Seb Paquet started a conversation recently asking about people.. um wait.. see I can't find it.. anyway someone asked something and then Seb and others were making a list of people, maybe SuperHeroes or something or specific fields, domains, specific 'parts' of the whole.. a list of people doing sh*t. Now why can't I hyperlink that conversation into this conversation as a reference? In fact, to be quite honest, I had to scroll up just now to verify what thread I was actually in.. I'm in about 50 different Facebook Groups and get 20 Group notifications per hour, sometimes less, sometimes much more.. I don't even know what thread I am posting in anymore, or where it was I read something.. This is Facebook, it dilutes things, it makes things fuzzy, it is not designed for persistence in discussions or debates, dialogue.\\n\\nPart of it can be solved by people adopting some process or methodology. Good luck with that. Even if we already had the perfect platform, we'd still have the adoption problem. We'd have to make it 'designed-for-adoption' first and foremost, or else we'd never get everyone using it.. So there are many paradoxes involved and many people trying to solve them.\\n\\nI'd say the vast majority of members of this group either never even read the threads or rarely engage in them, or if they engage, it's just to shoot the sh*t, discuss things, and not solve problems.\\n\\nA good number of people I would call experts. Call them the household philosophers. They read through threads and either flip them around or reverse-engineer lines of thought, break down barriers and debunk myths, distortions, biases.. Together they maybe form the Conceptual Clearinghouse..\\n\\nMany are also invested in the funding\/sustainability\/gathering of resources part. Those people are rarely at the forefront. You won't see someone offering to fund a project on Facebook very often. There are a bunch of people not on Facebook involved with people that are on Facebook. Zaq Mosher has been going in that direction with the Colaboratori, leveraging networks on-the-ground etc. Some are just on Twitter also.. some have migrated to Google+. Anyway I've said enough, I hope I'm not totally in the wrong ballpark, or in the wrong thread again.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"668410120\",\"name\":\"Sam Rose\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":8},{\"id\":\"739008859\",\"name\":\"Helene Finidori\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":339,\"length\":15},{\"id\":\"604081563\",\"name\":\"Harlan T Wood\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":997,\"length\":13},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":1040,\"length\":20},{\"id\":\"121300030\",\"name\":\"Seb Paquet\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":2607,\"length\":10},{\"id\":\"669842574\",\"name\":\"Zaq Mosher\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":4575,\"length\":10}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-09-29T01:34:31+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"355603297860764\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\",\"id\":\"1063904902\"},\"message\":\"Found yesterday via my network.

Gore & Associates in 1958. At that time the whole organization of this company was futuristic and science fiction in the eyes of commoners. Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore who founded it together with his wife Vieve had been additionally proclaimed anti-manager. The organization resided on principles like complete decentralization, self-organizing teams, flat hierarchy and organizational chaos. The concept of the amoeba is a biocybernetic metaphor since its original ancient Greek meaning implies change or changeability. Especially a known subform of the  Amoeba Proteus the so called Amoeba Chaos Chaos underlines the connection between chaos theory and this kind of organization. The amoeba organization relies on two simple but strong principles: (1) the organization is a process,  not a structure, and (2) the organization is a complex (chaotic) system.\\\"\",\"message_tags\":{\"27\":[{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":27,\"length\":12}]},\"link\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"name\":\"http:\/\/indecs.eu\/2011\/indecs2011-pp39-55.pdf\",\"caption\":\"indecs.eu\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/264087583679003\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-03-24T14:07:46+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-03-28T19:42:59+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"579781763\",\"name\":\"Paul Mock\"},{\"id\":\"635786642\",\"name\":\"David Hood\"},{\"id\":\"100001413664942\",\"name\":\"Michelle Holliday\"},{\"id\":\"1422975257\",\"name\":\"Andrew Philip Trabulsi\"},{\"id\":\"225017\",\"name\":\"Thomas Maiorana\"},{\"id\":\"696561163\",\"name\":\"Kathia Laszlo\"},{\"id\":\"1045338394\",\"name\":\"Lucie Newcomb\"},{\"id\":\"19301400\",\"name\":\"Milicent Johnson\"},{\"id\":\"553340634\",\"name\":\"Maura Dilley\"},{\"id\":\"664888262\",\"name\":\"Flora Moon\"},{\"id\":\"4200992\",\"name\":\"Jenny Ryan\"},{\"id\":\"317775\",\"name\":\"Bal\u00e1zs Lazlo Karafi\u00e1th\"},{\"id\":\"1314985753\",\"name\":\"Jennifer Sertl\"},{\"id\":\"704660253\",\"name\":\"Bruce Randolph Tizes\"},{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\"},{\"id\":\"702645559\",\"name\":\"Warren Te Brugge\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"NzAyNjQ1NTU5\",\"before\":\"NjgyMzE1OTQ3\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"264094120345016\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\",\"id\":\"1482404646\"},\"message\":\"David Hodgson Excellent, I like the idea to continue our thinking in new social organizations.

I want to bring David Hodgson into this since I know he and I will have a conversation about this at some point. I was thinking about this kind of personal profile over the last week independently and was worried about scalability. I guess there will be room for creative juxtaposition with personal narration being at the heart of it. I presume that artists can do best with such profile. My friend Jennifer Rittenhouse West for example who just joined Next Edge recently is a brilliant physicist and an artist too. I can visualize her profile including a magnificant self portrait she painted and shared with me in private a few days ago. What ever one juxtaposes, I find a self narrated clip such as that of Venessa a pre-requisite and a core. BTW Venessa, I would recommend editing your sample profile in your Emergent By Design blog to have this heartsong at the center of it.

The old, traditional academic channel is not a good channel for attracting attention, funding, people, or preventing other people from competing with you.\\n\\n\\\"Being open, you're much less likely to have someone competitive emerge and you're also much more likely to find somebody who wants to come to work with you. Innovation is happening everywhere -- not just in the Ivy League schools. And that's why we're working with you guys [at Wired] too -- in the old days, academics didn't want to be in popular magazines. Openness is a survival trait.\\\" \\\"\\n\\ncc Liz McLellan\",\"message_tags\":{\"970\":[{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":970,\"length\":12}]},\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQBPfhb4AgZ2mAyv&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdni.wired.co.uk%2F620x620%2Fg_j%2FJoi-Ito.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/magazine\/archive\/2012\/11\/features\/open-university\",\"name\":\"Open university: Joi Ito plans a radical reinvention of MIT's Media Lab (Wired UK)\",\"caption\":\"www.wired.co.uk\",\"description\":\"Joi Ito plans a radical reinvention  of MIT\u2019s Media Lab \u2013- with the building as just one hub on the network\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yq\/r\/SC2ZmEkfI-X.png\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/373230012764759\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/373230012764759\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-11-16T02:49:14+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-11-18T00:07:16+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"590346988\",\"name\":\"Iiro Niemi\"},{\"id\":\"571865313\",\"name\":\"Luke Stanley\"},{\"id\":\"570407302\",\"name\":\"John Kellden\"},{\"id\":\"633613255\",\"name\":\"Daniel Lemire\"},{\"id\":\"682315947\",\"name\":\"Irma Wilson\"},{\"id\":\"600852864\",\"name\":\"Joel C.

In either case, capital (i.e. the money to buy equipment and supplies) can be either an investment or a cost, as when capital must be borrowed, the repayment with interest is a cost.  This aspect is not new, or unique.  Labor investment in an organization is a common feature of start up small business partnerships, in which the partners work without salary until the business is established.\\n\\nAnother distinction exists in the forms.  In a CST we distribute what we produce directly to the labor that produced it.  That eliminates whole regulatory regimes such as taxation and securities regulation.  It also means that we do not have market restraints.  The market restricts production to that which can be sold at a profit.  In a CST we can produce for whatever demand there is within the organization.\\n\\nI disagree with the statement you quote regarding the nature of scarcity in the system.  It is the nature of markets that what is exchanged is that which is relatively scare to someone else in the market who has the money to pay for it.  When we only measure value in a market based medium of exchange, then we only value that which is relatively scarce.  The key then is to find a way to value that which humans need to thrive, which could be abundant, such as food, clothing, shelther,  education and health care, and find a different (non-market based) way to produce those things.\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"528245547\",\"name\":\"Michel\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":6},{\"id\":\"1406709310\",\"name\":\"Monika\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":21,\"length\":6}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-12T16:52:37+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339518286135932\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Michel Bauwens\",\"id\":\"528245547\"},\"message\":\"thanks David, will expore it more, though I'm  not sure what your last paragraph refers to, since I agree with it, and I think, this is exactly what I think as well, i.e. there can be an outgrowing of markets to the degree that we succeed in finding successfull non-market forms.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-13T14:44:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"339543882800039\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Braden\",\"id\":\"578038073\"},\"message\":\"Sorry, I should be more specific.

Had I known that reputation was the way one succeeds in the creative\/gift economy, I would have been far more successful before now, and I would be making a lot more money from that success by now.\\n\\nI will note that more theoretical work needs to be done on the gift economy and the role of reputation in it, though.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-06-13T18:38:19+0000\",\"like_count\":1,\"user_likes\":false}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MzE1NzI4NTk1MTgxNTY4\",\"before\":\"MzE1MTM2NTE1MjQwNzc2\"}}}},{\"id\":\"120497731371323_227362544018174\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\",\"id\":\"516134310\"},\"to\":{\"data\":[{\"name\":\"The Next Edge\",\"id\":\"120497731371323\"}]},\"message\":\"I'm honoured to have played a part in bringing this into the world.\\nhttp:\/\/howtosavetheworld.ca\/2012\/01\/27\/group-works-card-deck-a-joyful-announcement\/\",\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQB9vfdmsrgPrYXe&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhowtosavetheworld.ca%2Fimages%2Fkey-card-colour-650x423.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/howtosavetheworld.ca\/2012\/01\/27\/group-works-card-deck-a-joyful-announcement\/\",\"name\":\"Group Works Card Deck \u2013 A Joyful Announcement \u00ab  how to save the world\",\"caption\":\"howtosavetheworld.ca\",\"description\":\"For the past couple of years a group of professional facilitators and others experienced in and interested in improving \u201cgroup process\u201d has been working to create a \u201cpattern language\u201d (an integrated collection of practices, processes, qualities and other phenomena that \u201cwork\u201d in many different group...\",\"icon\":\"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yD\/r\/aS8ecmYRys0.gif\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/227362544018174\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/120497731371323\/posts\/227362544018174\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"link\",\"created_time\":\"2012-01-28T00:25:20+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2012-01-28T20:57:26+0000\",\"likes\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"1346647235\",\"name\":\"Katie Teague\"},{\"id\":\"588329139\",\"name\":\"Marilyn Mehlmann\"},{\"id\":\"1089740462\",\"name\":\"Lauren Higgins\"},{\"id\":\"501424048\",\"name\":\"John Love\"},{\"id\":\"538318274\",\"name\":\"Miranda Willems\"},{\"id\":\"671242827\",\"name\":\"Sharon Ede\"},{\"id\":\"536626881\",\"name\":\"Floris Koot\"},{\"id\":\"689061538\",\"name\":\"Jenny Yancey\"},{\"id\":\"1063904902\",\"name\":\"Bernd Nurnberger\"},{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\"},{\"id\":\"703220850\",\"name\":\"Steve Brant\"},{\"id\":\"630505808\",\"name\":\"Venessa Miemis\"},{\"id\":\"578568173\",\"name\":\"Timothy Rayner\"},{\"id\":\"876880077\",\"name\":\"Amy Kirschner\"},{\"id\":\"1120956519\",\"name\":\"Liz McLellan\"},{\"id\":\"1482404646\",\"name\":\"Giorgio Bertini\"},{\"id\":\"1204764827\",\"name\":\"Glistening Deepwater\"},{\"id\":\"528444051\",\"name\":\"Gil Friend\"},{\"id\":\"100000933562785\",\"name\":\"Lyre Calliope\"}],\"paging\":{\"cursors\":{\"after\":\"MTAwMDAwOTMzNTYyNzg1\",\"before\":\"MTM0NjY0NzIzNQ==\"}}},\"comments\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"227362940684801\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lyre Calliope\",\"id\":\"100000933562785\"},\"message\":\"Sexy.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-01-28T00:25:58+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"227363237351438\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lyre Calliope\",\"id\":\"100000933562785\"},\"message\":\"Oh, hey!

What would it have\/do that would bring you value?\\n\\nI appreciate any feedback.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n- Venessa Miemis\",\"message_tags\":{\"246\":[{\"id\":\"652503168\",\"name\":\"David Hodgson\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":246,\"length\":13}]},\"picture\":\"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQBJ36dh4ZnOXROD&w=154&h=154&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accelerating.org%2Ffusion%2F2002%2Fimages%2Fbellcliffs2.jpg\",\"link\":\"http:\/\/www.accelerating.org\/fusion\/index.html\",\"name\":\"Fusion: ASF's Annual Personal Foresight Retreat\",\"caption\":\"www.accelerating.org\",\"description\":\"ASF's          invited annual gathering of high-integrity futurists,          coming together every year for a weekend of hiking and reflection in a          beautiful location, to help each other improve our personal and social          foresight on a sustainable budget.

The sum of all that human action represents a kind of collaboration made possible only by competition -- that is by the attempts by each of multitudes of interested parties to access and retain resources for the execution of their conflicting plans. He believed that this chaos of ventures summons, utilizes, and transmits more knowledge, written and tacit, than is possible in any other way. And that's why he considered boundaries defining personal and group domains so important. Those boundaries eliminate the need for comprehensive agreement, and make competition possible, and thereby produce a collaboration that goes far beyond anything that could be designed.

That chain ownership--or hierarchy--in turn informed and justified the relational patterns we've come to know as the \\\"Great Man\\\" model of leadership.\\n\\nWith the the dawning of the knowledge era and, even more importantly, the emerging power and influence of network dynamics (aided, in no short measure, by mobile communication technology) the whole notion of a \\\"commodity\\\" has been radically rescripted. It's no long a field of corn, or a iron mine, or a shoe factory that can be used to generate capital. A set of relationships, or an ability to combine ideas, or a particular way of accessing information have suddenly become core commodities and these commodities don't follow the traditional lines of ownership as material commodities generally do. As a result the lines of authority and the relational patterns they suggest have likewise experienced radical shifts.\\n\\nThus we have an unprecedented shift in the nature of leadership that goes far beyond a softer and gentler approach.

They defamed the speakers, in trying to justify the decisions, which they claimed were made by their anonymous scientific panel. They made claims about what the speeches purportedly said that were simply not true, and in fact they have apologized for the original reasons posted on their blogs for removing the videos (probably because their lawyers told them to do so to avoid litigation). In the process of rewriting their blog posts and publishing supplemental blog posts to explain their reason for (re)moving the videos, they actually dug themselves into an even deeper hole, as these revised arguments are even feebler and more offensive than the original ones. The argument that Hancock's video had to be (re)moved because it might be seen in schools as TED's approval for young people to be using ayahuasca (and hence exposed TED to legal risks) is absolutely preposterous.\\n\\nAs for the issue of removal vs moving, they were moved from the immensely popular TED YouTube channel, where most people go to find TED(x) talks, including full transcripts, to the TED blog, in the middle of the aforementioned weak and insulting critiques of them.

The NY Review of Books founding editor, Robert Silver, had a telling comment on this in the wonderful interview with him that appeared in New York magazine:\\n\\n\\\"If a novel is published, we have a novel review. If poetry is produced, if a play or a movie or a TV show is produced, there are the forms of criticism we know. With the new social media, with much of the content of the Internet, there are very few if any critical forms that are appropriate. They are thought to be somewhere partially in a private world. Facebook is a medium in which privacy is, or at least is thought to be, in some way crucial. The premise, at least, is that of belonging to a family, a circle of friends. And there\u2019s another premise, that any voice should have its moment. And so there seems a resistance to intrusive criticism.\\n\\nBut this means that billions of words go without the faintest sign of assessment. And yet, if one cares about language, if one cares about the sensibility in which language is expressed, and if one cares about the values that underlie our use of language, such as affection, privacy, honesty, cogency, clarity\u2014then these media, it would seem to me, should qualify as the subject of criticism. We seem at the edge of a vast, expanding ocean of words, an ocean growing without any critical perspective whatever being brought to bear on it. To me, as an editor, that seems an enormous absence.\\\"\\n\\nhttp:\/\/nymag.com\/news\/features\/robert-silvers-2013-4\/#print\",\"message_tags\":[{\"id\":\"516134310\",\"name\":\"Dave Pollard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":12}],\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2013-04-16T07:19:59+0000\",\"like_count\":2,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"440899259331167\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"John Hall\",\"id\":\"100004356039609\"},\"message\":\"Way to rock the comments, Dave!

He reports that in his sleep, the Angel of Truth appeared to him and, in a blinding revelation like a flash of lightning, revealed a secret which would \u201clay the foundations of a new method of understanding and a new and marvelous science.\u201d In the light of what the angel had told him, [the soldier, Rene] Descartes fervently set to work on an ambitious treatise called \u201cRules for the Direction of the Mind.\u201d The objective of his \u201cnew and marvelous science\u201d was nothing less than to describe how the mind works. For Descartes, who was to invent analytical geometry, there was no question but that the model for this task was to be found in mathematics. There would be axioms (\u201cclear and distinct ideas\u201d that none could doubt) and, connecting the axioms in logical progressions, a finite number of simple, utterly sensible rules that were equally self-evident. The result would be an expanding body of knowledge.\\n\\nDescartes never finished his treatise; the project was abandoned after the eighteenth rule\u2014perhaps because it proved more difficult than he had anticipated. He did, however, eventually do justice to the angel\u2019s inspiration in the famous Discourse on Method, which is often taken to be the founding document of modern philosophy. Descartes\u2019 project was the first of many similar attempts in the modern world to codify the laws of thought; almost all of them follow his lead in using mathematics as their model. In our day, the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science can be seen as part of this tradition, but now united with technology and centering upon a physical mechanism\u2014the computer\u2014which supposedly embodies these laws.\\n\\nThe epistemological systems that have been developed since the time of Descartes have often been ingenious. They surely illuminate many aspects of the mind. But all of them are marked by the same curious fact. They leave out the Angel of Truth\u2014as indeed Descartes himself did. For he never returned to the source of his inspiration. His writings spare no time for the role of dreams, revelations, insights as the wellsprings of thought. Instead, he gave all his attention to formal, logical procedures that supposedly begin with zero, from a position of radical doubt...'\\n-Roszak, Theodore.

Immaterial values such as \\nsocial justice or environmental protection are accorded \\nso much importance that they influence the attitude \\nGermans have towards the economic system; for exam\u00ad\\nple, 88 percent of respondents think that the current \\nsystem is not suitable for taking environmental pro\u00ad\\ntection, resource conservation, and social redistribu\u00ad\\ntion, adequately into account. The majority would like \\na \u2018new economic system\u2019, and does not really believe \\nin the resilience and crisis resistance of purely market\u00ad\\ndriven  economic systems. Particularly younger Ger\u00ad\\nmans do not trust the market\u2019s self\u00adrestorative powers, \\nand call for improved compatibility between economic \\ngrowth and environmental protection. The survey sub\u00ad\\nstantiates that in Germany, postmaterialist thinking is \\nby no means limited to the well\u00adoff and educated. For \\nthe majority of respondents, health, social relation\u00ad\\nships and environmental status were deemed to be far \\nmore important sources of personal quality of life than\u2018increasing money and wealth\u2019 (Figure 2.1\u00ad1). 75  % of \\nrespondents with higher education entrance qualifica\u00ad\\ntions, and 69  % of respondents with a mere school leav\u00ad\\ning certificate, agreed with the statement \u2018I  consider \\nwealth to be less important than environmental pro\u00ad\\ntection and debt reduction\u2019 (Bertelsmann Foundation, \\n2010).\\nThe increasingly sceptical view of the current eco\u00ad\\nnomic system\u2019s performance and its externalities rests \\nnot least on the realisation of the system\u2019s social costs \\nthat result from economic activities relying on short\u00ad\\nterm benefits and gains (Section 1.1), but also on the \\nimprovements of material wealth in low\u00adincome house\u00ad\\nhold settings, leaving space for alternative, postma\u00ad\\nterialist value\u00adorientations and  lifestyles.

The same of course happens with communism, where the critics point to the realities of the systems that existed, while those defending the idea refer to the unrealized ideal definition.

Using Abandon Mills around the NE is excellent way to build infrastructure of Our research etc into rebuilding USA from the inside out. From the Emergent Beauty of rich natural resources. \\n\\nI lived all over the NE so I am very familiar with this History.. My favorite Mill area is a sweet little community outside of Hartford VT and Hanover NH.. Near Woodstock VT called Quechee .It is the site of the Quechee Gorge on the Ottauquechee River and is also the home to the Quechee Lakes planned community initiated in the late 1960s, which also brought to the community the small Quechee Lakes Ski Area in the 1970s. \\n\\nThe History of WHY Quechee was created in first place in 1700 to build Mills using this Powerful water and it grand falls to generate the Mills that made all kinds of products with the most recent being Glass . Quechee is now home to Irish glass blower Simon Pearce purchased the former woolen mill in 1980. The building that drove the village economy for about 100 years again took on a new commercial use, this time for glass blowing factory and pottery produc tion and fine dining. I believe Simon Pearce is using the Power from the Water to operate their Mill for glass blowing and pottery making  !\\n\\nStarting in Chatham NY there is potential to  start the inhabitation of building new communities as there are many empty mills and old wonderful history from 1600 1700  like this all over the North East ! Bringing life to them will bring attention to the fact these mills were run by the water power which is so glorious in aliveness ! \\n\\nQuechee was also known for a picturesque covered bridge at the site of the old Quechee mill, which now houses a commercial glass-blowing facility. The bridge was severely damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene (2011).\\n\\nThis unexpected flooding due to rains of Irene last Aug 2011 was due to having a harsh winter of much snow and ground still saturated but more so it was due to the fact our ecosystem of water movement in USA is very unhealthy due to so much is polluted as the water makes it way down the USA into Everglades for drainage out into the seas.. It is Everglades that is really messed up which is big part of problem to creating back up like this that does this flash flooding around country.\\n\\nEarly Town proprietors saw the value of river land. In 1765, they voted to grant 600 acres adjacent to the river falls as an incentive to attract saw and grist mills. They envisioned mills bringing the Town job and growth benefits. By 1774, the Town conveyed land to John Marsh providing he establish a saw and grist mill within two years. Both mills were built and operational within four years. Over the next forty years, the mill property changed hands many times.\\nQuechee Historic Mill District - Town of Hartford Vermont\\nwww.hartford-vt.org\/downloads\/492\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2012-08-03T11:19:53+0000\",\"like_count\":0,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"336258166461944\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Cassandra Rose\",\"id\":\"100001388966789\"},\"message\":\"The author of this is  Michael Forrester is a spiritual counselor and is a practicing motivational speaker for corporations in Japan, Canada and the United States.

The man-made rules and regulations that are used to govern the people are necessary only as long as the people don\u2019t know how to live in accordance with the natural laws of life, for lack of self love. This trend is shifting fast and the turbulence that is gripping mankind is all part of it. Humankind is waking up, and there is nothing that can stop it now.

No government can control all points.No Language Barriers - Advances in software afford almost simultaneous translation across multiple platforms.No Friction - Business models based upon lack of information will fail.No Spin - Multiple access points means less opportunity for special interests to control people by spinning information.Infinite Collaboration - Think it, design it, share it, fail and start again at high speed.Commonality - People discover that they really are not that different after all, which aligns interests.\\nTraditional government will soon fragment. The existing government as we know it will change rapidly. Today\u2019s government paradigms worked for getting things done for the last century with methodologies that cannot operate with the upgraded thought processes of collective consciousness. The people of earth have decided it\u2019s time for a shift and governments will have to either adapt or be left behind as archaic and outdated controls. If they do adapt it will be government 2.0 for the people.

How will emerging leaders essentially give back enough to the system that supports them to ensure continued support?\\n\\nA: The institute will be based off of systems of mutuality rather than reciprocity. People who give to the Institute (providing housing, resources, contacts, mentorship, etc) will only give that which they have in abundance and can give freely. Reciprocity implies that one offers something with an expectation or hope of positive future responses. Mutuality operates from a basis of abundance where people who offer resources to emerging leaders do so not because they expect increasing returns, but because they offer something they can give of freely that simultaneously supports their own intrinsic motivations.
